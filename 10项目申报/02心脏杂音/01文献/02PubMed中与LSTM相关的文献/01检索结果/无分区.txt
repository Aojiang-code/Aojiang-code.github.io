AB  - Heart sound classification is one of the non-invasive methods for early detection 
      of the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause for deaths. In recent 
      years, Computer Audition (CA) technology has become increasingly sophisticated, 
      auxiliary diagnosis technology of heart disease based on CA has become a popular 
      research area. This paper proposes a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
      model for heart sound classification. To improve the classification accuracy of 
      heart sound, we design a classification algorithm combining classical Residual 
      Network (ResNet) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model performance is 
      evaluated in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenges 2016 datasets using a 2D 
      time-frequency feature. We extract the four features from different filter-bank 
      coefficients, including Filterbank (Fbank), Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficients 
      (MFSCs), and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The experimental 
      results show the MFSCs feature outperforms the other features in the proposed CNN 
      model. The proposed model performs well on the test set, particularly the F1 
      score of 84.3 % - the accuracy of 84.4 %, the sensitivity of 84.3 %, and the 
      specificity of 85.6 %. Compared with the classical ResNet model, an accuracy of 
      4.9 % improvement is observed in the proposed model.

AB  - Heart sound analysis is significant for early diagnosis of congenital heart 
      disease. A novel method of heart sound classification was proposed in this paper, 
      in which the traditional mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) method was 
      improved by using the Fisher discriminant half raised-sine function (F-HRSF) and 
      an integrated decision network was used as classifier. It does not rely on 
      segmentation of the cardiac cycle. Firstly, the heart sound signals were framed 
      and windowed. Then, the features of heart sounds were extracted by using improved 
      MFCC, in which the F-HRSF was used to weight sub-band components of MFCC 
      according to the Fisher discriminant ratio of each sub-band component and the 
      raised half sine function. Three classification networks, convolutional neural 
      network (CNN), long and short-term memory network (LSTM), and gated recurrent 
      unit (GRU) were combined as integrated decision network. Finally, the 
      two-category classification results were obtained through the majority voting 
      algorithm. An accuracy of 92.15%, sensitivity of 91.43%, specificity of 92.83%, 
      corrected accuracy of 92.01%, and F score of 92.13% were achieved using the novel 
      signal processing techniques. It shows that the algorithm has great potential in 
      early diagnosis of congenital heart disease.

AB  - Cardiac Auscultation, an integral part of the physical examination of a patient, 
      is essential for early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The ability 
      to accurately diagnose the heart sounds requires experience and expertise, which 
      is lacking in doctors in the early years of clinical practice. Thus, there is a 
      need for an automatic diagnostic tool that would aid medical practitioners with 
      their diagnosis. We propose novel hybrid architectures for classification of 
      unsegmented heart sounds to normal and abnormal classes. We propose two methods, 
      with and without the conventional feature extraction step in the classification 
      pipeline. We demonstrate that the F score using the approach with conventional 
      feature extraction is 1.25 (absolute) more than using a baseline implementation 
      on the Physionet dataset. We also introduce a mechanism to tag predictions as 
      unsure and compare results with a varying threshold.

TI  - A novel heart sound segmentation algorithm via multi-feature input and neural 
      network with attention mechanism.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ac9da6 [doi]
AB  - Objective. Heart sound segmentation (HSS), which aims to identify the exact 
      positions of the first heart sound(S1), second heart sound(S2), the duration of 
      S1, systole, S2, and diastole within a cardiac cycle of phonocardiogram (PCG), is 
      an indispensable step to find out heart health. Recently, some neural 
      network-based methods for heart sound segmentation have shown good 
      performance.Approach. In this paper, a novel method was proposed for HSS exactly 
      using One-Dimensional Convolution and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory neural 
      network with Attention mechanism (C-LSTM-A) by incorporating the 0.5-order smooth 
      Shannon entropy envelope and its instantaneous phase waveform (IPW), and third 
      intrinsic mode function (IMF-3) of PCG signal to reduce the difficulty of neural 
      network learning features.Main results. An average F1-score of 96.85 was achieved 
      in the clinical research dataset (Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital heart 
      sound dataset) and an average F1-score of 95.68 was achieved in 2016 
      PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset using the novel method.Significance. The 
      experimental results show that this method has advantages for normal PCG signals 
      and common pathological PCG signals, and the segmented fundamental heart 
      sound(S1, S2), systole, and diastole signal components are beneficial to the 
      study of subsequent heart sound classification.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study performed on Parallel Convolutional 
      Neural Network (PCNN) toward detecting heart abnormalities from the heart sound 
      signals. The PCNN preserves dynamic contents of the signal in a parallel 
      combination of the recurrent neural network and a Convolutional Neural Network 
      (CNN). The performance of the PCNN is evaluated and compared to the one obtained 
      from a Serial form of the Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) as well as two 
      other baseline studies: a Long- and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and a 
      Conventional CNN (CCNN). We employed a well-known public dataset of heart sound 
      signals: the Physionet heart sound. The accuracy of the PCNN, was estimated to be 
      87.2% which outperforms the rest of the three methods: the SCNN, the LSTM, and 
      the CCNN by 12%, 7%, and 0.5%, respectively. The resulting method can be easily 
      implemented in an Internet of Things platform to be employed as a decision 
      support system for the screening heart abnormalities.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely proposed for different tasks 
      of heart sound analysis. This paper presents the results of a novel study on the 
      performance of a conventional CNN in comparison to the different architectures of 
      recurrent neural networks combined with CNN for the classification task of 
      abnormal-normal heart sounds. The study considers various combinations of 
      parallel and cascaded integration of CNN with Gated Recurrent Network (GRN) as 
      well as Long- Short Term Memory (LSTM) and explores the accuracy and sensitivity 
      of each integration independently, using the Physionet dataset of heart sound 
      recordings. The accuracy of the parallel architecture of LSTM-CNN reached 98.0% 
      outperforming all the combined architectures, with a sensitivity of 87.2%. The 
      conventional CNN offered sensitivity/accuracy of 95.9%/97.3% with far less 
      complexity. Results show that a conventional CNN can appropriately perform and 
      solely employed for the classification of heart sound signals.

TI  - Detection of Snore from OSAHS Patients Based on Deep Learning.
PG  - 8864863
LID - 10.1155/2020/8864863 [doi]
LID - 8864863
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is extremely harmful to the 
      human body and may cause neurological dysfunction and endocrine dysfunction, 
      resulting in damage to multiple organs and multiple systems throughout the body 
      and negatively affecting the cardiovascular, kidney, and mental systems. 
      Clinically, doctors usually use standard PSG (Polysomnography) to assist 
      diagnosis. PSG determines whether a person has apnea syndrome with 
      multidimensional data such as brain waves, heart rate, and blood oxygen 
      saturation. In this paper, we have presented a method of recognizing OSAHS, which 
      is convenient for patients to monitor themselves in daily life to avoid delayed 
      treatment. Firstly, we theoretically analyzed the difference between the snoring 
      sounds of normal people and OSAHS patients in the time and frequency domains. 
      Secondly, the snoring sounds related to apnea events and the nonapnea related 
      snoring sounds were classified by deep learning, and then, the severity of OSAHS 
      symptoms had been recognized. In the algorithm proposed in this paper, the 
      snoring data features are extracted through the three feature extraction methods, 
      which are MFCC, LPCC, and LPMFCC. Moreover, we adopted CNN and LSTM for 
      classification. The experimental results show that the MFCC feature extraction 
      method and the LSTM model have the highest accuracy rate which was 87% when it is 
      adopted for binary-classification of snoring data. Moreover, the AHI value of the 
      patient can be obtained by the algorithm system which can determine the severity 
      degree of OSAHS.

AB  - Heart sound is one of the common medical signals for diagnosing cardiovascular 
      diseases. This paper studies the binary classification between normal or abnormal 
      heart sounds, and proposes a heart sound classification algorithm based on the 
      joint decision of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural network, 
      achieving a further improvement in feature extraction and model accuracy. First, 
      the preprocessed heart sound recordings are segmented into four status, and five 
      categories of features are extracted from the signals based on segmentation. The 
      first four categories of features are sieved through recursive feature 
      elimination, which is used as the input of the XGBoost classifier. The last 
      category is the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), which is used as the 
      input of long short-term memory network (LSTM). Considering the imbalance of the 
      data set, these two classifiers are both improved with weights. Finally, the 
      heterogeneous integrated decision method is adopted to obtain the prediction. The 
      algorithm was applied to the open heart sound database of the PhysioNet Computing 
      in Cardiology(CINC) Challenge in 2016 on the PhysioNet website, to test the 
      sensitivity, specificity, modified accuracy and F score. The results were 93%, 
      89.4%, 91.2% and 91.3% respectively. Compared with the results of machine 
      learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other methods used by other 
      researchers, the accuracy and sensibility have been obviously improved, which 
      proves that the method in this paper could effectively improve the accuracy of 
      heart sound signal classification, and has great potential in the clinical 
      auxiliary diagnosis application of some cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Segmentation of Radar-Recorded Heart Sound Signals Using Bidirectional LSTM 
      Networks.

AB  - Sounds caused by the action of the heart reflect both its health as well as 
      deficiencies and are examined by physicians since antiquity. Pathologies of the 
      valves, e.g. insufficiencies and stenosis, cardiac effusion, arrhythmia, 
      inflammation of the surrounding tissue and other diagnosis can be reached by 
      experienced physicians. However, practice is needed to assess the findings 
      correctly. Furthermore, stethoscopes do not allow for long-term monitoring of a 
      patient. Recently, radar technology has shown the ability to perform continuous 
      touchless and thereby burden-free heart sound measurements. In order to perform 
      automated classification of the signals, the first and most important step is to 
      segment the heart sounds into their physiological phases. This paper examines the 
      use of different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for this purpose 
      based on a large dataset of radar-recorded heart sounds gathered from 30 
      different test persons in a clinical study. The best-performing network, a 
      bidirectional LSTM, achieves a sample-wise accuracy of 93.4 % and a F1 score for 
      the first heart sound of 95.8 %.
