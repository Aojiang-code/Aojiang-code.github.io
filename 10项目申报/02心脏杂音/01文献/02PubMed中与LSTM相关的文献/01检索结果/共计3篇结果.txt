TI  - Classification of Heart Sounds Using Chaogram Transform and Deep Convolutional 
      Neural Network Transfer Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s22249569 [doi]
LID - 9569
AB  - Heart sounds convey important information regarding potential heart diseases. 
      Currently, heart sound classification attracts many researchers from the fields 
      of telemedicine, digital signal processing, and machine learning-among 
      others-mainly to identify cardiac pathology as quickly as possible. This article 
      proposes chaogram as a new transform to convert heart sound signals to colour 
      images. In the proposed approach, the output image is, therefore, the projection 
      of the reconstructed phase space representation of the phonocardiogram (PCG) 
      signal on three coordinate planes. This has two major benefits: (1) it makes 
      possible to apply deep convolutional neural networks to heart sounds and (2) it 
      is also possible to employ a transfer learning scheme by converting a heart sound 
      signal to an image. The performance of the proposed approach was verified on the 
      PhysioNet dataset. Due to the imbalanced data on this dataset, it is common to 
      assess the results quality using the average of sensitivity and specificity, 
      which is known as score, instead of accuracy. In this study, the best results 
      were achieved using the InceptionV3 model, which achieved a score of 88.06%.

TI  - Deep Learning Methods for Heart Sounds Classification: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/e23060667 [doi]
LID - 667
AB  - The automated classification of heart sounds plays a significant role in the 
      diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). With the recent introduction of 
      medical big data and artificial intelligence technology, there has been an 
      increased focus on the development of deep learning approaches for heart sound 
      classification. However, despite significant achievements in this field, there 
      are still limitations due to insufficient data, inefficient training, and the 
      unavailability of effective models. With the aim of improving the accuracy of 
      heart sounds classification, an in-depth systematic review and an analysis of 
      existing deep learning methods were performed in the present study, with an 
      emphasis on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network 
      (RNN) methods developed over the last five years. This paper also discusses the 
      challenges and expected future trends in the application of deep learning to 
      heart sounds classification with the objective of providing an essential 
      reference for further study.

AB  - Data labeling is often the limiting step in machine learning because it requires 
      time from trained experts. To address the limitation on labeled data, contrastive 
      learning, among other unsupervised learning methods, leverages unlabeled data to 
      learn representations of data. Here, we propose a contrastive learning framework 
      that utilizes metadata for selecting positive and negative pairs when training on 
      unlabeled data. We demonstrate its application in the healthcare domain on heart 
      and lung sound recordings. The increasing availability of heart and lung sound 
      recordings due to adoption of digital stethoscopes lends itself as an opportunity 
      to demonstrate the application of our contrastive learning method. Compared to 
      contrastive learning with augmentations, the contrastive learning model 
      leveraging metadata for pair selection utilizes clinical information associated 
      with lung and heart sound recordings. This approach uses shared context of the 
      recordings on the patient level using clinical information including age, sex, 
      weight, location of sounds, etc. We show improvement in downstream tasks for 
      diagnosing heart and lung sounds when leveraging patient-specific representations 
      in selecting positive and negative pairs. This study paves the path for medical 
      applications of contrastive learning that leverage clinical information. We have 
      made our code available here:

AB  - Background The success of cardiac auscultation varies widely among medical 
      professionals, which can lead to missed treatments for structural heart disease. 
      Applying machine learning to cardiac auscultation could address this problem, but 
      despite recent interest, few algorithms have been brought to clinical practice. 
      We evaluated a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration-cleared algorithms 
      trained via deep learning on >15 000 heart sound recordings. Methods and Results 
      We validated the algorithms on a data set of 2375 recordings from 615 unique 
      subjects. This data set was collected in real clinical environments using 
      commercially available digital stethoscopes, annotated by board-certified 
      cardiologists, and paired with echocardiograms as the gold standard. To model the 
      algorithm in clinical practice, we compared its performance against 10 clinicians 
      on a subset of the validation database. Our algorithm reliably detected 
      structural murmurs with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4%. When 
      limiting the analysis to clearly audible murmurs in adults, performance improved 
      to a sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 90.6%. The algorithm also reported 
      timing within the cardiac cycle, differentiating between systolic and diastolic 
      murmurs. Despite optimizing acoustics for the clinicians, the algorithm 
      substantially outperformed the clinicians (average clinician accuracy, 77.9%; 
      algorithm accuracy, 84.7%.) Conclusions The algorithms accurately identified 
      murmurs associated with structural heart disease. Our results illustrate a marked 
      contrast between the consistency of the algorithm and the substantial 
      interobserver variability of clinicians. Our results suggest that adopting 
      machine learning algorithms into clinical practice could improve the detection of 
      structural heart disease to facilitate patient care.

TI  - A multi-scale and multi-domain heart sound feature-based machine learning model 
      for ACC/AHA heart failure stage classification.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ac6d40 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Heart sounds can reflect detrimental changes in cardiac mechanical 
      activity that are common pathological characteristics of chronic heart failure 
      (CHF). The ACC/AHA heart failure (HF) stage classification is essential for 
      clinical decision-making and the management of CHF. Herein, a machine learning 
      model that makes use of multi-scale and multi-domain heart sound features was 
      proposed to provide an objective aid for ACC/AHA HF stage 
      classification.Approach.A dataset containing phonocardiogram (PCG) signals from 
      275 subjects was obtained from two medical institutions and used in this study. 
      Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition and tunable-Q wavelet 
      transform were used to construct self-adaptive sub-sequences and multi-level 
      sub-band signals for PCG signals. Time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear 
      feature extraction were then applied to the original PCG signal, heart sound 
      sub-sequences and sub-band signals to construct multi-scale and multi-domain 
      heart sound features. The features selected via the least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator were fed into a machine learning classifier for ACC/AHA HF 
      stage classification. Finally, mainstream machine learning classifiers, including 
      least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), deep belief network (DBN) and 
      random forest (RF), were compared to determine the optimal model.Main results. 
      The results showed that the LS-SVM, which utilized a combination of multi-scale 
      and multi-domain features, achieved better classification performance than the 
      DBN and RF using multi-scale or/and multi-domain features alone or together, with 
      average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.821, 0.955 and 0.820 on the 
      testing set, respectively.Significance.PCG signal analysis provides efficient 
      measurement information regarding CHF severity and is a promising noninvasive 
      method for ACC/AHA HF stage classification.

AB  - Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, and 
      auscultation is typically an essential part of a cardiovascular examination. The 
      ability to diagnose a patient based on their heart sounds is a rather difficult 
      skill to master. Thus, many approaches for automated heart auscultation have been 
      explored. However, most of the previously proposed methods involve a segmentation 
      step, the performance of which drops significantly for high pulse rates or noisy 
      signals. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation-free heart sound 
      classification method. Specifically, we apply discrete wavelet transform to 
      denoise the signal, followed by feature extraction and feature reduction. Then, 
      Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks are utilised for classification. 
      On the PASCAL heart sound dataset our approach showed superior performance 
      compared to others, achieving 81% and 96% precision on normal and murmur classes, 
      respectively. In addition, for the first time, the data were further explored 
      under a user-independent setting, where the proposed method achieved 92% and 86% 
      precision on normal and murmur, demonstrating the potential of enabling automatic 
      murmur detection for practical use.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases have become one of the most prevalent threats to human 
      health throughout the world. As a noninvasive assistant diagnostic tool, the 
      heart sound detection techniques play an important role in the prediction of 
      cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, the latest development of the 
      computer-aided heart sound detection techniques over the last five years has been 
      reviewed. There are mainly the following aspects: the theories of heart sounds 
      and the relationship between heart sounds and cardiovascular diseases; the key 
      technologies used in the processing and analysis of heart sound signals, 
      including denoising, segmentation, feature extraction and classification; with 
      emphasis, the applications of deep learning algorithm in heart sound processing. 
      In the end, some areas for future research in computer-aided heart sound 
      detection techniques are explored, hoping to provide reference to the prediction 
      of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - This paper presents a heart murmur detection and multi-class classification 
      approach via machine learning. We extracted heart sound and murmur features that 
      are of diagnostic importance and developed additional 16 features that are not 
      perceivable by human ears but are valuable to improve murmur classification 
      accuracy. We examined and compared the classification performance of supervised 
      machine learning with k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) 
      algorithms. We put together a test repertoire having more than 450 heart sound 
      and murmur episodes to evaluate the performance of murmur classification using 
      cross-validation of 80-20 and 90-10 splits. As clearly demonstrated in our 
      evaluation, the specific set of features chosen in our study resulted in accurate 
      classification consistently exceeding 90% for both classifiers.

      and deep learning.

AB  - Heart diseases represent a serious medical condition that can be fatal. 
      Therefore, it is critical to investigate the measures of its early prevention. 
      The Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) feature has been widely used 
      in the early diagnosis of heart abnormity and achieved promising results. During 
      feature extraction, the Mel-scale triangular overlapping filter set is applied, 
      which makes the frequency response more in line with the human auditory property. 
      However, the frequency of the heart sound signals has no specific relationship 
      with the human auditory system, which may not be suitable for processing of heart 
      sound signals. To overcome this issue and obtain a more objective feature that 
      can better adapt to practical use, in this work, we propose an equal scale 
      frequency cepstral coefficients (EFCC) feature based on replacing the Mel-scale 
      filter set with a set of equally spaced triangular overlapping filters. We 
      further designed classifiers combining convolutional neural network (CNN), 
      recurrent neural network (RNN) and random forest (RF) layers, which can extract 
      both the spatial and temporal information of the input features. We evaluated the 
      proposed algorithm on our database and the PhysioNet Computational Cardiology 
      (CinC) 2016 Challenge Database. Results from ten-fold cross-validation reveal 
      that the EFCC-based features show considerably better performance and robustness 
      than the MFCC-based features on the task of classifying heart sounds from novel 
      patients. Our algorithm can be further used in wearable medical devices to 
      monitor the heart status of patients in real time with high precision, which is 
      of great clinical importance.

TI  - Cutting Weights of Deep Learning Models for Heart Sound Classification: 
      Introducing a Knowledge Distillation Approach.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340704 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death worldwide. In 
      recent years, intelligent auxiliary diagnosis of CVDs based on computer audition 
      has become a popular research field, and intelligent diagnosis technology is 
      increasingly mature. Neural networks used to monitor CVDs are becoming more 
      complex, requiring more computing power and memory, and are difficult to deploy 
      in wearable devices. This paper proposes a lightweight model for classifying 
      heart sounds based on knowledge distillation, which can be deployed in wearable 
      devices to monitor the heart sounds of wearers. The network model is designed 
      based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Model performance is evaluated by 
      extracting Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features from the 
      PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 dataset. The experimental results show that 
      knowledge distillation can improve a lightweight network's accuracy, and our 
      model performs well on the test set. Especially, when the knowledge distillation 
      temperature is 7 and the weight α is 0.1, the accuracy is 88.5 %, the recall is 
      83.8 %, and the specificity is 93.6 %.Clinical relevance- A lightweight model of 
      heart sound classification based on knowledge distillation can be deployed on 
      various hardware devices for timely monitoring and feedback of the physical 
      condition of patients with CVDs for timely provision of medical advice. When the 
      model is deployed on the medical instruments of the hospital, the condition of 
      severe and hospitalised patients can be timely fed back and clinical treatment 
      advice can be provided to the clinicians.

LID - 10.1017/S1047951121004212 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning uses historical data to make predictions about new data. It has 
      been frequently applied in healthcare to optimise diagnostic classification 
      through discovery of hidden patterns in data that may not be obvious to 
      clinicians. Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) machine learning research entails one 
      of the most promising clinical applications, in which timely and accurate 
      diagnosis is essential. The objective of this scoping review is to summarise the 
      application and clinical utility of machine learning techniques used in 
      paediatric cardiology research, specifically focusing on approaches aiming to 
      optimise diagnosis and assessment of underlying CHD. Out of 50 full-text articles 
      identified between 2015 and 2021, 40% focused on optimising the diagnosis and 
      assessment of CHD. Deep learning and support vector machine were the most 
      commonly used algorithms, accounting for an overall diagnostic accuracy > 0.80. 
      Clinical applications primarily focused on the classification of auscultatory 
      heart sounds, transthoracic echocardiograms, and cardiac MRIs. The range of these 
      applications and directions of future research are discussed in this scoping 
      review.

      screening models were constructed to identify 884 heart sound recordings from 
      children with left-to-right shunt CHD. The most suitable model for each type was 
      summarized and compared with expert auscultation. An exploratory analysis was 
      conducted to assess whether there were correlations between heart sounds and left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), pulmonary artery pressure, and malformation 
      size. RESULTS: The residual convolution recurrent neural network (RCRnet) 
      classification model had higher accuracy than other models with respect to atrial 
      septal defect (ASD), ventricular septum defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus 
      (PDA) and combined CHD, and the best auscultation sites were determined to be the 
      4th, 5th, 2nd and 3rd auscultation areas, respectively. The diagnostic results of 
      this model were better than those derived from expert auscultation, with 
      sensitivity values of 0.932-1.000, specificity values of 0.944-0.997, precision 
      values of 0.888-0.997 and accuracy values of 0.940-0.994. Absolute Pearson 
      correlation coefficient values between heart sounds of the four types of CHD and 
      LVEF, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and malformation size were all 
      less than 0.3. CONCLUSIONS: The RCRnet model can preliminarily determine types of 
      left-to-right shunt CHD and improve diagnostic efficiency, which may provide a 
      new choice algorithmic CHD screening in children.

AB  - Cardiac auscultation is a noninvasive, convenient, and low-cost diagnostic method 
      for heart valvular disease, and it can diagnose the abnormality of the heart 
      valve at an early stage. However, the accuracy of auscultation relies on the 
      professionalism of cardiologists. Doctors in remote areas may lack the experience 
      to diagnose correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system to assist 
      with the diagnosis. This study proposed a computer-aided heart valve disease 
      diagnosis system, including a heart sound acquisition module, a trained model for 
      diagnosis, and software, which can diagnose four kinds of heart valve diseases. 
      In this study, a training dataset containing five categories of heart sounds was 
      collected, including normal, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and aortic 
      stenosis heart sound. A convolutional neural network GoogLeNet and weighted KNN 
      are used to train the models separately. For the model trained by the 
      convolutional neural network, time series heart sound signals are converted into 
      time-frequency scalograms based on continuous wavelet transform to adapt to the 
      architecture of GoogLeNet. For the model trained by weighted KNN, features from 
      the time domain and time-frequency domain are extracted manually. Then feature 
      selection based on the chi-square test is performed to get a better group of 
      features. Moreover, we designed software that lets doctors upload heart sounds, 
      visualize the heart sound waveform, and use the model to get the diagnosis. Model 
      assessments using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score indicators are 
      done on two trained models. The results showed that the model trained by modified 
      GoogLeNet outperformed others, with an overall accuracy of 97.5%. The average 
      accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score for diagnosing four kinds of 
      heart valve diseases are 98.75%, 96.88%, 99.22%, and 97.99%, respectively. The 
      computer-aided diagnosis system, with a heart sound acquisition module, a 
      diagnostic model, and software, can visualize the heart sound waveform and show 
      the reference diagnostic results. This can assist in the diagnosis of heart valve 
      diseases, especially in remote areas, which lack skilled doctors.

TI  - The Effect of Signal Duration on the Classification of Heart Sounds: A Deep 
      Learning Approach.
LID - 10.3390/s22062261 [doi]
LID - 2261
AB  - Deep learning techniques are the future trend for designing heart sound 
      classification methods, making conventional heart sound segmentation dispensable. 
      However, despite using fixed signal duration for training, no study has assessed 
      its effect on the final performance in detail. Therefore, this study aims at 
      analysing the duration effect on the commonly used deep learning methods to 
      provide insight for future studies in data processing, classifier, and feature 
      selection. The results of this study revealed that (1) very short heart sound 
      signal duration (1 s) weakens the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks 
      (RNNs), whereas no apparent decrease in the tested Convolutional Neural Network 
      (CNN) model was found. (2) RNN outperformed CNN using Mel-frequency cepstrum 
      coefficients (MFCCs) as features. There was no difference between RNN models 
      (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, or BiGRU). (3) Adding dynamic information (∆ and ∆²MFCCs) of 
      the heart sound as a feature did not improve the RNNs' performance, and the 
      improvement on CNN was also minimal (≤2.5% in MAcc). The findings provided a 
      theoretical basis for further heart sound classification using deep learning 
      techniques when selecting the input length.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Heart Sound Analysis for Left Ventricular Diastolic 
      Dysfunction Diagnosis.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11122349 [doi]
LID - 2349
AB  - The aggravation of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) could lead to 
      ventricular remodeling, wall stiffness, reduced compliance, and progression to 
      heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. A non-invasive method based on 
      convolutional neural networks (CNN) and heart sounds (HS) is presented for the 
      early diagnosis of LVDD in this paper. A deep convolutional generative 
      adversarial networks (DCGAN) model-based data augmentation (DA) method was 
      proposed to expand a HS database of LVDD for model training. Firstly, the 
      preprocessing of HS signals was performed using the improved wavelet denoising 
      method. Secondly, the logistic regression based hidden semi-Markov model was 
      utilized to segment HS signals, which were subsequently converted into 
      spectrograms for DA using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Finally, the 
      proposed method was compared with VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, 
      DenseNet-121, and AlexNet in terms of performance for LVDD diagnosis. The result 
      shows that the proposed method has a reasonable performance with an accuracy of 
      0.987, a sensitivity of 0.986, and a specificity of 0.988, which proves the 
      effectiveness of HS analysis for the early diagnosis of LVDD and demonstrates 
      that the DCGAN-based DA method could effectively augment HS data.

AB  - Intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can enhance the diagnostic 
      capabilities of physicians and reduce the time required for accurate diagnosis. 
      CAD systems could provide physicians with a suggestion about the diagnostic of 
      heart diseases. The objective of this paper is to review the recent published 
      preprocessing, feature extraction and classification techniques and their state 
      of the art of phonocardiogram (PCG) signal analysis. Published literature 
      reviewed in this paper shows the potential of machine learning techniques as a 
      design tool in PCG CAD systems and reveals that the CAD systems for PCG signal 
      analysis are still an open problem. Related studies are compared to their 
      datasets, feature extraction techniques and the classifiers they used. Current 
      achievements and limitations in developing CAD systems for PCG signal analysis 
      using machine learning techniques are presented and discussed. In the light of 
      this review, a number of future research directions for PCG signal analysis are 
      provided.

AB  - Lung or heart sound classification is challenging due to the complex nature of 
      audio data, its dynamic properties of time, and frequency domains. It is also 
      very difficult to detect lung or heart conditions with small amounts of data or 
      unbalanced and high noise in data. Furthermore, the quality of data is a 
      considerable pitfall for improving the performance of deep learning. In this 
      paper, we propose a novel feature-based fusion network called FDC-FS for 
      classifying heart and lung sounds. The FDC-FS framework aims to effectively 
      transfer learning from three different deep neural network models built from 
      audio datasets. The innovation of the proposed transfer learning relies on the 
      transformation from audio data to image vectors and from three specific models to 
      one fused model that would be more suitable for deep learning. We used two 
      publicly available datasets for this study, i.e., lung sound data from ICHBI 2017 
      challenge and heart challenge data. We applied data augmentation techniques, such 
      as noise distortion, pitch shift, and time stretching, dealing with some data 
      issues in these datasets. Importantly, we extracted three unique features from 
      the audio samples, i.e., Spectrogram, MFCC, and Chromagram. Finally, we built a 
      fusion of three optimal convolutional neural network models by feeding the image 
      feature vectors transformed from audio features. We confirmed the superiority of 
      the proposed fusion model compared to the state-of-the-art works. The highest 
      accuracy we achieved with FDC-FS is 99.1% with Spectrogram-based lung sound 
      classification while 97% for Spectrogram and Chromagram based heart sound 
      classification.

AB  - Cardiac auscultation is one of the most conventional approaches for the initial 
      assessment of heart disease, however the technique is highly user-dependent and 
      with low repeatability. Several computational approaches based on the analysis of 
      the phonocardiograms (PCG) have been proposed to classify heart sounds into 
      normal or abnormal, but most often do not achieve acceptable levels of 
      sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) or require the use of special hardware. We 
      propose a novel approach for classification of PCG. First, the system makes use 
      of deep neural networks for computing individual cardiac cycle probabilities, 
      followed by classification using weighted probability comparisons. The system was 
      tested on an extended dataset consisting of a balanced sample of 18179 normal and 
      abnormal cycles, achieving Se and Sp values of 91.3% and 93.8% respectively. In 
      addition, the system overcomes previous limitations since it was trained with a 
      balanced sample; also, the decision factor used during the classification stage 
      allows to control the trade-off between Se and Sp, making the proposed system 
      suitable for clinical applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous optimization of atrioventricular (AV) delay for cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) is mainly performed by electrical means. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop an estimation model of 
      cardiac function that uses a piezoelectric microphone embedded in a pulse 
      generator to guide CRT optimization. METHODS: Electrocardiogram, left ventricular 
      pressure (LVP), and heart sounds were simultaneously collected during CRT device 
      implantation procedures. A piezoelectric alarm transducer embedded in a modified 
      CRT device facilitated recording of heart sounds in patients undergoing a pacing 
      protocol with different AV delays. Machine learning (ML) was used to produce a 
      decision-tree ensemble model capable of estimating absolute maximal LVP 
      (LVP(max)) and maximal rise of LVP (LVdP/dt(max)) using 3 heart sound-based 
      features. To gauge the applicability of ML in AV delay optimization, polynomial 
      curves were fitted to measured and estimated values. RESULTS: In the data set of 
      ∼30,000 heartbeats, ML indicated S1 amplitude, S2 amplitude, and S1 integral (S1 
      energy for LVdP/dt(max)) as most prominent features for AV delay optimization. ML 
      resulted in single-beat estimation precision for absolute values of LVP(max) and 
      LVdP/dt(max) of 67% and 64%, respectively. For 20-30 beat averages, 
      cross-correlation between measured and estimated LVP(max) and LVdP/dt(max) was 
      0.999 for both. The estimated optimal AV delays were not significantly different 
      from those measured using invasive LVP (difference -5.6 ± 17.1 ms for LVP(max) 
      and +5.1 ± 6.7 ms for LVdP/dt(max)). The difference in function at estimated and 
      measured optimal AV delays was not statiscally significant (1 ± 3 mm Hg for 
      LVP(max) and 9 ± 57 mm Hg/s for LVdP/dt(max)). CONCLUSION: Heart sound sensors 
      embedded in a CRT device, powered by a ML algorithm, provide a reliable 
      assessment of optimal AV delays and absolute LVP(max) and LVdP/dt(max).

AB  - Cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are fatal factors that threaten human 
      health and cause many deaths worldwide each year, so it is essential to screen 
      cardiopulmonary disease more accurately and efficiently. Auscultation is a 
      non-invasive method for physicians' perception of the disease. The Heart Sounds 
      (HS) and Lung Sounds (LS) recorded by an electronic stethoscope consist of 
      acoustic information that is helpful in the diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. 
      Still, inter-interference between HS and LS presented in both the time and 
      frequency domains blocks diagnostic efficiency. This paper proposes a blind 
      source separation （BSS）strategy that first classifies Heart-Lung-Sound (HLS) 
      according to its LS features and then separates it into HS and LS. Sparse 
      Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) is employed to extract the LS features 
      in HLS, then proposed a network constructed by Dilated Convolutional Neural 
      Network (DCNN) to classify HLS into five types by the magnitude features of LS. 
      Finally, Multi-Channel UNet (MCUNet) separation model is utilized for each 
      category of HLS. This paper is the first to propose the HLS classification method 
      SNMF-DCNN and apply UNet to the cardiopulmonary sound separation domain. Compared 
      with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed framework in this paper has 
      higher separation quality and robustness.

AB  - Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a cardiovascular disorder caused 
      by structural defects in the heart. Early screening holds significant importance 
      for the effective treatment of this condition. Heart sound analysis is commonly 
      employed to assist in the diagnosis of CHD. However, there is currently a lack of 
      an efficient automated model for heart sound classification, which could 
      potentially replace the manual process of auscultation. Methods: This study 
      introduces an innovative and efficient screening and classification model, 
      combining a locally concatenated fusion approach with a convolutional neural 
      network based on coordinate attention (LCACNN). In this model, Mel-frequency 
      spectral coefficients (MFSC) and envelope features are locally fused and employed 
      as input to the LCACNN network. This model automatically analyzes feature map 
      energy information, eliminating the need for denoising processes. Discussion: The 
      proposed classification model in this study demonstrates a robust capability for 
      identifying congenital heart disease, potentially substituting manual 
      auscultation to facilitate the detection of patients in remote areas. Results: 
      This study introduces an innovative and efficient screening and classification 
      model, combining a locally concatenated fusion approach with a convolutional 
      neural network based on coordinate attention (LCACNN). In this model,

      fused and employed as input to the LCACNN network. This model automatically 
      analyzes feature map energy information, eliminating the need for denoising 
      processes. To assess the performance of the classification model, comparative 
      ablation experiments were conducted, achieving classification accuracies of 
      91.78% and 94.79% on the PhysioNet and HS databases, respectively. These results 
      significantly outperformed alternative classification models.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that cardiovascular diseases 
      (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death globally, with an estimated rise to 
      over 23.6 million deaths by 2030. This alarming trend can be attributed to our 
      unhealthy lifestyles and lack of attention towards early CVD diagnosis. 
      Traditional cardiac auscultation, where a highly qualified cardiologist listens 
      to the heart sounds, is a crucial diagnostic method, but not always feasible or 
      affordable. Therefore, developing accessible and user-friendly CVD recognition 
      solutions can encourage individuals to integrate regular heart screenings into 
      their routine. Although many automatic CVD screening methods have been proposed, 
      most of them rely on complex prepocessing steps and heart cycle segmentation 
      processes. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for 
      recognizing normal and abnormal PCG signals using Physionet data. We employ data 
      selection techniques such as kernel density estimation (KDE) for signal duration 
      extraction, signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and GMM clustering to improve the 
      performance of 17 pretrained Keras CNN models. Our results indicate that using 
      KDE to select the appropriate signal duration and fine-tuning the VGG19 model 
      results in excellent classification performance with an overall accuracy of 0.97, 
      sensitivity of 0.946, precision of 0.944, and specificity of 0.946.

TI  - Heart Murmur Classification Using a Capsule Neural Network.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10111237 [doi]
LID - 1237
AB  - The healthcare industry has made significant progress in the diagnosis of heart 
      conditions due to the use of intelligent detection systems such as 
      electrocardiograms, cardiac ultrasounds, and abnormal sound diagnostics that use 
      artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as convolutional neural networks 
      (CNNs). Over the past few decades, methods for automated segmentation and 
      classification of heart sounds have been widely studied. In many cases, both 
      experimental and clinical data require electrocardiography (ECG)-labeled 
      phonocardiograms (PCGs) or several feature extraction techniques from the 
      mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) spectrum of heart sounds to 
      achieve better identification results with AI methods. Without good feature 
      extraction techniques, the CNN may face challenges in classifying the MFCC 
      spectrum of heart sounds. To overcome these limitations, we propose a capsule 
      neural network (CapsNet), which can utilize iterative dynamic routing methods to 
      obtain good combinations for layers in the translational equivariance of MFCC 
      spectrum features, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of heart murmur 
      classification. The 2016 PhysioNet heart sound database was used for training and 
      validating the prediction performance of CapsNet and other CNNs. Then, we 
      collected our own dataset of clinical auscultation scenarios for fine-tuning 
      hyperparameters and testing results. CapsNet demonstrated its feasibility by 
      achieving validation accuracies of 90.29% and 91.67% on the test dataset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heart abnormality detection using heart sound signals (phonocardiogram 
      (PCG)) has been an active research area for the last few decades. In this paper, 
      automatic heart sound classification using segmented and unsegmented PCG signals 
      is presented. APPROACH: In this paper: (i) we perform an in-depth analysis of 
      various time and frequency domain features, followed by experimental 
      determination of effective feature subsets for improved classification 
      performance; (ii) both segmented and unsegmented PCG signals are studied and 
      important results concerning the respective feature subsets and their 
      classification performances are reported; and (iii) different classification 
      algorithms, including the support vector machine, kth nearest neighbor, decision 
      tree, ensemble classifier, artificial neural network and long short-term memory 
      network (LSTMs), are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed feature 
      subsets and their comparison with other established features and methods is 
      presented. MAIN RESULTS: It is observed that LSTM performs better on 
      mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features extracted from unsegmented PCG 
      data, with an area under curve (AUC) score of 91.39%, however, the MFCC features 
      do not show a consistent performance with other classifiers (the second highest 
      AUC score is 62.08% with the decision tree classifier). In contrast, in the case 
      of time-frequency features from segmented data, the performance of all the 
      classifiers is appreciable with AUC scores over 70%. In particular, the 
      conventional machine learning techniques shows consistency in achieving over 80% 
      in AUC scores. Significanc e: The results of this study highlight the importance 
      of time and frequency domain features. Thus it is necessary to employ both the 
      time and frequency features of segmented PCG signals to achieve improved 
      classification.

AB  - Heart sound classification plays a vital role in the early detection of 
      cardiovascular disorders, especially for small primary health care clinics. 
      Despite that much progress has been made for heart sound classification in recent 
      years, most of them are based on conventional segmented features and shallow 
      structure based classifiers. These conventional acoustic representation and 
      classification methods may be insufficient in characterizing heart sound, and 
      generally suffer from a degraded performance due to the complicated and 
      changeable cardiac acoustic environment. In this paper, we propose a new heart 
      sound classification method based on improved Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient 
      (MFCC) features and convolutional recurrent neural networks. The Mel-frequency 
      cepstrums are firstly calculated without dividing the heart sound signal. A new 
      improved feature extraction scheme based on MFCC is proposed to elaborate the 
      dynamic characteristics among consecutive heart sound signals. Finally, the 
      MFCC-based features are fed to a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network 
      (CRNN) for feature learning and later classification task. The proposed deep 
      learning framework can take advantage of the encoded local characteristics 
      extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long-term 
      dependencies captured by the recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive 
      studies on the performance of different network parameters and different network 
      connection strategies are presented in this paper. Performance comparisons with 
      state-of-the-art algorithms are given for discussions. Experiments show that, for 
      the two-class classification problem (pathological or non-pathological), a 
      classification accuracy of 98% has been achieved on the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge database.

AB  - In this study, we constructed a model to predict abnormal cardiac sounds using a 
      diverse set of auscultation data collected from various auscultation positions. 
      Abnormal heart sounds were identified by extracting features such as peak 
      intervals and noise characteristics during systole and diastole. Instead of using 
      raw signal data, we transformed them into log-mel 2D spectrograms, which were 
      employed as input variables for the CNN model. The advancement of our model 
      involves integrating a deep learning architecture with feature extraction 
      techniques based on existing knowledge of cardiac data. Specifically, we propose 
      a multi-channel-based heart signal processing (MCHeart) scheme, which 
      incorporates our proposed features into the deep learning model. Additionally, we 
      introduce the ReLCNN model by applying residual blocks and MHA mechanisms to the 
      LCNN architecture. By adding murmur features with a smoothing function and 
      training the ReLCNN model, the weighted accuracy of the model increased from 
      79.6% to 83.6%, showing a performance improvement of approximately 4% point 
      compared to the LCNN baseline model.

AB  - The most common clinical sign in pediatric cardiology is heart murmur, which can 
      often be uncharacteristic. The aim of this research was to present the results of 
      development of a classifier based on machine learning algorithms whose purpose is 
      to classify organic murmur that occur in congenital heart defect (CHD). The study 
      is based on the data collected at Pediatric Clinic, Clinical Center University of 
      Sarajevo during three-year period. Totally, 116 children aged from 1 to 15 years 
      were enrolled in the study. Input parameters for classification are parameters 
      obtained during basic physical examination and assessment of patient. First, 
      analysis of relevance of the feature for classification was done using InfoGain, 
      GainRatio, Relief and Correlation method. In the second step, classifiers based 
      on Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support 
      Vector Machine were developed and compared by performance. The results of this 
      research suggest that high accuracy (>90%) classifier for detection of CHD based 
      on 16 parameters can be developed. Such classifier with appropriate user 
      interface would be valuable diagnostic aid to doctors and pediatricians at 
      primary healthcare level for diagnostic of heart murmurs.

AB  - Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to facilitate an automatic 
      analysis and monitoring of heart sounds has increasingly attracted tremendous 
      efforts in the past decade. Nevertheless, lacking on standard open-access 
      database made it difficult to maintain a sustainable and comparable research 
      before the first release of the PhysioNet CinC Challenge Dataset. However, 
      inconsistent standards on data collection, annotation, and partition are still 
      restraining a fair and efficient comparison between different works. To this 
      line, we introduced and benchmarked a first version of the Heart Sounds Shenzhen 
      (HSS) corpus. Motivated and inspired by the previous works based on HSS, we 
      redefined the tasks and make a comprehensive investigation on shallow and deep 
      models in this study. First, we segmented the heart sound recording into shorter 
      recordings (10 s), which makes it more similar to the human auscultation case. 
      Second, we redefined the classification tasks. Besides using the 3 class 
      categories (normal, moderate, and mild/severe) adopted in HSS, we added a binary 
      classification task in this study, i.e., normal and abnormal. In this work, we 
      provided detailed benchmarks based on both the classic machine learning and the 
      state-of-the-art deep learning technologies, which are reproducible by using 
      open-source toolkits. Last but not least, we analyzed the feature contributions 
      of best performance achieved by the benchmark to make the results more convincing 
      and interpretable.

AB  - Heart auscultation is an inexpensive and fundamental technique to effectively to 
      diagnose cardiovascular disease. However, due to relatively high human error 
      rates even when auscultation is performed by an experienced physician, and due to 
      the not universal availability of qualified personnel e.g. in developing 
      countries, a large body of research is attempting to develop automated, 
      computational tools for detecting abnormalities in heart sounds. The large 
      heterogeneity of achievable data quality and devices, the variety o possible 
      heart pathologies, and a generally poor signal-to-noise ratio make this problem 
      extremely challenging. We present an accurate classification strategy for 
      diagnosing heart sounds based on 1) automatic heart phase segmentation, 2) 
      state-of-the art filters drawn from the filed of speech synthesis (mel-frequency 
      cepstral representation), and 3) an ad-hoc multi-branch, multi-instance 
      artificial neural network based on convolutional layers and fully connected 
      neuronal ensembles which separately learns from each heart phase, hence 
      leveraging their different physiological significance. We demonstrate that it is 
      possible to train our architecture to reach very high performances, e.g. an AUC 
      of 0.87 or a sensitivity of 0.97. Our machine-learning-based tool could be 
      employed for heart sound classification, especially as a screening tool in a 
      variety of situations including telemedicine applications.

TI  - Automated heart sound classification system from unsegmented phonocardiogram 
      (PCG) using deep neural network.
PG  - 505-515
LID - 10.1007/s13246-020-00851-w [doi]
AB  - Given the patient to doctor ratio of 50,000:1 in low income and middle-income 
      countries, there is a need for automated heart sound classification system that 
      can screen the Phonocardiogram (PCG) records in real-time. This paper proposes 
      deep neural network architectures such as a one-dimensional convolutional neural 
      network (1D-CNN) and Feed-forward Neural Network (F-NN) for the classification of 
      unsegmented phonocardiogram (PCG) signal. The research paper aims to automate the 
      feature engineering and feature selection process used in the analysis of the PCG 
      signal. The original PCG signal is down-sampled at 500 Hz. Then they are divided 
      into smaller time segments of 6 s epochs. Savitzky-Golay filter is used to 
      suppress the high-frequency noises in the signal by data point smoothening. The 
      processed data was then provided as an input to the proposed deep neural network 
      (DNN) architectures. 1081 PCG records were used for training and validating the 
      proposed DNN models. The Feed-forward Neural Network model with five hidden 
      layers provided a better overall accuracy of 0.8565 with a sensitivity of 0.8673, 
      and specificity of 0.8475. The balanced accuracy of the model was found to be 
      0.8574. The performance of the model was also studied using the Receiver 
      Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot, which produced an Area Under the Curve (AUC) 
      value of 0.857. The classification accuracy of the proposed models was compared 
      to the related works on PCG signal analysis for cardiovascular disease detection. 
      The DNN models studied in this study provided comparable performance in heart 
      sound classification without the requirement of feature engineering and 
      segmentation of heart sound signals.

TI  - Blind Monaural Source Separation on Heart and Lung Sounds Based on Periodic-Coded 
      Deep Autoencoder.
PG  - 3203-3214
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3016831 [doi]
AB  - Auscultation is the most efficient way to diagnose cardiovascular and respiratory 
      diseases. To reach accurate diagnoses, a device must be able to recognize heart 
      and lung sounds from various clinical situations. However, the recorded chest 
      sounds are mixed by heart and lung sounds. Thus, effectively separating these two 
      sounds is critical in the pre-processing stage. Recent advances in machine 
      learning have progressed on monaural source separations, but most of the 
      well-known techniques require paired mixed sounds and individual pure sounds for 
      model training. As the preparation of pure heart and lung sounds is difficult, 
      special designs must be considered to derive effective heart and lung sound 
      separation techniques. In this study, we proposed a novel periodicity-coded deep 
      auto-encoder (PC-DAE) approach to separate mixed heart-lung sounds in an 
      unsupervised manner via the assumption of different periodicities between heart 
      rate and respiration rate. The PC-DAE benefits from deep-learning-based models by 
      extracting representative features and considers the periodicity of heart and 
      lung sounds to carry out the separation. We evaluated PC-DAE on two datasets. The 
      first one includes sounds from the Student Auscultation Manikin (SAM), and the 
      second is prepared by recording chest sounds in real-world conditions. 
      Experimental results indicate that PC-DAE outperforms several well-known 
      separation works in terms of standardized evaluation metrics. Moreover, waveforms 
      and spectrograms demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-DAE compared to existing 
      approaches. It is also confirmed that by using the proposed PC-DAE as a 
      pre-processing stage, the heart sound recognition accuracies can be notably 
      boosted. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of PC-DAE and its 
      potential to be used in clinical applications.

AB  - Given the world-wide prevalence of heart disease, the robust and automatic 
      detection of abnormal heart sounds could have profound effects on patient care 
      and outcomes. In this regard, a comparison of conventional and state-of-theart 
      deep learning based computer audition paradigms for the audio classification task 
      of normal, mild abnormalities, and moderate/severe abnormalities as present in 
      phonocardiogram recordings, is presented herein. In particular, we explore the 
      suitability of deep feature representations as learnt by sequence to sequence 
      autoencoders based on the auDeep toolkit. Key results, gained on the new Heart 
      Sounds Shenzhen corpus, indicate that a fused combination of deep unsupervised 
      features is well suited to the three-way classification problem, achieving our 
      highest unweighted average recall of 47.9% on the test partition.

AB  - Left ventricular diastolic dyfunction detection is particularly important in 
      cardiac function screening. This paper proposed a phonocardiogram (PCG) transfer 
      learning-based CatBoost model to detect diastolic dysfunction noninvasively. The 
      Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), 
      S-transform and gammatonegram were utilized to perform four different 
      representations of spectrograms for learning the representative patterns of PCG 
      signals in two-dimensional image modality. Then, four pre-trained convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, Xception, ResNet50 and InceptionResNetv2 
      were employed to extract multiple domain-specific deep features from PCG 
      spectrograms using transfer learning, respectively. Further, principal component 
      analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to different feature 
      subsets, respectively, and then these different selected features are fused and 
      fed into CatBoost for classification and performance comparison. Finally, three 
      typical machine learning classifiers such as multilayer perceptron, support 
      vector machine and random forest were employed to compared with CatBoost. The 
      hyperparameter optimization of the investigated models was determined through 
      grid search. The visualized result of the global feature importance showed that 
      deep features extracted from gammatonegram by ResNet50 contributed most to 
      classification. Overall, the proposed multiple domain-specific feature fusion 
      based CatBoost model with LDA achieved the best performance with an area under 
      the curve of 0.911, accuracy of 0.882, sensitivity of 0.821, specificity of 
      0.927, F1-score of 0.892 on the testing set. The PCG transfer learning-based 
      model developed in this study could aid in diastolic dysfunction detection and 
      could contribute to non-invasive evaluation of diastolic function.

TI  - Automatic Evaluation of Heart Condition According to the Sounds Emitted and 
      Implementing Six Classification Methods.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9030317 [doi]
LID - 317
AB  - The main cause of death in Mexico and the world is heart disease, and it will 
      continue to lead the death rate in the next decade according to data from the 
      World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Statistics and 
      Geography (INEGI). Therefore, the objective of this work is to implement, compare 
      and evaluate machine learning algorithms that are capable of classifying normal 
      and abnormal heart sounds. Three different sounds were analyzed in this study; 
      normal heart sounds, heart murmur sounds and extra systolic sounds, which were 
      labeled as healthy sounds (normal sounds) and unhealthy sounds (murmur and extra 
      systolic sounds). From these sounds, fifty-two features were calculated to create 
      a numerical dataset; thirty-six statistical features, eight Linear Predictive 
      Coding (LPC) coefficients and eight Cepstral Frequency-Mel Coefficients (MFCC). 
      From this dataset two more were created; one normalized and one standardized. 
      These datasets were analyzed with six classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive 
      Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Artificial 
      Neural Networks, all of them were evaluated with six metrics: accuracy, 
      specificity, sensitivity, ROC curve, precision and F1-score, respectively. The 
      performances of all the models were statistically significant, but the models 
      that performed best for this problem were logistic regression for the 
      standardized data set, with a specificity of 0.7500 and a ROC curve of 0.8405, 
      logistic regression for the normalized data set, with a specificity of 0.7083 and 
      a ROC curve of 0.8407, and Support Vector Machine with a lineal kernel for the 
      non-normalized data; with a specificity of 0.6842 and a ROC curve of 0.7703. Both 
      of these metrics are of utmost importance in evaluating the performance of 
      computer-assisted diagnostic systems.

TI  - A Robust Interpretable Deep Learning Classifier for Heart Anomaly Detection 
      Without Segmentation.

AB  - Traditionally, abnormal heart sound classification is framed as a three-stage 
      process. The first stage involves segmenting the phonocardiogram to detect 
      fundamental heart sounds; after which features are extracted and classification 
      is performed. Some researchers in the field argue the segmentation step is an 
      unwanted computational burden, whereas others embrace it as a prior step to 
      feature extraction. When comparing accuracies achieved by studies that have 
      segmented heart sounds before analysis with those who have overlooked that step, 
      the question of whether to segment heart sounds before feature extraction is 
      still open. In this study, we explicitly examine the importance of heart sound 
      segmentation as a prior step for heart sound classification, and then seek to 
      apply the obtained insights to propose a robust classifier for abnormal heart 
      sound detection. Furthermore, recognizing the pressing need for explainable 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the medical domain, we also unveil hidden 
      representations learned by the classifier using model interpretation techniques. 
      Experimental results demonstrate that the segmentation which can be learned by 
      the model plays an essential role in abnormal heart sound classification. Our new 
      classifier is also shown to be robust, stable and most importantly, explainable, 
      with an accuracy of almost 100% on the widely used PhysioNet dataset.

TI  - Neonatal Heart and Lung Sound Quality Assessment for Robust Heart and Breathing 
      Rate Estimation for Telehealth Applications.

LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3047602 [doi]
AB  - With advances in digital stethoscopes, internet of things, signal processing and 
      machine learning, chest sounds can be easily collected and transmitted to the 
      cloud for remote monitoring and diagnosis. However, low quality of recordings 
      complicates remote monitoring and diagnosis, particularly for neonatal care. This 
      paper proposes a new method to objectively and automatically assess the signal 
      quality to improve the accuracy and reliability of heart rate (HR) and breathing 
      rate (BR) estimation from noisy neonatal chest sounds. A total of 88 10-second 
      long chest sounds were taken from 76 preterm and full-term babies. Six annotators 
      independently assessed the signal quality, number of detectable beats, and 
      breathing periods from these recordings. For quality classification, 187 and 182 
      features were extracted from heart and lung sounds, respectively. After feature 
      selection, class balancing, and hyperparameter optimization, a dynamic binary 
      classification model was trained. Then HR and BR were automatically estimated 
      from the chest sound and several approaches were compared.The results of 
      subject-wise leave-one-out cross-validation, showed that the model distinguished 
      high and low quality recordings in the test set with 96% specificity, 81% 
      sensitivity and 93% accuracy for heart sounds, and 86% specificity, 69% 
      sensitivity and 82% accuracy for lung sounds. The HR and BR estimated from high 
      quality sounds resulted in significantly less median absolute error (4 bpm and 12 
      bpm difference, respectively) compared to those from low quality sounds. The 
      methods presented in this work, facilitates automated neonatal chest sound 
      auscultation for future telehealth applications.

TI  - Deep Time Growing Neural Network vs Convolutional Neural Network for Intelligent 
      Phonocardiography.
PG  - 491-494
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220772 [doi]
AB  - This paper explores the capabilities of a sophisticated deep learning method, 
      named Deep Time Growing Neural Network (DTGNN), and compares its possibilities 
      against a generally well-known method, Convolutional Neural network (CNN). The 
      comparison is performed by using time series of the heart sound signal, so-called 
      Phonocardiography (PCG). The classification objective is to discriminate between 
      healthy and patients with cardiac diseases by applying a deep machine learning 
      method to PCGs. This approach which is called intelligent phonocardiography has 
      received interest from the researchers toward the development of a smart 
      stethoscope for decentralized diagnosis of heart disease. It is found that DTGNN 
      associates further flexibility to the approach which enables the classifier to 
      learn subtle contents of PCG, and meanwhile better copes with the complexities 
      intrinsically that exist in the medical applications such as the imbalance 
      training. The structural risk of the two methods is compared using the A-Test 
      method.

AB  - Cardiac-related disorders are rapidly growing throughout the world. Accurate 
      classification of cardiovascular diseases is an important research topic in 
      healthcare. During COVID-19, auscultating heart sounds was challenging as health 
      workers and doctors wear protective clothing, and direct contact with patients 
      can spread the outbreak. Thus, contactless auscultation of heart sound is 
      necessary. In this paper, a low-cost ear contactless stethoscope is designed 
      where auscultation is done with the help of a bluetooth-enabled micro speaker 
      instead of an earpiece. The PCG recordings are further compared with other 
      standard electronic stethoscopes like Littman 3 M. This work is made to improve 
      the performance of deep learning-based classifiers like recurrent neural networks 
      (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for different valvular heart 
      problems using tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate of optimizers, 
      dropout rate, and hidden layer. Hyper-parameter tuning is used to optimize the 
      performances of various deep learning models and their learning curves for 
      real-time analysis. The acoustic, time, and frequency domain features are used in 
      this research. The investigation is made on the heart sounds of normal and 
      diseased patients available from the standard data repository to train the 
      software models. The proposed CNN-based inception network model achieved an 
      accuracy of 99.65 ± 0.06% on the test dataset with a sensitivity of 98.8  ± 0.05% 
      and specificity of 98.2 ± 0.19%. The proposed hybrid CNN-RNN architecture 
      attained 91.17 ± 0.03% accuracy on test data after hyperparameter optimization, 
      whereas the LSTM-based RNN model achieved 82.32 ± 0.11% accuracy. Finally, the 
      evaluated results were compared with machine learning algorithms, and the 
      improved CNN-based Inception Net model is the most effective among others.

AB  - Decompensation episodes in chronic heart failure patients frequently result in 
      unplanned outpatient or emergency room visits or even hospitalizations. Early 
      detection of these episodes in their pre-symptomatic phase would likely enable 
      the clinicians to manage this patient cohort with the appropriate modification of 
      medical therapy which would in turn prevent the development of more severe heart 
      failure decompensation thus avoiding the need for heart failure-related 
      hospitalizations. Currently, heart failure worsening is recognized by the 
      clinicians through characteristic changes of heart failure-related symptoms and 
      signs, including the changes in heart sounds. The latter has proven to be largely 
      unreliable as its interpretation is highly subjective and dependent on the 
      clinicians' skills and preferences. Previous studies have indicated that the 
      algorithms of artificial intelligence are promising in distinguishing the heart 
      sounds of heart failure patients from those of healthy individuals. In this 
      manuscript, we focus on the analysis of heart sounds of chronic heart failure 
      patients in their decompensated and recompensated phase. The data was recorded on 
      37 patients using two types of electronic stethoscopes. Using a combination of 
      machine learning approaches, we obtained up to 72% classification accuracy 
      between the two phases, which is better than the accuracy of the interpretation 
      by cardiologists, which reached 50%. Our results demonstrate that machine 
      learning algorithms are promising in improving early detection of heart failure 
      decompensation episodes.

TI  - Rheumatic Heart Disease Detection Using Deep Learning from Spectro-Temporal 
      Representation of Un-segmented Heart Sounds.

AB  - Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is an autoimmune response to a bacterial attack 
      which deteriorates the normal functioning of the heart valves. The damage on the 
      valves affects the normal blood flow inside the heart chambers which can be 
      recorded and listened to via a stethoscope as a phonocardiogram. However, the 
      manual method of auscultation is difficult, time consuming and subjective. In 
      this study, a convolutional neural network based deep learning algorithm is used 
      to perform an automatic auscultation and it classifies the heart sound as normal 
      and rheumatic. The classification is done on un-segmented data where the 
      extraction of the first, the second and systolic and diastolic heart sounds are 
      not required. The architecture of the CNN network is formed as an array of 
      layers. Convolutional and batch normalization layers followed by a max pooling 
      layer to down sample the feature maps are used. At the end there is a final max 
      pooling layer which pools the input feature map globally over time and at the end 
      a fully connected layer is included. The network has five convolutional layers. 
      This current work illustrates the use of deep convolutional neural network using 
      a Mel Spectro-temporal representation. For this current study, an RHD heart sound 
      data set is recorded from one hundred seventy subjects from whom one hundred 
      twenty four are confirmed RHD patients. The system has an overall accuracy of 
      96.1% with 94.0% sensitivity and 98.1% and specificity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insufficient clinicians' auscultation ability delays the diagnosis 
      and treatment of valvular heart disease (VHD); artificial intelligence provides a 
      solution to compensate for the insufficiency in auscultation ability by 
      distinguishing between heart murmurs and normal heart sounds. However, whether 
      artificial intelligence can automatically diagnose VHD remains unknown. Our 
      objective was to use deep learning to process and compare raw heart sound data to 
      identify patients with VHD requiring intervention. METHODS: Heart sounds from 
      patients with VHD and healthy controls were collected using an electronic 
      stethoscope. Echocardiographic findings were used as the gold standard for this 
      study. According to the chronological order of enrollment, the early-enrolled 
      samples were used to train the deep learning model, and the late-enrollment 
      samples were used to validate the results. RESULTS: The final study population 
      comprised 499 patients (354 in the algorithm training group and 145 in the result 
      validation group). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 
      deep-learning model for identifying various VHDs ranged from 71.4 to 100.0%, 
      83.5-100.0%, and 84.1-100.0%, respectively; the best diagnostic performance was 
      observed for mitral stenosis, with a sensitivity of 100.0% (31.0-100.0%), a 
      specificity of 100% (96.7-100.0%), and an accuracy of 100% (97.5-100.0%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on raw heart sound data, the deep learning model effectively 
      identifies patients with various types of VHD who require intervention and 
      assists in the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of VHD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the limitations of current methods for detecting obstructive 
      coronary artery disease (CAD), many individuals are mistakenly or unnecessarily 
      referred for coronary angiography (CAG). OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to create a 
      comprehensive database of heart sounds in CAD and develop accurate deep learning 
      algorithms to efficiently detect obstructive CAD based on heart sound signals. 
      This will enable effective screening before undergoing CAG. METHODS: We included 
      320 subjects suspected of CAD who underwent CAG. We employed advanced filtering 
      techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models (VGG-16, 1D CNN, and 
      ResNet18) to analyze the heart sound signals and identify obstructive CAD 
      (defined as at least one ≥50 % stenosis). To assess the performance of our 
      models, we prospectively recruited an additional 80 subjects for testing. 
      RESULTS: In the test set, VGG-16 exhibited the highest performance with an area 
      under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.834 (95 % CI, 0.736-0.930), while ResNet-18 and 
      CNN-7 achieved AUCs of only 0.755 (95 % CI, 0.614-0.819) and 0.652 (95 % CI, 
      0.554-0.770) respectively. VGG-16 demonstrated a sensitivity of 80.4 % and 
      specificity of 86.2 % in the test set. The combined diagnostic model of VGG and 
      DF scores achieved an AUC of 0.915 (95 % CI: 0.855-0.974), and the AUC for VGG 
      combined with PTP scores was 0.908 (95 % CI: 0.845-0.971). The sensitivity and 
      specificity of VGG-16 exceeded 0.85 in patients with coronary artery occlusion 
      and those with 3 vascular lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning model, based on 
      heart sounds, offers a non-invasive and efficient screening method for 
      obstructive CAD. It is expected to significantly reduce the number of unnecessary 
      referrals for downstream screening.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI210876 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents an original method for studying the performance of the 
      supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods, the A-Test method. The method offers 
      the possibility of investigating the structural risk as well as the learning 
      capacity of ML methods in a quantitating manner. A-Test provides a powerful 
      validation method for the learning methods with small or medium size of the 
      learning data, where overfitting is regarded as a common problem of learning. 
      Such a condition can occur in many applications of bioinformatics and biomedical 
      engineering in which access to a large dataset is a challengeable task. 
      Performance of the A-Test method is explored by validation of two ML methods, 
      using real datasets of heart sound signals. The datasets comprise of children 
      cases with a normal heart condition as well as 4 pathological cases: aortic 
      stenosis, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary 
      stenosis. It is observed that the A-Test method provides further comprehensive 
      and more realistic information about the performance of the classification 
      methods as compared to the existing alternatives, the K-fold validation and 
      repeated random sub-sampling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac auscultation is a traditional method that is most frequently 
      used for identifying congenital heart disease (CHD). Failure to diagnose CHD may 
      occur in patients with faint murmurs or obesity. We aimed to develop an 
      intelligent diagnostic method of detecting heart murmurs in patients with 
      ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Digital recordings of heart sounds and phonocardiograms of 184 
      participants were obtained. All participants underwent echocardiography by 
      pediatric cardiologists to determine the type of CHD. The phonocardiogram data 
      were classified as normal, ASD, or VSD. Then, the phonocardiogram signal was used 
      to extract features to construct diagnostic models for disease classification 
      using an advanced optical coherence tomography network (AOCT-NET). Cardiologists 
      were asked to distinguish normal heart sounds from ASD/VSD murmurs after 
      listening to the electronic sound recordings. Comparisons of the cardiologists' 
      assessment and AOCT-NET performance were performed. RESULTS: Echocardiography 
      results revealed 88 healthy participants, 50 with ASDs, and 46 with VSDs. The 
      AOCT-NET had no advantage in detecting VSD compared with cardiologist assessment. 
      However, AOCT-NET performance was better than that of cardiologists in detecting 
      ASD (sensitivity, 76.4 vs. 27.8%, respectively; specificity, 90 vs. 98.5%, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The proposed method has the potential to improve the

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease 
      (CHD-PAH) is a fatal cardiovascular disease. A novel method for non-invasive 
      initial diagnosis of the CHD-PAH was put forward in this work. First, original 
      heart sounds were segmented into each cardiac cycle by using double-threshold 
      adaptive method. According to clinical auscultation, the pathological information 
      of CHD-PAH is concentrated in S2, so the time-frequency features in both of an 
      entire cardiac cycle and S2 were extracted. Then the time-frequency features 
      combine with the deep learning features to form a feature vector. It is the 
      fusion feature, which will be input into a classifier. Finally, the majority 
      voting algorithm was used to obtain the optimal classification results. A 
      classification accuracy of 88.61% was achieved using this novel method. Three 
      points are essential: •A double-threshold adaptive method is used to segment 
      heart sound into each cardiac cycle.•The time-frequency domain features in both 
      of an entire cardiac cycle and S2 were extracted, which are combined with deep 
      learning features to form the fusion feature.•The XGBoost was used as three-class 
      classifier for the classification of normal, CHD and CHD-PAH. The majority voting 
      algorithm was used to obtain the optimal classification results.

TI  - Heart Sound Segmentation Using Bidirectional LSTMs With Attention.
PG  - 1601-1609
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2949516 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a novel framework for the segmentation of 
      phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into heart states, exploiting the temporal 
      evolution of the PCG as well as considering the salient information that it 
      provides for the detection of the heart state. METHODS: We propose the use of 
      recurrent neural networks and exploit recent advancements in attention based 
      learning to segment the PCG signal. This allows the network to identify the most 
      salient aspects of the signal and disregard uninformative information. RESULTS: 
      The proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks 
      including both human and animal heart recordings. Furthermore, we empirically 
      analyse different feature combinations including envelop features, wavelet and 
      Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and provide quantitative measurements 
      that explore the importance of different features in the proposed approach. 
      CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a recurrent neural network coupled with attention 
      mechanisms can effectively learn from irregular and noisy PCG recordings. Our 
      analysis of different feature combinations shows that MFCC features and their 
      derivatives offer the best performance compared to classical wavelet and envelop 
      features. SIGNIFICANCE: Heart sound segmentation is a crucial pre-processing step 
      for many diagnostic applications. The proposed method provides a cost effective 
      alternative to labour extensive manual segmentation, and provides a more accurate 
      segmentation than existing methods. As such, it can improve the performance of 
      further analysis including the detection of murmurs and ejection clicks. The 
      proposed method is also applicable for detection and segmentation of other one 
      dimensional biomedical signals.

      using phonocardiogram.
PG  - 1-26
LID - 10.1080/0954898X.2023.2270040 [doi]
AB  - In the diagnosis of cardiac disorders Heart sound has a major role, and early 
      detection is crucial to safeguard the patients. Computerized strategies of heart 
      sound classification advocate intensive and more exact results in a quick and 
      better manner. Using a hybrid optimization-controlled deep learning strategy this 
      paper proposed an automatic heart sound classification module. The parameter 
      tuning of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier in a satisfactory manner is 
      the importance of this research which depends on the Hybrid Sneaky optimization 
      algorithm. The developed sneaky optimization algorithm inherits the traits of 
      questing and societal search agents. Moreover, input data from the 
      Phonocardiogram (PCG) database undergoes the process of feature extraction which 
      extract the important features, like statistical, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), 
      and to enhance the performance of this model, the features of Mel frequency 
      Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are assisted. The developed Sneaky 
      optimization-based DNN classifier's performance is determined in respect of the 
      metrics, namely precision, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, which are 
      around 97%, 96.98%, 97%, and 96.9%, respectively.

TI  - A Low-Cost AI-Empowered Stethoscope and a Lightweight Model for Detecting Cardiac 
      and Respiratory Diseases from Lung and Heart Auscultation Sounds.
LID - 10.3390/s23052591 [doi]
LID - 2591
AB  - Cardiac and respiratory diseases are the primary causes of health problems. If we 
      can automate anomalous heart and lung sound diagnosis, we can improve the early 
      detection of disease and enable the screening of a wider population than possible 
      with manual screening. We propose a lightweight yet powerful model for 
      simultaneous lung and heart sound diagnosis, which is deployable in an embedded 
      low-cost device and is valuable in remote areas or developing countries where 
      Internet access may not be available. We trained and tested the proposed model 
      with the ICBHI and the Yaseen datasets. The experimental results showed that our 
      11-class prediction model could achieve 99.94% accuracy, 99.84% precision, 99.89% 
      specificity, 99.66% sensitivity, and 99.72% F1 score. We designed a digital 
      stethoscope (around USD 5) and connected it to a low-cost, single-board-computer 
      Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (around USD 20), on which our pretrained model can be 
      smoothly run. This AI-empowered digital stethoscope is beneficial for anyone in 
      the medical field, as it can automatically provide diagnostic results and produce 
      digital audio records for further analysis.

TI  - Improving Valvular Pathologies and Ventricular Dysfunction Diagnostic Efficiency 
      Using Combined Auscultation and Electrocardiography Data: A Multimodal AI 
      Approach.
LID - 10.3390/s23249834 [doi]
LID - 9834
AB  - Simple sensor-based procedures, including auscultation and electrocardiography 
      (ECG), can facilitate early diagnosis of valvular diseases, resulting in timely 
      treatment. This study assessed the impact of combining these sensor-based 
      procedures with machine learning on diagnosing valvular abnormalities and 
      ventricular dysfunction. Data from auscultation at three distinct locations and 
      12-lead ECGs were collected from 1052 patients undergoing echocardiography. An 
      independent cohort of 103 patients was used for clinical validation. These 
      patients were screened for severe aortic stenosis (AS), severe mitral 
      regurgitation (MR), and left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) with ejection 
      fractions ≤ 40%. Optimal neural networks were identified by a fourfold 
      cross-validation training process using heart sounds and various ECG leads, and 
      their outputs were combined using a stacking technique. This composite sensor 
      model had high diagnostic efficiency (area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) values: AS, 0.93; MR, 0.80; LVD, 0.75). Notably, the 
      contribution of individual sensors to disease detection was found to be 
      disease-specific, underscoring the synergistic potential of the sensor fusion 
      approach. Thus, machine learning models that integrate auscultation and ECG can 
      efficiently detect conditions typically diagnosed via imaging. Moreover, this 
      study highlights the potential of multimodal artificial intelligence 
      applications.

TI  - Supervised threshold-based heart sound classification algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep classification networks have been one of the predominant methods 
      for classifying heart sound recordings. To satisfy their demand for sample size, 
      the most commonly used method for data augmentation is that which divides each 
      heart sound instance into a number of segments, with each segment labelled as the 
      same category as its origin and used as a new sample for training or forecasting. 
      However, performing this poses a crucial issue as to how to determine the 
      category of a predicted heart sound instance from its segments' prediction 
      results. APPROACH: To solve this issue, this paper establishes a mathematical 
      formula to connect the classification performance of these heart sound instances 
      with the prediction results of their segments via a threshold which is supervised 
      by the training set. The optimal value of the proposed threshold is calculated by 
      maximizing the prediction accuracy of the training instances. Seeking the optimal 
      threshold by a gradient-based method, we prove that a continuous function can 
      closely approximate a part of the function of accuracy which transforms the 
      discrete function of accuracy into a continuous function. The optimal threshold 
      is used to recognize the undetermined heart sound recording. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Experimental results show the classification performance from a 10-fold 
      cross-validation, measured by the commonly used scales of sensitivity, 
      specificity and mean accuracy (MAcc). The proposed algorithm improves the MAcc by 
      about 4% by modifying the baseline. In addition, the MAcc surpasses the champion 
      of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study 
      develops a methodology to determine the category of a predicted heart sound 
      instance from its segments' prediction results, thus assisting in the data 
      augmentation exercise which is necessary to provide sufficient data for deep 
      classification networks. Our method significantly improves the classification 
      performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the ability of state-of-the-art machine 
      learning algorithms to detect valvular heart disease (VHD) from digital heart 
      sound recordings in a general population that includes asymptomatic cases and 
      intermediate stages of disease progression. METHODS: We trained a recurrent 
      neural network to predict murmurs from heart sound audio using annotated 
      recordings collected with digital stethoscopes from four auscultation positions 
      in 2,124 participants from the Tromsø7 study. The predicted murmurs were used to 
      predict VHD as determined by echocardiography. RESULTS: The presence of aortic 
      stenosis (AS) was detected with a sensitivity of 90.9%, a specificity of 94.5%, 
      and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.979 (CI: 0.963-0.995). At least moderate 
      AS was detected with an AUC of 0.993 (CI: 0.989-0.997). Moderate or greater 
      aortic and mitral regurgitation (AR and MR) were predicted with AUC values of 
      0.634 (CI: 0.565-703) and 0.549 (CI: 0.506-0.593), respectively, which increased 
      to 0.766 and 0.677 when clinical variables were added as predictors. The AUC for 
      predicting symptomatic cases was higher for AR and MR, 0.756 and 0.711, 
      respectively. Screening jointly for symptomatic regurgitation or presence of 
      stenosis resulted in an AUC of 0.86, with 97.7% of AS cases (n = 44) and all 12 
      MS cases detected. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm demonstrated excellent performance 
      in detecting AS in a general cohort, surpassing observations from similar studies 
      on selected cohorts. The detection of AR and MR based on HS audio was poor, but 
      accuracy was considerably higher for symptomatic cases, and the inclusion of 
      clinical variables improved the performance of the model significantly.

AB  - Auscultation of heart sounds is an important method for the diagnosis of heart 
      conditions. For most people, the audible component of heart sound are the first 
      heart sound (S1) and the second heart sound (S2). Different diseases usually 
      generate murmurs at different stages in a cardiac cycle. Segmenting the heart 
      sounds precisely is the prerequisite for diagnosis. S1 and S2 emerges at the 
      beginning of systole and diastole, respectively. Locating S1 and S2 accurately is 
      beneficial for the segmentation of heart sounds. This paper proposed a method to 
      classify the S1 and S2 based on their properties, and did not take use of the 
      duration of systole and diastole. S1 and S2 in the training dataset were 
      transformed to spectra by short-time Fourier transform and be feed to the 
      two-stream convolutional neural network. The classification accuracy of the test 
      dataset was as high as 91.135%. The highest sensitivity and specificity were 
      91.156% and 92.074%, respectively. Extracting the features of the input signals 
      artificially can be avoid with the method proposed in this article. The 
      calculation is not complicated, which makes this method effective for 
      distinguishing S1 and S2 in real time.

AB  - Assessment of heart sounds which are generated by the beating heart and the 
      resultant blood flow through it provides a valuable tool for cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) diagnostics. The cardiac auscultation using the classical 
      stethoscope phonological cardiogram is known as the most famous exam method to 
      detect heart anomalies. This exam requires a qualified cardiologist, who relies 
      on the cardiac cycle vibration sound (heart muscle contractions and valves 
      closure) to detect abnormalities in the heart during the pumping action. 
      Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal represents the recording of sounds and murmurs 
      resulting from the heart auscultation, typically with a stethoscope, as a part of 
      medical diagnosis. For the sake of helping physicians in a clinical environment, 
      a range of artificial intelligence methods was proposed to automatically analyze 
      PCG signal to help in the preliminary diagnosis of different heart diseases. The 
      aim of this research paper is providing an accurate CVD recognition model based 
      on unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods relayed on convolutional 
      neural network (CNN). The proposed approach is evaluated on heart sound signals 
      from the well-known, publicly available PASCAL and PhysioNet datasets. 
      Experimental results show that the heart cycle segmentation and segment selection 
      processes have a direct impact on the validation accuracy, sensitivity (TPR), 
      precision (PPV), and specificity (TNR). Based on PASCAL dataset, we obtained 
      encouraging classification results with overall accuracy 0.87, overall precision 
      0.81, and overall sensitivity 0.83. Concerning Micro classification results, we 
      obtained Micro accuracy 0.91, Micro sensitivity 0.83, Micro precision 0.84, and 
      Micro specificity 0.92. Using PhysioNet dataset, we achieved very good results: 
      0.97 accuracy, 0.946 sensitivity, 0.944 precision, and 0.946 specificity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is an important cause of 
      morbidity and mortality. Echocardiography is the reference standard for VHD 
      diagnosis but is not universally accessible. Manual cardiac auscultation is 
      inadequate for screening VHD. Many machine learning models using heart sounds 
      acquired with an electronic stethoscope may improve the accuracy of VHD 
      diagnosis. We aimed to develop an accurate sound classification model for VHD 
      diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new large stethoscope sound dataset 
      containing 10,366 heart sounds divided into ten categories (nine VHD and one 
      healthy) were prospectively collected. We developed a handcrafted learning model 
      that comprised multilevel feature extraction based on a dual symmetric tree 
      pattern (DSTP) and multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT), feature 
      selection, and classification. The multilevel DWT was used to create subbands to 
      extract features at both high and low levels. Then, iterative neighborhood 
      component analysis was used to select the most discriminative 512 features from 
      among the extracted features in the generated feature vector. In the 
      classification phase, a support vector machine (SVM) was used with 10-fold 
      cross-validation (CV) and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) CV. RESULTS: Our proposed 
      DSTP-based model attained 99.58% and 99.84% classification accuracies using SVM 
      classifier with 10-fold CV and LOSO CV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presented 
      DSTP-based classification model attained excellent multiclass classification 
      performance on a large prospective heart sound dataset at a low computational 
      cost.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: When training machine learning models, we often assume that the 
      training data and evaluation data are sampled from the same distribution. 
      However, this assumption is violated when the model is evaluated on another 
      unseen but similar database, even if that database contains the same classes. 
      This problem is caused by domain-shift and can be solved using two approaches: 
      domain adaptation and domain generalization. Simply, domain adaptation methods 
      can access data from unseen domains during training; whereas in domain 
      generalization, the unseen data is not available during training. Hence, domain 
      generalization concerns models that perform well on inaccessible, domain-shifted 
      data. METHOD: Our proposed domain generalization method represents an unseen 
      domain using a set of known basis domains, afterwhich we classify the unseen 
      domain using classifier fusion. To demonstrate our system, we employ a collection 
      of heart sound databases that contain normal and abnormal sounds (classes). 
      RESULTS: Our proposed classifier fusion method achieves accuracy gains of up to 
      16% for four completely unseen domains. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the complexity 
      induced by the inherent temporal nature of biosignal data, the two-stage method 
      proposed in this study is able to effectively simplify the whole process of 
      domain generalization while demonstrating good results on unseen domains and the 
      adopted basis domains. SIGNIFICANCE: To our best knowledge, this is the first 
      study that investigates domain generalization for biosignal data. Our proposed 
      learning strategy can be used to effectively learn domain-relevant features while 
      being aware of the class differences in the data.

TI  - Narrative review of the role of artificial intelligence to improve aortic valve 
      disease management.

AB  - Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a chronic progressive condition with an 
      increasing prevalence in the Western world due to aging populations. VHD is often 
      diagnosed at a late stage when patients are symptomatic and the outcomes of 
      therapy, including valve replacement, may be sub-optimal due the development of 
      secondary complications, including left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The 
      clinical application of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning 
      (ML), has promise in supporting not only early and more timely diagnosis, but 
      also hastening patient referral and ensuring optimal treatment of VHD. As 
      physician auscultation lacks accuracy in diagnosis of significant VHD, 
      computer-aided auscultation (CAA) with the help of a commercially available 
      digital stethoscopes improves the detection and classification of heart murmurs. 
      Although used little in current clinical practice, CAA can screen large 
      populations at low cost with high accuracy for VHD and faciliate appropriate 
      patient referral. Echocardiography remains the next step in assessment and 
      planning management and AI is delivering major changes in speeding training, 
      improving image quality by pattern recognition and image sorting, as well as 
      automated measurement of multiple variables, thereby improving accuracy. 
      Furthermore, AI then has the potential to hasten patient disposal, by automated 
      alerts for red-flag findings, as well as decision support in dealing with 
      results. In management, there is great potential in ML-enabled tools to support 
      comprehensive disease monitoring and individualized treatment decisions. Using 
      data from multiple sources, including demographic and clinical risk data to image 
      variables and electronic reports from electronic medical records, specific 
      patient phenotypes may be identified that are associated with greater risk or 
      modeled to the estimate trajectory of VHD progression. Finally, AI algorithms are 
      of proven value in planning intervention, facilitating transcatheter valve 
      replacement by automated measurements of anatomical dimensions derived from 
      imaging data to improve valve selection, valve size and method of delivery.

TI  - S2 Heart Sound Detects Aortic Valve Calcification Independent of Hemodynamic 
      Changes in Mice.
PG  - 809301
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.809301 [doi]
LID - 809301
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is often undiagnosed in 
      asymptomatic patients, especially in underserved populations. Although artificial 
      intelligence has improved murmur detection in auscultation exams, murmur 
      manifestation depends on hemodynamic factors that can be independent of aortic 
      valve (AoV) calcium load and function. The aim of this study was to determine if 
      the presence of AoV calcification directly influences the S2 heart sound. 
      METHODS: Adult C57BL/6J mice were assigned to the following 12-week-long diets: 
      (1) Control group (n = 11) fed a normal chow, (2) Adenine group (n = 4) fed an 
      adenine-supplemented diet to induce chronic kidney disease (CKD), and (3) Adenine 
      + HP (n = 9) group fed the CKD diet for 6 weeks, then supplemented with high 
      phosphate (HP) for another 6 weeks to induce AoV calcification. Phonocardiograms, 
      echocardiogram-based valvular function, and AoV calcification were assessed at 
      endpoint. RESULTS: Mice on the Adenine + HP diet had detectable AoV calcification 
      (9.28 ± 0.74% by volume). After segmentation and dimensionality reduction, S2 
      sounds were labeled based on the presence of disease: Healthy, CKD, or CKD + 
      CAVD. The dataset (2,516 S2 sounds) was split subject-wise, and an ensemble 
      learning-based algorithm was developed to classify S2 sound features. For 
      external validation, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      of the algorithm to classify mice were 0.9940 for Healthy, 0.9717 for CKD, and 
      0.9593 for CKD + CAVD. The algorithm had a low misclassification performance of 
      testing set S2 sounds (1.27% false positive, 1.99% false negative). CONCLUSION: 
      Our ensemble learning-based algorithm demonstrated the feasibility of using the 
      S2 sound to detect the presence of AoV calcification. The S2 sound can be used as 
      a marker to identify AoV calcification independent of hemodynamic changes 
      observed in echocardiography.

TI  - Parameter-Efficient Densely Connected Dual Attention Network for Phonocardiogram 
      Classification.
PG  - 4240-4249
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3286585 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac auscultation, exhibited by phonocardiogram (PCG), is a non-invasive and 
      low-cost diagnostic method for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, deploying 
      it in practice is quite challenging, due to the inherent murmurs and a limited 
      number of supervised samples in heart sound data. To solve these problems, not 
      only heart sound analysis based on handcrafted features, but also computer-aided 
      heart sound analysis based on deep learning have been extensively studied in 
      recent years. Though with elaborate design, most of these methods still use 
      additional pre-processing to improve classification performance, which heavily 
      relies on time-consuming experienced engineering. In this article, we propose a 
      parameter-efficient densely connected dual attention network (DDA) for heart 
      sound classification. It combines two advantages simultaneously of the purely 
      end-to-end architecture and enriched contextual representations of the 
      self-attention mechanism. Specifically, the densely connected structure can 
      automatically extract the information flow of heart sound features 
      hierarchically. Alongside, improving contextual modeling capabilities, the dual 
      attention mechanism adaptively aggregates local features with global dependencies 
      via a self-attention mechanism, which captures the semantic interdependencies 
      across position and channel axes respectively. Extensive experiments across 
      stratified 10-fold cross-validation strongly evidence that our proposed DDA model 
      surpasses current 1D deep models on the challenging Cinc2016 benchmark with 
      significant computational efficiency.

TI  - Real-Time Smart-Digital Stethoscope System for Heart Diseases Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s19122781 [doi]
LID - 2781
AB  - One of the major causes of death all over the world is heart disease or cardiac 
      dysfunction. These diseases could be identified easily with the variations in the 
      sound produced due to the heart activity. These sophisticated auscultations need 
      important clinical experience and concentrated listening skills. Therefore, there 
      is an unmet need for a portable system for the early detection of cardiac 
      illnesses. This paper proposes a prototype model of a smart digital-stethoscope 
      system to monitor patient's heart sounds and diagnose any abnormality in a 
      real-time manner. This system consists of two subsystems that communicate 
      wirelessly using Bluetooth low energy technology: A portable digital stethoscope 
      subsystem, and a computer-based decision-making subsystem. The portable subsystem 
      captures the heart sounds of the patient, filters and digitizes, and sends the 
      captured heart sounds to a personal computer wirelessly to visualize the heart 
      sounds and for further processing to make a decision if the heart sounds are 
      normal or abnormal. Twenty-seven t-domain, f-domain, and Mel frequency cepstral 
      coefficients (MFCC) features were used to train a public database to identify the 
      best-performing algorithm for classifying abnormal and normal heart sound (HS). 
      The hyper parameter optimization, along with and without a feature reduction 
      method, was tested to improve accuracy. The cost-adjusted optimized ensemble 
      algorithm can produce 97% and 88% accuracy of classifying abnormal and normal HS, 
      respectively.

AB  - The phonocardiogram (PCG) or heart sound auscultation is a low-cost and 
      non-invasive method to diagnose Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). However, 
      recognizing CHD in the pediatric population based on heart sounds is difficult 
      because it requires high medical training and skills. Also, the dependency of PCG 
      signal quality on sensor location and developing heart in children are 
      challenging. This study proposed a deep learning model that classifies 
      unprocessed or raw PCG signals to diagnose CHD using a one-dimensional 
      Convolution Neural Network (1D-CNN) with an attention transformer. The model was 
      built on the raw PCG data of 484 patients. The results showed that the attention 
      transformer model had a good balance of accuracy of 0.923, a sensitivity of 
      0.973, and a specificity of 0.833. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
      plot generated an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.964, and the F1-score was 
      0.939. The suggested model could provide quick and appropriate real-time remote 
      diagnosis application in classifying PCG of CHD from non-CHD subjects.Clinical 
      Relevance- The suggested methodology can be utilized to analyze PCG signals more 
      quickly and affordably for rural doctors as a first screening tool before sending 
      the cases to experts.

TI  - Heart sound classification using the SNMFNet classifier.
PG  - 105003
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab45c8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heart sound classification still suffers from the challenges involved 
      in achieving high accuracy in the case of small samples. Dimension reduction 
      attempts to extract low-dimensional features with more discriminability from 
      high-dimensional spaces or raw data, and is popular in learning predictive models 
      that target small sample problems. However, it can also be harmful to 
      classification, because any reduction has the potential to lose information 
      containing category attributes. APPROACH: For this, a novel SNMFNet classifier is 
      designed to directly associate the dimension reduction process with the 
      classification procedure used for promoting feature dimension reduction to follow 
      the approach that is beneficial for classification, thus making the 
      low-dimensional features more distinguishable and addressing the challenge facing 
      heart sound classification in small samples. MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated our 
      method and representative methods using a public heart sound dataset. The 
      experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all comparative 
      models with an obvious improvement in small samples. Furthermore, even if used 
      with relatively sufficient samples, our method performs at least as well as the 
      baseline that uses the same high-dimensional features. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed 
      SNMFNet classifier significantly to improves the small sample problem in heart 
      sound classification.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely proposed for different tasks 
      of heart sound analysis. This paper presents the results of a novel study on the 
      performance of a conventional CNN in comparison to the different architectures of 
      recurrent neural networks combined with CNN for the classification task of 
      abnormal-normal heart sounds. The study considers various combinations of 
      parallel and cascaded integration of CNN with Gated Recurrent Network (GRN) as 
      well as Long- Short Term Memory (LSTM) and explores the accuracy and sensitivity 
      of each integration independently, using the Physionet dataset of heart sound 
      recordings. The accuracy of the parallel architecture of LSTM-CNN reached 98.0% 
      outperforming all the combined architectures, with a sensitivity of 87.2%. The 
      conventional CNN offered sensitivity/accuracy of 95.9%/97.3% with far less 
      complexity. Results show that a conventional CNN can appropriately perform and 
      solely employed for the classification of heart sound signals.

TI  - Can empirical mode decomposition improve heartbeat detection in fetal 
      phonocardiography signals?

LID - S0169-2607(21)00113-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A fetal phonocardiography signal can be hard to 
      interpret and classify due to various sources of additive noise in the womb, 
      spanning from fetal movement to maternal heart sounds. Nevertheless, the 
      non-invasive nature of the method makes it potentially suitable for long-term 
      monitoring of fetal health, especially since it can be implemented on ubiquitous 
      devices such as smartphones. We have employed empirical mode decomposition for 
      the extraction of intrinsic mode functions that would enable the utilization of 
      additional characteristics from the signal. METHODS: Fetal heart recordings from 
      7 pregnant women in the 3rd trimester or pregnancy were taken in parallel with a 
      measurement microphone and a portable Doppler device. Signal peaks positions from 
      the Doppler were taken as the locations of S1 heart sounds and subsequently used 
      as classification labels for the microphone signal. After employing a moving 
      window approach for segmentation, more than 7600 observations were stored in the 
      final dataset. The 135 extracted features consisted of typical audio temporal and 
      spectral characteristics, each taken from separate sets of audio signals and 
      intrinsic mode functions. We have used a number of metrics and methods to 
      validate the usability of features, including univariate analysis of feature 
      ranking and importance. Furthermore, we have used machine learning to train a 
      number of classifiers to validate the usability of features based on intrinsic 
      mode functions, taking prediction accuracy as the comparison metric. RESULTS: 
      Features extracted from intrinsic mode functions combined with audio features 
      significantly improve accuracy in comparison to using only audio features. The 
      improvements of detection accuracy obtained with a selected set of combined 
      features spanned from 3.8% to even 10.3% based on the employed classifier. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have utilized empirical mode decomposition as a method of 
      extracting features relevant for fetal heartbeat classification. The results show 
      consistent improvements in detection accuracy when these characteristics are 
      added to a set of conventional audio features. This implies substantial benefits 
      of applying empirical mode decomposition and lays the groundwork for future 
      research on fetal heartbeat detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Valvular heart diseases (VHDs) are one of the dominant 
      causes of cardiovascular abnormalities that have been associated with high 
      mortality rates globally. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the early stage of VHD 
      based on cardiac phonocardiogram (PCG) signal is critical that allows for optimum 
      medication and reduction of mortality rate. METHODS: To this end, the current 
      study proposes novel deep learning (DL)-based high-performance VHD detection 
      frameworks that are relatively simpler in terms of network structures, yet 
      effective for accurately detecting multiple VHDs. We present three different 
      frameworks considering both 1D and 2D PCG raw signals. For 1D PCG, Mel frequency 
      cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCC) 
      features, whereas, for 2D PCG, various deep convolutional neural networks 
      (D-CNNs) features are extracted. Additionally, nature/bio-inspired algorithms 
      (NIA/BIA) including particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) 
      have been utilized for automatic and efficient feature selection directly from 
      the raw PCG signal. To further improve the performance of the classifier, vision 
      transformer (ViT) has been implemented levering the self-attention mechanism on 
      the time frequency representation (TFR) of 2D PCG signal. Our extensive study 
      presents a comparative performance analysis and the scope of enhancement for the 
      combination of different descriptors, classifiers, and feature selection 
      algorithms. MAIN RESULTS: Among all classifiers, ViT provides the best 
      performance by achieving mean average accuracy A(cc) of 99.90 % and F1-score of 
      99.95 % outperforming current state-of-the-art VHD classification models. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present research provides a robust and efficient DL-based 
      end-to-end PCG signal classification framework for designing a automated 
      high-performance VHD diagnosis system.

AB  - One in every four newborns suffers from congenital heart disease (CHD) that 
      causes defects in the heart structure. The current gold-standard assessment 
      technique, echocardiography, causes delays in the diagnosis owing to the need for 
      experts who vary markedly in their ability to detect and interpret pathological 
      patterns. Moreover, echo is still causing cost difficulties for low- and 
      middle-income countries. Here, we developed a deep learning-based attention 
      transformer model to automate the detection of heart murmurs caused by CHD at an 
      early stage of life using cost-effective and widely available phonocardiography 
      (PCG). PCG recordings were obtained from 942 young patients at four major 
      auscultation locations, including the aortic valve (AV), mitral valve (MV), 
      pulmonary valve (PV), and tricuspid valve (TV), and they were annotated by 
      experts as absent, present, or unknown murmurs. A transformation to wavelet 
      features was performed to reduce the dimensionality before the deep learning 
      stage for inferring the medical condition. The performance was validated through 
      10-fold cross-validation and yielded an average accuracy and sensitivity of 90.23 
      % and 72.41 %, respectively. The accuracy of discriminating between murmurs' 
      absence and presence reached 76.10 % when evaluated on unseen data. The model had 
      accuracies of 70 %, 88 %, and 86 % in predicting murmur presence in infants, 
      children, and adolescents, respectively. The interpretation of the model revealed 
      proper discrimination between the learned attributes, and AV channel was found 
      important (score 0.75) for the murmur absence predictions while MV and TV were 
      more important for murmur presence predictions. The findings potentiate deep 
      learning as a powerful front-line tool for inferring CHD status in PCG recordings 
      leveraging early detection of heart anomalies in young people. It is suggested as 
      a tool that can be used independently from high-cost machinery or expert 
      assessment.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study performed on Parallel Convolutional 
      Neural Network (PCNN) toward detecting heart abnormalities from the heart sound 
      signals. The PCNN preserves dynamic contents of the signal in a parallel 
      combination of the recurrent neural network and a Convolutional Neural Network 
      (CNN). The performance of the PCNN is evaluated and compared to the one obtained 
      from a Serial form of the Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) as well as two 
      other baseline studies: a Long- and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and a 
      Conventional CNN (CCNN). We employed a well-known public dataset of heart sound 
      signals: the Physionet heart sound. The accuracy of the PCNN, was estimated to be 
      87.2% which outperforms the rest of the three methods: the SCNN, the LSTM, and 
      the CCNN by 12%, 7%, and 0.5%, respectively. The resulting method can be easily 
      implemented in an Internet of Things platform to be employed as a decision 
      support system for the screening heart abnormalities.

TI  - Do we really need a segmentation step in heart sound classification algorithms?

AB  - Cardiac auscultation is the key screening procedure to detect and identify 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of many steps to automatically detect CVDs 
      using auscultation, concerns the detection and delimitation of the heart sound 
      boundaries, a process known as segmentation. Whether to include or not a 
      segmentation step in the signal classification pipeline is nowadays a topic of 
      discussion. Up to our knowledge, the outcome of a segmentation algorithm has been 
      used almost exclusively to align the different signal segments according to the 
      heartbeat. In this paper, the need for a heartbeat alignment step is tested and 
      evaluated over different machine learning algorithms, including deep learning 
      solutions. From the different classifiers tested, Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
      Network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms are shown to be the 
      most robust. Namely, these algorithms can detect the presence of heart murmurs 
      even without a heartbeat alignment step. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine 
      (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms require an explicit segmentation step to 
      effectively detect heart sounds and murmurs, the overall performance is expected 
      drop approximately 5% on both cases.

TI  - Detecting Aortic Valve Anomaly From Induced Murmurs: Insights From Computational 
      Hemodynamic Models.

AB  - Patients who receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement are at risk for 
      leaflet thrombosis-related complications, and can benefit from continuous, 
      longitudinal monitoring of the prosthesis. Conventional angiography modalities 
      are expensive, hospital-centric and either invasive or employ potentially 
      nephrotoxic contrast agents, which preclude their routine use. Heart sounds have 
      been long recognized to contain valuable information about individual valve 
      function, but the skill of auscultation is in decline due to its heavy reliance 
      on the physician's proficiency leading to poor diagnostic repeatability. This 
      subjectivity in diagnosis can be alleviated using machine learning techniques for 
      anomaly detection. We present a computational and data-driven proof-of-concept 
      analysis of a novel, auscultation-based technique for monitoring aortic valve, 
      which is practical, non-invasive, and non-toxic. However, the underlying 
      mechanisms leading to physiological and pathological heart sounds are not 
      well-understood, which hinders development of such a technique. We first address 
      this by performing direct numerical simulations of the complex interactions 
      between turbulent blood flow in a canonical ascending aorta model and dynamic 
      valve motion in 29 cases with healthy and stenotic valves. Using the turbulent 
      pressure fluctuations on the aorta lumen boundary, we model the propagation of 
      heart sounds, as elastic waves, through the patient's thorax. The heart sound may 
      be recorded on the epidermal surface using a stethoscope/phonocardiograph. This 
      approach allows us to correlate instantaneous hemodynamic phenomena and valve 
      motion with the acoustic response. From this dataset we extract "acoustic 
      signatures" of healthy and stenotic valves based on principal components of the 
      recorded sound. These signatures are used to train a linear discriminant 
      classifier by maximizing correlation between recorded heart sounds and valve 
      status. We demonstrate that this classifier is capable of accurate prospective 
      detection of anomalous valve function and that the principal component-based 
      signatures capture prominent audible features of heart sounds, which have been 
      historically used by physicians for diagnosis. Further development of such 
      technology can enable inexpensive, safe and patient-centric at-home monitoring, 
      and can extend beyond transcatheter valves to surgical as well as native valves.

TI  - Time-Frequency Fragment Selection for Disease Detection from Imbalanced 
      Phonocardiogram Data.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10339998 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the most concerning disease worldwide. A 
      Phonocardiogram (PCG), the graphical representation of heart sound, is a 
      non-invasive method that helps to detect CVD by analyzing its characteristics. 
      Several machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed in the last decade to 
      assist practitioners in interpreting this disease accurately. However, the 
      ML-based method requires a considerable amount of PCG data with a balance between 
      data categories for unbiased performance. Moreover, PCG data in the literature is 
      scarce, and the available database has a strong imbalance between the normal and 
      abnormal categories. This data imbalance causes outcomes to be severely biased 
      towards classes with greater samples. This work proposes a variable-hop fragment 
      selection method with a pre-trained CNN model to counter the issues of data 
      scarcity and imbalance. The proposed framework improves 7.12% of unweighted 
      average recall (UAR) value for assessing an imbalanced PCG dataset compared to 
      the state-of-the-art method and reports an overall UAR of 92.46% on the 
      PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 dataset. The improved performance signifies the 
      clinical relevance of the work providing reliable assistance for heart 
      auscultation and has the potential to screen for heart pathologies in data 
      constraint applications.

LID - 10.7507/1001-5515.202006025 [doi]
AB  - Heart sound is one of the common medical signals for diagnosing cardiovascular 
      diseases. This paper studies the binary classification between normal or abnormal 
      heart sounds, and proposes a heart sound classification algorithm based on the 
      joint decision of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural network, 
      achieving a further improvement in feature extraction and model accuracy. First, 
      the preprocessed heart sound recordings are segmented into four status, and five 
      categories of features are extracted from the signals based on segmentation. The 
      first four categories of features are sieved through recursive feature 
      elimination, which is used as the input of the XGBoost classifier. The last 
      category is the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), which is used as the 
      input of long short-term memory network (LSTM). Considering the imbalance of the 
      data set, these two classifiers are both improved with weights. Finally, the 
      heterogeneous integrated decision method is adopted to obtain the prediction. The 
      algorithm was applied to the open heart sound database of the PhysioNet Computing 
      in Cardiology(CINC) Challenge in 2016 on the PhysioNet website, to test the 
      sensitivity, specificity, modified accuracy and F score. The results were 93%, 
      89.4%, 91.2% and 91.3% respectively. Compared with the results of machine 
      learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other methods used by other 
      researchers, the accuracy and sensibility have been obviously improved, which 
      proves that the method in this paper could effectively improve the accuracy of 
      heart sound signal classification, and has great potential in the clinical 
      auxiliary diagnosis application of some cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Gated recurrent unit-based heart sound analysis for heart failure screening.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/s12938-020-0747-x [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a type of cardiovascular disease caused by 
      abnormal cardiac structure and function. Early screening of HF has important 
      implication for treatment in a timely manner. Heart sound (HS) conveys relevant 
      information related to HF; this study is therefore based on the analysis of HS 
      signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of 
      normal, HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction 
      automatically. METHODS: We proposed a novel HF screening framework based on gated 
      recurrent unit (GRU) model in this study. The logistic regression-based hidden 
      semi-Markov model was adopted to segment HS frames. Normalized frames were taken 
      as the input of the proposed model which can automatically learn the deep 
      features and complete the HF screening without de-nosing and hand-crafted feature 
      extraction. RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of proposed model, three methods 
      are used for comparison. The results show that the GRU model gives a satisfactory 
      performance with average accuracy of 98.82%, which is better than other 
      comparison models. CONCLUSION: The proposed GRU model can learn features from HS 
      directly, which means it can be independent of expert knowledge. In addition, the 
      good performance demonstrates the effectiveness of HS analysis for HF early 
      screening.

AB  - Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals reflect the mechanical activity of the heart. 
      Previous studies have reported that PCG signals contain heart murmurs caused by 
      coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the murmurs caused by CAD are very weak 
      and rarely heard by the human ear. In this paper, a novel feature fusion 
      framework is proposed to provide a comprehensive basis for CAD diagnosis. A 
      dataset containing PCG signals of 175 subjects was collected and used. A total of 
      110 features were extracted from multiple domains, and then reduced and selected. 
      Images obtained by Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were used as the input for 
      the convolutional neural network for feature learning. Then, the selected 
      features and the deep learning features were fused and fed into a multilayer 
      perceptron for classification. The proposed feature fusion method achieved better 
      classification performance than multi-domain features or deep learning features 
      alone, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 90.43%, 93.67%, and 83.36%, 
      respectively. A comparison with existing studies demonstrated that the proposed 
      method was a promising noninvasive screening tool for CAD under general medical 
      conditions.

TI  - A novel multi-branch architecture for state of the art robust detection

AB  - Heart auscultation is an inexpensive and fundamental technique to effectively 
      diagnose cardiovascular disease. However, due to relatively high human error 
      rates even when auscultation is performed by an experienced physician, and due to 
      the not universal availability of qualified personnel, e.g. in developing 
      countries, many efforts are made worldwide to propose computational tools for 
      detecting abnormalities in heart sounds. The large heterogeneity of achievable 
      data quality and devices, the variety of possible heart pathologies, and a 
      generally poor signal-to-noise ratio make this problem very challenging. We 
      present an accurate classification strategy for diagnosing heart sounds based on 
      (1) automatic heart phase segmentation, (2) state-of-the art filters drawn from 
      the field of speech synthesis (mel-frequency cepstral representation) and (3) an 
      ad hoc multi-branch, multi-instance artificial neural network based on 
      convolutional layers and fully connected neuronal ensembles which separately 
      learns from each heart phase hence implicitly leveraging their different 
      physiological significance. We demonstrate that it is possible to train our 
      architecture to reach very high performances, e.g. an area under the curve of 
      0.87 or a sensitivity of 0.97. Our machine-learning-based tool could be employed 
      for heartsound classification, especially as a screening tool in a variety of 
      situations including telemedicine applications. This article is part of the theme 
      issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and 
      opportunities'.

      Heart Sound Classification.
PG  - 1976-1979
LID - 10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629714 [doi]
AB  - Human auscultation has been regarded as a cheap, convenient and efficient method 
      for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, training professional 
      auscultation skills needs tremendous efforts and is time-consuming. Computer 
      audition (CA) that leverages the power of advanced machine learning and signal 
      processing technologies has increasingly attracted contributions to the field of 
      automatic heart sound classification. While previous studies have shown promising 
      results in CA based heart sound classification with the 'shuffle split' method, 
      machine learning for heart sound classification decreases in accuracy with a 
      cross-corpus test dataset. We investigate this problem with a cross-corpus 
      evaluation using the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 Dataset and propose a new 
      combination of data augmentation techniques that leads to a CNN robust for such 
      cross-corpus evaluation. Compared with the baseline, which is given without 
      augmentation, our data augmentation techniques combined improve by 20.0 % the 
      sensitivity and by 7.9 % the specificity on average across 6 databases, which is 
      a significant difference on 4 out of these (p < .05 by one-tailed z-test).

TI  - Detecting Suspected Pump Thrombosis in Left Ventricular Assist Devices via 
      Acoustic Analysis.
PG  - 1899-1906
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2966178 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) fail in up to 10% of patients 
      due to the development of pump thrombosis. Remote monitoring of patients with 
      LVADs can enable early detection and, subsequently, treatment and prevention of 
      pump thrombosis. We assessed whether acoustical signals measured on the chest of 
      patients with LVADs, combined with machine learning algorithms, can be used for 
      detecting pump thrombosis. METHODS: 13 centrifugal pump (HVAD) recipients were 
      enrolled in the study. When hospitalized for suspected pump thrombosis, clinical 
      data and acoustical recordings were obtained at admission, prior to and after 
      administration of thrombolytic therapy, and every 24 hours until laboratory and 
      pump parameters normalized. First, we selected the most important features among 
      our feature set using LDH-based correlation analysis. Then using these features, 
      we trained a logistic regression model and determined our decision threshold to 
      differentiate between thrombosis and non-thrombosis episodes. RESULTS: Accuracy, 
      sensitivity and precision were calculated to be 88.9%, 90.9% and 83.3%, 
      respectively. When tested on the post-thrombolysis data, our algorithm suggested 
      possible pump abnormalities that were not identified by the reference pump power 
      or biomarker abnormalities. SIGNIFICANCE: We showed that the acoustical 
      signatures of LVADs can be an index of mechanical deterioration and, when 
      combined with machine learning algorithms, provide clinical decision support 
      regarding the presence of pump thrombosis.

TI  - A New Method for Heart Disease Detection: Long Short-Term Feature Extraction from 
      Heart Sound Data.
LID - 10.3390/s23135835 [doi]
LID - 5835
AB  - Heart sounds have been extensively studied for heart disease diagnosis for 
      several decades. Traditional machine learning algorithms applied in the 
      literature have typically partitioned heart sounds into small windows and 
      employed feature extraction methods to classify samples. However, as there is no 
      optimal window length that can effectively represent the entire signal, windows 
      may not provide a sufficient representation of the underlying data. To address 
      this issue, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates window-based 
      features with features extracted from the entire signal, thereby improving the 
      overall accuracy of traditional machine learning algorithms. Specifically, 
      feature extraction is carried out using two different time scales. Short-term 
      features are computed from five-second fragments of heart sound instances, 
      whereas long-term features are extracted from the entire signal. The long-term 
      features are combined with the short-term features to create a feature pool known 
      as long short-term features, which is then employed for classification. To 
      evaluate the performance of the proposed method, various traditional machine 
      learning algorithms with various models are applied to the PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge 2016 dataset, which is a collection of diverse heart sound data. The 
      experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction approach 
      increases the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis by nearly 10%.

AB  - Valvular heart diseases (VHD) are one of the major causes of cardiovascular 
      diseases that are having high mortality rates worldwide. The early diagnosis of 
      VHD prevents the development of cardiac diseases and allows for optimum 
      medication. Despite of the ability of current gold standards in identifying VHD, 
      they still lack the required accuracy and thus, several cases go misdiagnosed. In 
      this vein, a study is conducted herein to investigate the efficiency of deep 
      learning models in identifying VHD through phonocardiography (PCG) recordings. 
      PCG heart sounds were obtained from an open-access data-set representing normal 
      heart sounds along with four major VHD; namely aortic stenosis (AS), mitral 
      stenosis (MS), mitral regurgitation (MR), and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). A 
      total of 1,000 patients were involved in the study with 200 recordings for each 
      class. All recordings were initially trimmed to have 9,600 samples ensuring their 
      coverage of at least 1 cardiac cycle. In addition, they were pre-processed by 
      applying maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) smoothing algorithm 
      and z-score normalization. The neural network architecture was designed to reduce 
      the complexity often found in literature and consisted of a combination of 
      convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) based on 
      Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The model was trained and tested 
      following a k-fold cross-validation scheme of 10-folds utilizing the CNN-BiLSTM 
      network as well as the CNN and BiLSTM, individually. The highest performance was 
      achieved using the CNN-BiLSTM network with an overall Cohen's kappa, accuracy, 
      sensitivity, and specificity of 97.87%, 99.32%, 98.30%, and 99.58%, respectively. 
      In addition, the model had an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.998. 
      Furthermore, the performance of the model was assessed on the PhysioNet/Computing 
      in Cardiology 2016 challenge data-set and reached an overall accuracy of 87.31% 
      with an AUC of 0.900. This study paves the way towards implementing deep learning 
      models in VHD identification under clinical settings to assist clinicians in 
      decision making and prevent many cases from cardiac abnormalities development.

LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2021.3137048 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac auscultation is one of the most cost-effective techniques used to detect 
      and identify many heart conditions. Computer-assisted decision systems based on 
      auscultation can support physicians in their decisions. Unfortunately, the 
      application of such systems in clinical trials is still minimal since most of 
      them only aim to detect the presence of extra or abnormal waves in the 
      phonocardiogram signal, i.e., only a binary ground truth variable (normal vs 
      abnormal) is provided. This is mainly due to the lack of large publicly available 
      datasets, where a more detailed description of such abnormal waves (e.g., cardiac 
      murmurs) exists. To pave the way to more effective research on healthcare 
      recommendation systems based on auscultation, our team has prepared the currently 
      largest pediatric heart sound dataset. A total of 5282 recordings have been 
      collected from the four main auscultation locations of 1568 patients, in the 
      process, 215780 heart sounds have been manually annotated. Furthermore, and for 
      the first time, each cardiac murmur has been manually annotated by an expert 
      annotator according to its timing, shape, pitch, grading, and quality. In 
      addition, the auscultation locations where the murmur is present were identified 
      as well as the auscultation location where the murmur is detected more 
      intensively. Such detailed description for a relatively large number of heart 
      sounds may pave the way for new machine learning algorithms with a real-world 
      application for the detection and analysis of murmur waves for diagnostic 
      purposes.

AB  - As cardiovascular disorders are prevalent, there is a growing demand for reliable 
      and precise diagnostic methods within this domain. Audio signal-based heart 
      disease detection is a promising area of research that leverages sound signals 
      generated by the heart to identify and diagnose cardiovascular disorders. Machine 
      learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are pivotal in classifying and 
      identifying heart disease from audio signals. This study investigates ML and DL 
      techniques to detect heart disease by analyzing noisy sound signals. This study 
      employed two subsets of datasets from the PASCAL CHALLENGE having real heart 
      audios. The research process and visually depict signals using spectrograms and 
      Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). We employ data augmentation to 
      improve the model's performance by introducing synthetic noise to the heart sound 
      signals. In addition, a feature ensembler is developed to integrate various audio 
      feature extraction techniques. Several machine learning and deep learning 
      classifiers are utilized for heart disease detection. Among the numerous models 
      studied and previous study findings, the multilayer perceptron model performed 
      best, with an accuracy rate of 95.65%. This study demonstrates the potential of 
      this methodology in accurately detecting heart disease from sound signals. These 
      findings present promising opportunities for enhancing medical diagnosis and 
      patient care.

      Case Study.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease, particularly Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), is one of the 
      leading causes of death in many developing countries. RHD is manageable and 
      treatable with early detection. However, multiple countries across the globe 
      suffer from a scarcity of experienced physicians who can perform screening at 
      large scales. Advancements in machine learning and signal processing have paved 
      way for Phonocardiogram (PCG)-based automatic heart sound classification. The 
      direct implication of such methods is that it is possible to enable a person 
      without specialized training to detect potential cardiac conditions with just a 
      digital stethoscope. Hospitalization or life-threatening situations can be 
      dramatically reduced via such early screenings. Towards this, we conducted a case 
      study amongst a population from a particular geography using machine learning and 
      deep learning methods for the detection of murmur in heart sounds. The 
      methodology consists of first pre-processing and identifying normal vs. abnormal 
      heart sound signals using 3 state-of-the-art methods. The second step further 
      identifies the murmur to be systolic or diastolic by capturing the auscultation 
      location. Abnormal findings are then sent for early attention of clinicians for 
      proper diagnosis. The case study investigates the efficacy of the automated 
      method employed for early screening of potential RHD and initial encouraging 
      results of the study are presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular diseases are critical diseases and need 
      to be diagnosed as early as possible. There is a lack of medical professionals in 
      remote areas to diagnose these diseases. Artificial intelligence-based automatic 
      diagnostic tools can help to diagnose cardiac diseases. This work presents an 
      automatic classification method using machine learning to diagnose multiple 
      cardiac diseases from phonocardiogram signals. METHODS: The proposed system 
      involves a convolutional neural network (CNN) model because of its high accuracy 
      and robustness to automatically diagnose the cardiac disorders from the heart 
      sounds. To improve the accuracy in a noisy environment and make the method 
      robust, the proposed method has used data augmentation techniques for training 
      and multi-classification of multiple cardiac diseases. RESULTS: The model has 
      been validated both heart sound data and augmented data using n-fold 
      cross-validation. Results of all fold have been shown reported in this work. The 
      model has achieved accuracy on the test set up to 98.60% to diagnose multiple 
      cardiac diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model can be ported to any computing 
      devices like computers, single board computing processors, android handheld 
      devices etc. To make a stand-alone diagnostic tool that may be of help in remote 
      primary health care centres. The proposed method is non-invasive, efficient, 
      robust, and has low time complexity making it suitable for real-time 
      applications.

TI  - Automated Identification of Innocent Still's Murmur in Children.
PG  - 1326-1334
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2016.2603787 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Still's murmur is the most common innocent heart murmur in children. 
      It is also the most commonly misdiagnosed murmur, resulting in a high number of 
      unnecessary referrals to pediatric cardiologist. The purpose of this study was to 
      develop a computer algorithm for automated identification of Still's murmur that 
      may help reduce unnecessary referrals. METHODS: We first developed an accurate 
      segmentation algorithm to locate the first and the second heart sounds. Once 
      these sounds were identified, we extracted signal features specific to Still's 
      murmur. Subsequently, machine learning-based classifiers, artificial neural 
      network and support vector machine, were used to identify Still's murmur. 
      RESULTS: We evaluated our classifiers using the jackknife method using 87 Still's 
      murmurs and 170 non-Still's murmurs. Our algorithm identified Still's murmur 
      accurately with 84-93% sensitivity and 91-99% specificity. CONCLUSION: We have 
      achieved accurate automated identification of Still's murmur while minimizing 
      false positives. The performance of our algorithm is comparable to the rate of 
      murmur identification by auscultation by pediatric cardiologists. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      To our knowledge, our solution is the first murmur classifier that focuses 
      singularly on Still's murmur. Following further refinement and testing, the 
      presented algorithm could reduce the number of children with Still's murmur 
      referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists.

TI  - Audio for Audio is Better? An Investigation on Transfer Learning Models for Heart 
      Sound Classification.
PG  - 74-77
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175450 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading factors for death cause of human 
      beings. In the past decade, heart sound classification has been increasingly 
      studied for its feasibility to develop a non-invasive approach to monitor a 
      subject's health status. Particularly, relevant studies have benefited from the 
      fast development of wearable devices and machine learning techniques. 
      Nevertheless, finding and designing efficient acoustic properties from heart 
      sounds is an expensive and time-consuming task. It is known that transfer 
      learning methods can help extract higher representations automatically from the 
      heart sounds without any human domain knowledge. However, most existing studies 
      are based on models pre-trained on images, which may not fully represent the 
      characteristics inherited from audio. To this end, we propose a novel transfer 
      learning model pre-trained on large scale audio data for a heart sound 
      classification task. In this study, the PhysioNet CinC Challenge Dataset is used 
      for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed pre-trained 
      audio models can outperform other popular models pre-trained by images by 
      achieving the highest unweighted average recall at 89.7 %.

PG  - 418-430
LID - 10.1080/03091902.2019.1688408 [doi]
AB  - Heart sound and its recorded signal which is known as phonocardiograph (PCG) are 
      one of the most important biosignals that can be used to diagnose cardiac 
      diseases alongside electrocardiogram (ECG). Over the past few years, the use of 
      PCG signals has become more widespread and researchers pay their attention to it 
      and aim to provide an automated heart sound analysis and classification system 
      that supports medical professionals in their decision. In this paper, a new 
      method for heart sound features extraction for the classification of 
      non-segmented signals using instantaneous frequency was proposed. The method has 
      two major phases: the first phase is to estimate the instantaneous frequency of 
      the recorded signal; the second phase is to extract a set of eleven features from 
      the estimated instantaneous frequency. The method was tested into two different 
      datasets, one for binary classification (Normal and Abnormal) and the other for 
      multi-classification (Five Classes) to ensure the robustness of the extracted 
      features. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision for 
      binary classification and multi-classification were all above 95% using both 
      random forest and KNN classifiers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of machine learning to cardiac auscultation has the 
      potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both routine and 
      point-of-care screenings. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) on heart 
      sound spectrograms in particular has defined state-of-the-art performance. 
      However, the relative paucity of patient data remains a significant barrier to 
      creating models that can adapt to a wide range of potential variability. To that 
      end, we examined a CNN model's performance on automated heart sound 
      classification, before and after various forms of data augmentation, and aimed to 
      identify the most optimal augmentation methods for cardiac spectrogram analysis. 
      RESULTS: We built a standard CNN model to classify cardiac sound recordings as 
      either normal or abnormal. The baseline control model achieved a PR AUC of 
      0.763 ± 0.047. Among the single data augmentation techniques explored, horizontal 
      flipping of the spectrogram image improved the model performance the most, with a 
      PR AUC of 0.819 ± 0.044. Principal component analysis color augmentation (PCA) 
      and perturbations of saturation-value (SV) of the hue-saturation-value (HSV) 
      color scale achieved a PR AUC of 0.779 ± 045 and 0.784 ± 0.037, respectively. 
      Time and frequency masking resulted in a PR AUC of 0.772 ± 0.050. Pitch shifting, 
      time stretching and compressing, noise injection, vertical flipping, and applying 
      random color filters negatively impacted model performance. Concatenating the 
      best performing data augmentation technique (horizontal flip) with PCA and SV 
      perturbations improved model performance. CONCLUSION: Data augmentation can 
      improve classification accuracy by expanding and diversifying the dataset, which 
      protects against overfitting to random variance. However, data augmentation is 
      necessarily domain specific. For example, methods like noise injection have found 
      success in other areas of automated sound classification, but in the context of 
      cardiac sound analysis, noise injection can mimic the presence of murmurs and 
      worsen model performance. Thus, care should be taken to ensure clinically 
      appropriate forms of data augmentation to avoid negatively impacting model 
      performance.

TI  - An Automatic Approach Using ELM Classifier for HFpEF Identification Based on 
      Heart Sound Characteristics.
PG  - 285
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1415-1 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex and 
      heterogeneous clinical syndrome. For the purpose of assisting HFpEF diagnosis, a 
      non-invasive method using extreme learning machine and heart sound (HS) 
      characteristics was provided in this paper. Firstly, the improved wavelet 
      denoising method was used for signal preprocessing. Then, the logistic regression 
      based hidden semi-Markov model algorithm was utilized to locate the boundary of 
      the first HS and the second HS, therefore, the ratio of diastolic to systolic 
      duration can be calculated. Eleven features were extracted based on multifractal 
      detrended fluctuation analysis to analyze the differences of multifractal 
      behavior of HS between healthy people and HFpEF patients. Afterwards, the 
      statistical analysis was implemented on the extracted HS characteristics to 
      generate the diagnostic feature set. Finally, the extreme learning machine was 
      applied for HFpEF identification by the comparison of performances with support 
      vector machine. The result shows an accuracy of 96.32%, a sensitivity of 95.48% 
      and a specificity of 97.10%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of HS for HFpEF 
      diagnosis.

AB  - Developing new treatments for emerging infectious diseases in infectious and 
      noninfectious diseases has attracted a particular attention. The emergence of 
      viral diseases is expected to accelerate; these data indicate the need for a 
      proactive approach to develop widely active family specific and cross family 
      therapies for future disease outbreaks. Viral disease such as pneumonia, severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome type 2, HIV infection, and Hepatitis-C virus can cause 
      directly and indirectly cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emphasis should be placed 
      not only on the development of broad-spectrum molecules and antibodies but also 
      on host factor therapy, including the reutilization of previously approved or 
      developing drugs. Another new class of therapeutics with great antiviral 
      therapeutic potential is molecular communication networks using deep learning 
      autoencoder (DL-AEs). The use of DL-AEs for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of 
      infectious and noninfectious diseases has attracted a particular attention. MCN 
      is map to molecular signaling and communication that are found inside and outside 
      the human body where the goal is to develop a new black box mechanism that can 
      serve the future robust healthcare industry (HCI). MCN has the ability to 
      characterize the signaling process between cells and infectious disease locations 
      at various levels of the human body called point-to-point MCN through DL-AE and 
      provide targeted drug delivery (TDD) environment. Through MCN, and DL-AE 
      healthcare provider can remotely measure biological signals and control certain 
      processes in the required organism for the maintenance of the patient's health 
      state. We use biomicrodevices to promote the real-time monitoring of human health 
      and storage of the gathered data in the cloud. In this paper, we use the DL-based 
      AE approach to design and implement a new drug source and target for the MCN 
      under white Gaussian noise. Simulation results show that transceiver executions 
      for a given medium model that reduces the bit error rate which can be learned. 
      Then, next development of molecular diagnosis such as heart sounds is classified. 
      Furthermore, biohealth interface for the inside and outside human body mechanism 
      is presented, comparative perspective with up-to-date current situation about 
      MCN.

TI  - Heart Sound Abnormality Detection From Multi-Institutional Collaboration: 
      Introducing a Federated Learning Framework.
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2024.3393557 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial task in 
      medical practice. With the application of computer audition in the healthcare 
      field, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to clinical non-invasive 
      intelligent auscultation of heart sounds to provide rapid and effective 
      pre-screening. However, AI models generally require large amounts of data which 
      may cause privacy issues. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect large amounts 
      of healthcare data from a single centre. METHODS: In this study, we propose 
      federated learning (FL) optimisation strategies for the practical application in 
      multi-centre institutional heart sound databases. The horizontal FL is mainly 
      employed to tackle the privacy problem by aligning the feature spaces of FL 
      participating institutions without information leakage. In addition, techniques 
      based on deep learning have poor interpretability due to their "black-box" 
      property, which limits the feasibility of AI in real medical data. To this end, 
      vertical FL is utilised to address the issues of model interpretability and data 
      scarcity. CONCLUSION: Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed FL 
      framework can achieve good performance for heart sound abnormality detection by 
      taking the personal privacy protection into account. Moreover, using the 
      federated feature space is beneficial to balance the interpretability of the 
      vertical FL and the privacy of the data. SIGNIFICANCE: This work realises the 
      potential of FL from research to clinical practice, and is expected to have 
      extensive application in the federated smart medical system.

TI  - ZCHSound: Open-Source ZJU Paediatric Heart Sound Database With Congenital Heart 
      Disease.
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2023.3348800 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common birth defect in children. 
      Intelligent auscultation algorithms have been proven to reduce the subjectivity 
      of diagnoses and alleviate the workload of doctors. However, the development of 
      this algorithm has been limited by the lack of reliable, standardized, and 
      publicly available pediatric heart sound databases. Therefore, the objective of 
      this research is to develop a large-scale, high-standard, high-quality, and 
      accurately labeled pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD) heart sound database, 
      and perform classification tasks to evaluate its performance, filling this 
      important research gap. METHOD: From 2020 to 2022, we collaborated with 
      experienced cardiac surgeons from Zhejiang University Children's Hospital to 
      collect heart sound signals from 1259 participants using electronic stethoscopes. 
      To ensure accurate disease diagnosis, the cardiac ultrasound images for each 
      participant were acquired by an experienced ultrasonographer, and the final 
      diagnosis was confirmed through the consensus of two cardiac experts or cardiac 
      surgeons. To establish the benchmark of ZCHSound, we extracted 84 time-frequency 
      features from the heart sounds and evaluated the performance of the 
      classification task using machine learning models. Additionally, we evaluated the 
      importance scores of the 84 features in distinguishing between normal and 
      pathological heart sounds in children using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) 
      values. RESULTS: The ZCHSound database contains heart sound data from 1259 
      participants, with all data divided into two datasets: one is a high-quality, 
      filtered clean heart sound dataset, and the other is a low-quality, noisy heart 
      sound dataset. In the evaluation of the high-quality dataset, our random forest 
      ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 90.3% in the classification task of normal 
      and pathological heart sounds. Moreover, the SHAP analysis results demonstrate 
      that frequency-domain features have a more significant impact on the model output 
      compared to time-domain features. Features related to the cardiac diastolic 
      period have a greater influence on the model's classification results compared to 
      those related to the systolic period. CONCLUSION: This study has successfully 
      established a large-scale, high-quality, rigorously standardized pediatric CHD 
      sound database with precise disease diagnosis. This database not only provides 
      important learning resources for clinical doctors in auscultation knowledge but 
      also offers valuable data support for algorithm engineers in developing 
      intelligent auscultation algorithms. Our data can be accessed and downloaded by 
      the public at http://zchsound.ncrcch.org.cn/.

TI  - HBNET: A blended ensemble model for the detection of cardiovascular anomalies 
      using phonocardiogram.
LID - 10.3233/THC-231290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac diseases are highly detrimental illnesses, responsible for 
      approximately 32% of global mortality [1]. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment 
      can reduce deaths caused by cardiac diseases. In paediatric patients, it is 
      challenging for paediatricians to identify functional murmurs and pathological 
      murmurs from heart sounds. OBJECTIVE: The study intends to develop a novel 
      blended ensemble model using hybrid deep learning models and softmax regression 
      to classify adult, and paediatric heart sounds into five distinct classes, 
      distinguishing itself as a groundbreaking work in this domain. Furthermore, the 
      research aims to create a comprehensive 5-class paediatric phonocardiogram (PCG) 
      dataset. The dataset includes two critical pathological classes, namely atrial 
      septal defects and ventricular septal defects, along with functional murmurs, 
      pathological and normal heart sounds. METHODS: The work proposes a blended 
      ensemble model (HbNet-Heartbeat Network) comprising two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM 
      and CNN-LSTM, as base models and Softmax regression as meta-learner. HbNet 
      leverages the strengths of base models and improves the overall PCG 
      classification accuracy. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) capture the 
      crucial audio signal characteristics relevant to the classification. The 
      amalgamation of these two deep learning structures enhances the precision and 
      reliability of PCG classification, leading to improved diagnostic results. 
      RESULTS: The HbNet model exhibited excellent results with an average accuracy of 
      99.72% and sensitivity of 99.3% on an adult dataset, surpassing all the existing 
      state-of-the-art works. The researchers have validated the reliability of the 
      HbNet model by testing it on a real-time paediatric dataset. The paediatric 
      model's accuracy is 86.5%. HbNet detected functional murmur with 100% precision. 
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the HbNet model exhibits a high level of 
      efficacy in the early detection of cardiac disorders. Results also imply that 
      HbNet has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for the development of 
      decision-support systems that aid medical practitioners in confirming their 
      diagnoses. This method makes it easier for medical professionals to diagnose and 
      initiate prompt treatment while performing preliminary auscultation and reduces 
      unnecessary echocardiograms.

TI  - Towards Domain Invariant Heart Sound Abnormality Detection Using Learnable 
      Filterbanks.
PG  - 2189-2198

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiac auscultation is the most practiced non-invasive and 
      cost-effective procedure for the early diagnosis of heart diseases. While machine 
      learning based systems can aid in automatically screening patients, the 
      robustness of these systems is affected by numerous factors including the 
      stethoscope/sensor, environment, and data collection protocol. This article 
      studies the adverse effect of domain variability on heart sound abnormality 
      detection and develops strategies to address this problem. METHODS: We propose a 
      novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer, consisting of time-convolutional 
      (tConv) units, that emulate Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. The filter 
      coefficients can be updated via backpropagation and be stacked in the front-end 
      of the network as a learnable filterbank. RESULTS: On publicly available 
      multi-domain datasets, the proposed method surpasses the top-scoring systems 
      found in the literature for heart sound abnormality detection (a binary 
      classification task). We utilized sensitivity, specificity, F-1 score and Macc 
      (average of sensitivity and specificity) as performance metrics. Our systems 
      achieved relative improvements of up to 11.84% in terms of MAcc, compared to 
      state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the effectiveness 
      of the proposed learnable filterbank CNN architecture in achieving robustness 
      towards sensor/domain variability in PCG signals. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed 
      methods pave the way for deploying automated cardiac screening systems in 
      diversified and underserved communities.

TI  - Phonocardiogram Signal Processing for Automatic Diagnosis of Congenital Heart 
      Disorders through Fusion of Temporal and Cepstral Features.
LID - 10.3390/s20133790 [doi]
LID - 3790
AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a heart disorder associated with the 
      devastating indications that result in increased mortality, increased morbidity, 
      increased healthcare expenditure, and decreased quality of life. Ventricular 
      Septal Defects (VSDs) and Arterial Septal Defects (ASDs) are the most common 
      types of CHD. CHDs can be controlled before reaching a serious phase with an 
      early diagnosis. The phonocardiogram (PCG) or heart sound auscultation is a 
      simple and non-invasive technique that may reveal obvious variations of different 
      CHDs. Diagnosis based on heart sounds is difficult and requires a high level of 
      medical training and skills due to human hearing limitations and the 
      non-stationary nature of PCGs. An automated computer-aided system may boost the 
      diagnostic objectivity and consistency of PCG signals in the detection of CHDs. 
      The objective of this research was to assess the effects of various pattern 
      recognition modalities for the design of an automated system that effectively 
      differentiates normal, ASD, and VSD categories using short term PCG time series. 
      The proposed model in this study adopts three-stage processing: pre-processing, 
      feature extraction, and classification. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was 
      used to denoise the raw PCG signals acquired from subjects. One-dimensional local 
      ternary patterns (1D-LTPs) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were 
      extracted from the denoised PCG signal for precise representation of data from 
      different classes. In the final stage, the fused feature vector of 1D-LTPs and 
      MFCCs was fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using 10-fold 
      cross-validation. The PCG signals were acquired from the subjects admitted to 
      local hospitals and classified by applying various experiments. The proposed 
      methodology achieves a mean accuracy of 95.24% in classifying ASD, VSD, and 
      normal subjects. The proposed model can be put into practice and serve as a 
      second opinion for cardiologists by providing more objective and faster 
      interpretations of PCG signals.

AB  - Deregulated splicing machinery components have shown to be associated with the 
      development of several types of cancer and, therefore, the determination of such 
      alterations can help the development of tumor-specific molecular targets for 
      early prognosis and therapy. Determining such splicing components, however, is 
      not a straightforward task mainly due to the heterogeneity of tumors, the 
      variability across samples, and the fat-short characteristic of genomic datasets. 
      In this work, a supervised machine learning-based methodology is proposed, 
      allowing the determination of subsets of relevant splicing components that best 
      discriminate samples. The methodology comprises three main phases: first, a 
      ranking of features is determined by means of applying feature weighting 
      algorithms that compute the importance of each splicing component; second, the 
      best subset of features that allows the induction of an accurate classifier is 
      determined by means of conducting an effective heuristic search; then the 
      confidence over the induced classifier is assessed by means of explaining the 
      individual predictions and its global behavior. At the end, an extensive 
      experimental study was conducted on a large collection of transcript-based 
      datasets, illustrating the utility and benefit of the proposed methodology for 
      analyzing dysregulation in splicing machinery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Most of the existing machine learning-based heart sound 
      classification methods achieve limited accuracy. Since they primarily depend on 
      single domain feature information and tend to focus equally on each part of the 
      signal rather than employing a selective attention mechanism. In addition, they 
      fail to exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) - based features with an 
      effective fusion strategy. METHODS: In order to overcome these limitations, a 
      novel multimodal attention convolutional neural network (MACNN) with a 
      feature-level fusion strategy, in which Mel-cepstral domain as well as general 
      frequency domain features are incorporated to increase the diversity of the 
      features, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, DilationAttenNet is 
      first utilized to construct attention-based CNN feature extractors and then these 
      feature extractors are jointly optimized in MACNN at the feature-level. The 
      attention mechanism aims to suppress irrelevant information and focus on crucial 
      diverse features extracted from the CNN. RESULTS: Extensive experiments are 
      carried out to study the efficacy of the feature level fusion in comparison to 
      that with early fusion. The results show that the proposed MACNN method 
      significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy 
      and score for the two publicly available Github and Physionet datasets. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of our experiments demonstrated the high performance for 
      heart sound classification based on the proposed MACNN, and hence have potential 
      clinical usefulness in the identification of heart diseases. This technique can 
      assist cardiologists and researchers in the design and development of heart sound 
      classification methods.

LID - 1893
AB  - Our aim is to contribute to the classification of anomalous patterns in 
      biosignals using this novel approach. We specifically focus on melanoma and heart 
      murmurs. We use a comparative study of two convolution networks in the Complex 
      and Real numerical domains. The idea is to obtain a powerful approach for 
      building portable systems for early disease detection. Two similar algorithmic 
      structures were chosen so that there is no bias determined by the number of 
      parameters to train. Three clinical data sets, ISIC2017, PH2, and Pascal, were 
      used to carry out the experiments. Mean comparison hypothesis tests were 
      performed to ensure statistical objectivity in the conclusions. In all cases, 
      complex-valued networks presented a superior performance for the Precision, 
      Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and Specificity metrics in the detection of 
      associated anomalies. The best complex number-based classifier obtained in the 
      Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space presents a Euclidean distance of 
      0.26127 with respect to the ideal classifier, as opposed to the best real 
      number-based classifier, whose Euclidean distance to the ideal is 0.36022 for the 
      same task of melanoma detection. The 27.46% superiority in this metric, as in the 
      others reported in this work, suggests that complex-valued networks have a 
      greater ability to extract features for more efficient discrimination in the 
      dataset.

AB  - Objective of this study is to introduce a secure IoHT system, which acts as a 
      clinical decision support system with the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. 
      In this sense, it was emphasized that the accuracy rate of diagnosis 
      (classification) can be improved via deep learning algorithms, by needing no 
      hybrid-complex models, and a secure data processing can be achieved with a 
      multi-authentication and Tangle based approach. In detail, heart sounds were 
      classified with Autoencoder Neural Networks (AEN) and the IoHT system was built 
      for supporting doctors in real-time. For developing the diagnosis infrastructure 
      by the AEN, PASCAL B-Training and Physiobank-PhysioNet A-Training heart sound 
      datasets were used accordingly. For the PASCAL dataset, the AEN provided a 
      diagnosis-classification performance with the accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 
      100%, and the specificity of 100% whereas the rates were respectively 99.8%, 
      99.65%, and 99.13% for the PhysioNet dataset. It was seen that the findings by 
      the developed AEN based solution were better than the alternative solutions from 
      the literature. Additionally, usability of the whole IoHT system was found 
      positive by the doctors, and according to the 479 real-case applications, the 
      system was able to achieve accuracy rates of 96.03% for normal heart sounds, 
      91.91% for extrasystole, and 90.11% for murmur. In terms of security approach, 
      the system was also robust against several attacking methods including synthetic 
      data impute as well as trying to penetrating to the system via central system or 
      mobile devices.

TI  - A Decision Support System for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis Based on Machine Learning 
      Methods.
PG  - 43-47
AB  - This paper proposes a decision support system for screening pediatric cardiac 
      disease in primary healthcare centres relying on the heart sound time series 
      analysis. The proposed system employs our processing method which is based on the 
      hidden Markov model for extracting appropriate information from the time series. 
      The binary output resulting from the method is discriminative for the two classes 
      of time series existing in our databank, corresponding to the children with heart 
      disease and the healthy ones. A total 90 children referrals to a university 
      hospital, constituting of 55 healthy and 35 children with congenital heart 
      disease, were enrolled into the study after obtaining the informed consent. 
      Accuracy and sensitivity of the method was estimated to be 86.4% and 85.6%, 
      respectively, showing a superior performance than what a paediatric cardiologist 
      could achieve performing auscultation. The method can be easily implemented using 
      mobile and web technology to develop an easy-to-use tool for paediatric cardiac 
      disease diagnosis.

TI  - Detection of Coronary Artery Disease Based on Clinical Phonocardiogram and 
      Multiscale Attention Convolutional Compression Network.
PG  - 1353-1362

AB  - Heart sound is an important physiological signal that contains rich pathological 
      information related with coronary stenosis. Thus, some machine learning methods 
      are developed to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) based on phonocardiogram 
      (PCG). However, current methods lack sufficient clinical dataset and fail to 
      achieve efficient feature utilization. Besides, the methods require complex 
      processing steps including empirical feature extraction and classifier design. To 
      achieve efficient CAD detection, we propose the multiscale attention 
      convolutional compression network (MACCN) based on clinical PCG dataset. Firstly, 
      PCG dataset including 102 CAD subjects and 82 non-CAD subjects was established. 
      Then, a multiscale convolution structure was developed to catch comprehensive 
      heart sound features and a channel attention module was developed to enhance key 
      features in multiscale attention convolutional block (MACB). Finally, a separate 
      downsampling block was proposed to reduce feature losses. MACCN combining the 
      blocks can automatically extract features without empirical and manual feature 
      selection. It obtains good classification results with accuracy 93.43%, 
      sensitivity 93.44%, precision 93.48%, and F1 score 93.42%. The study implies that 
      MACCN performs effective PCG feature mining aiming for CAD detection. Further, it 
      integrates feature extraction and classification and provides a simplified PCG 
      processing case.

TI  - [Research on bark-frequency spectral coefficients heart sound classification 
      algorithm based on multiple window time-frequency reassignment].
PG  - 51-59
LID - 10.7507/1001-5515.202212037 [doi]
AB  - The multi-window time-frequency reassignment helps to improve the time-frequency 
      resolution of bark-frequency spectral coefficient (BFSC) analysis of heart 
      sounds. For this purpose, a new heart sound classification algorithm combining 
      feature extraction based on multi-window time-frequency reassignment BFSC with 
      deep learning was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the randomly intercepted heart 
      sound segments are preprocessed with amplitude normalization, the heart sounds 
      were framed and time-frequency rearrangement based on short-time Fourier 
      transforms were computed using multiple orthogonal windows. A smooth spectrum 
      estimate is calculated by arithmetic averaging each of the obtained independent 
      spectra. Finally, the BFSC of reassignment spectrum is extracted as a feature by 
      the Bark filter bank. In this paper, convolutional network and recurrent neural 
      network are used as classifiers for model comparison and performance evaluation 
      of the extracted features. Eventually, the multi-window time-frequency 
      rearrangement improved BFSC method extracts more discriminative features, with a 
      binary classification accuracy of 0.936, a sensitivity of 0.946, and a 
      specificity of 0.922. These results present that the algorithm proposed in this 
      paper does not need to segment the heart sounds and randomly intercepts the heart 
      sound segments, which greatly simplifies the computational process and is 
      expected to be used for screening of congenital heart disease.

AB  - Elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is a significant healthcare risk. 
      Continuous monitoring for patients with elevated PAP is crucial for effective 
      treatment, yet the most accurate method is invasive and expensive, and cannot be 
      performed repeatedly. Noninvasive methods exist but are somewhat inaccurate, 
      expensive, and cannot be used for continuous monitoring. We present a machine 
      learning model based on heart sounds that estimates pulmonary artery pressure 
      with enough accuracy to exclude an invasive diagnostic operation, allowing for 
      consistent monitoring of heart condition in suspect patients without the cost and 
      risk of invasive monitoring. We conduct a greedy search through 38 possible 
      features using a 109-patient cross-validation to find the most predictive 
      features. Our best general model has a standard estimate of error (SEE) of 
      8.3mmHg, which outperforms the previous best performance in the literature on a 
      general set of unseen patient data.
