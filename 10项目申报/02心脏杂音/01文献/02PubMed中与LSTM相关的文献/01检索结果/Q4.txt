TI  - HBNET: A blended ensemble model for the detection of cardiovascular anomalies 
      using phonocardiogram.
LID - 10.3233/THC-231290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac diseases are highly detrimental illnesses, responsible for 
      approximately 32% of global mortality [1]. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment 
      can reduce deaths caused by cardiac diseases. In paediatric patients, it is 
      challenging for paediatricians to identify functional murmurs and pathological 
      murmurs from heart sounds. OBJECTIVE: The study intends to develop a novel 
      blended ensemble model using hybrid deep learning models and softmax regression 
      to classify adult, and paediatric heart sounds into five distinct classes, 
      distinguishing itself as a groundbreaking work in this domain. Furthermore, the 
      research aims to create a comprehensive 5-class paediatric phonocardiogram (PCG) 
      dataset. The dataset includes two critical pathological classes, namely atrial 
      septal defects and ventricular septal defects, along with functional murmurs, 
      pathological and normal heart sounds. METHODS: The work proposes a blended 
      ensemble model (HbNet-Heartbeat Network) comprising two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM 
      and CNN-LSTM, as base models and Softmax regression as meta-learner. HbNet 
      leverages the strengths of base models and improves the overall PCG 
      classification accuracy. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) capture the 
      crucial audio signal characteristics relevant to the classification. The 
      amalgamation of these two deep learning structures enhances the precision and 
      reliability of PCG classification, leading to improved diagnostic results. 
      RESULTS: The HbNet model exhibited excellent results with an average accuracy of 
      99.72% and sensitivity of 99.3% on an adult dataset, surpassing all the existing 
      state-of-the-art works. The researchers have validated the reliability of the 
      HbNet model by testing it on a real-time paediatric dataset. The paediatric 
      model's accuracy is 86.5%. HbNet detected functional murmur with 100% precision. 
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the HbNet model exhibits a high level of 
      efficacy in the early detection of cardiac disorders. Results also imply that 
      HbNet has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for the development of 
      decision-support systems that aid medical practitioners in confirming their 
      diagnoses. This method makes it easier for medical professionals to diagnose and 
      initiate prompt treatment while performing preliminary auscultation and reduces 
      unnecessary echocardiograms.
