### About Dataset
#### Context
This dataset was originally for a machine learning challenge to classify heart beat sounds. The data was gathered from two sources: (A) from the general public via the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app, and (B) from a clinic trial in hospitals using the digital stethoscope DigiScope. There were two challenges associated with this competition:

##### 1. Heart Sound Segmentation
The first challenge is to produce a method that can locate S1(lub) and S2(dub) sounds within audio data, segmenting the Normal audio files in both datasets.

##### 2. Heart Sound Classification
The task is to produce a method that can classify real heart audio (also known as “beat classification”) into one of four categories.

#### Content
The dataset is split into two sources, **A** and **B**:

* **set_a.csv** - Labels and metadata for heart beats collected from the general public via an iPhone app

* **set_a_timing.csv** - contains gold-standard timing information for the "normal" recordings from Set A.

* **set_b.csv** - Labels and metadata for heart beats collected from a clinical trial in hospitals using a digital stethoscope

* **audio files** - Varying lengths, between 1 second and 30 seconds. (some have been clipped to reduce excessive noise and provide the salient fragment of the sound).

### About Dataset

#### Context
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

#### Content
Attribute Information:


1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
