### About Dataset

#### Context
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

#### Content

1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
