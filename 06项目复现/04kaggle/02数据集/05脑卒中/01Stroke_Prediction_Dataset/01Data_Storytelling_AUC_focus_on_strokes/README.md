## 1. Introduction
Do you know, 80% Heart strokes are preventable?, yes they are. In this notebook, we attempted to visulize some key indicators that lead to heart strokes. Here data is sampled from a wide range of age groups, gender, habits and health related issues. Most of the visualizations are self expilantory and try to stick to simple visualization but effiective method to convey most of the information.


### Problem Statement
Visululize the relationships between various Healthy and Unhealthy habits to Heart Strokes, and there by predict the stroke probability with best model and hypertuned parameters.

### Questions and Assumptions
* 1. Does age has impact on strokes? and How is this parameter distributed?
* 2. Does body mass index and glucose levels in a person, propel a heart stroke?
* 3. Assumption: Smoking can induce Stroke, is it true?
* 4. Assumption: Heart with a Heart Disease is prone to Stroke, is it true?
* 5. Assumption: Workload results in high blood pressure and that could lead to Stroke, is it true?
* 6. Assumption: Males are most susceptible to strokes due to high work related stress, is it true?
* 7. Relationship between continous and categorical data
* 8. Feature importance and Feature Selection for accurate predictions
