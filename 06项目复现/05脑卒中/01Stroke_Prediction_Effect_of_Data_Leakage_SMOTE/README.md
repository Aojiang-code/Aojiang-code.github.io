## 0. 简介
### 0.1. Problem Statement :

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. It is another health issue that has found to be rising throughout the world due to the adoption of lifestyle changes that disregards healthy lifestyle & good eating habits. Thus, new emerging electronic devices that record the health vitals have paved the way for creating an automated solution with AI techniques at it's core. Thus, similar to heart diseases, efforts have begun to create lab tests that predict stroke. The dataset presented here has many factors that highlight the lifestyle of the patients and hence gives us an opportunity to create an AI-based solution for it.
