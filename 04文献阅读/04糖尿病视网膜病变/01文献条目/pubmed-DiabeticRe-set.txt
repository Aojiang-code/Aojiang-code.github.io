AB  - IMPORTANCE: Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an 
      algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that 
      demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. 
      Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and 
      validation. OBJECTIVE: To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for 
      automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal 
      fundus photographs. DESIGN AND SETTING: A specific type of neural network 
      optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was 
      trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, 
      which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, 
      and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and 
      ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant 
      algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, 
      both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high 
      intragrader consistency. EXPOSURE: Deep learning-trained algorithm. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting 
      referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic 
      retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on 
      the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The 
      algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, 
      one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity. RESULTS: The 
      EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 
      years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); 
      the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 
      42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For 
      detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 
      0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for 
      Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for 
      EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity 
      was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% 
      CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a 
      second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for 
      EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 
      the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an 
      algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for 
      detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to 
      determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and 
      to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and 
      outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Deep Learning System for Diabetic Retinopathy and 
      Related Eye Diseases Using Retinal Images From Multiethnic Populations With 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 2211-2223
LID - 10.1001/jama.2017.18152 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: A deep learning system (DLS) is a machine learning technology with 
      potential for screening diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the performance of a DLS in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, 
      vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, possible glaucoma, and age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD) in community and clinic-based multiethnic populations 
      with diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic performance of a DLS 
      for diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases was evaluated using 494 661 
      retinal images. A DLS was trained for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 
      76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125 189 images), and AMD (72 610 images), and 
      performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 
      112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71 896 images), and AMD (35 948 images). 
      Training of the DLS was completed in May 2016, and validation of the DLS was 
      completed in May 2017 for detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate 
      nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) and vision-threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) using a 
      primary validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes. EXPOSURES: Use of a 
      deep learning system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS 
      with professional graders (retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, trained 
      graders, or optometrists) as the reference standard. RESULTS: In the primary 
      validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896 images; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [2.2] 
      years; 54.6% men), the prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy was 3.0%; 
      vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, 0.6%; possible glaucoma, 0.1%; and AMD, 
      2.5%. The AUC of the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95% CI, 
      0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5% (95% CI, 87.3%-93.0%), and specificity was 
      91.6% (95% CI, 91.0%-92.2%). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 
      0.958 (95% CI, 0.956-0.961), sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100.0%), and 
      specificity was 91.1% (95% CI, 90.7%-91.4%). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 
      (95% CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.9%), and 
      specificity was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.8%-87.5%). For AMD, AUC was 0.931 (95% CI, 
      0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%), and specificity was 
      88.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-89.0%). For referable diabetic retinopathy in the 10 
      additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889 to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic 
      cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitivity and specificity 
      for identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. Further research 
      is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the DLS in health care settings and 
      the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness 
      worldwide. Since DR was first recognized as an important complication of 
      diabetes, there have been many attempts to accurately classify the severity and 
      stages of disease. These historical classification systems evolved as 
      understanding of disease pathophysiology improved, methods of imaging and 
      assessing DR changed, and effective treatments were developed. Current DR 
      classification systems are effective, and have been the basis of major research 
      trials and clinical management guidelines for decades. However, with further new 
      developments such as recognition of diabetic retinal neurodegeneration, new 
      imaging platforms such as optical coherence tomography and ultra wide-field 
      retinal imaging, artificial intelligence and new treatments, our current 
      classification systems have significant limitations that need to be addressed. In 
      this paper, we provide a historical review of different classification systems 
      for DR, and discuss the limitations of our current classification systems in the 
      context of new developments. We also review the implications of new developments 
      in the field, to see how they might feature in a future, updated classification.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing field and its applications to 
      diabetes, a global pandemic, can reform the approach to diagnosis and management 
      of this chronic condition. Principles of machine learning have been used to build 
      algorithms to support predictive models for the risk of developing diabetes or 
      its consequent complications. Digital therapeutics have proven to be an 
      established intervention for lifestyle therapy in the management of diabetes. 
      Patients are increasingly being empowered for self-management of diabetes, and 
      both patients and health care professionals are benefitting from clinical 
      decision support. AI allows a continuous and burden-free remote monitoring of the 
      patient's symptoms and biomarkers. Further, social media and online communities 
      enhance patient engagement in diabetes care. Technical advances have helped to 
      optimize resource use in diabetes. Together, these intelligent technical reforms 
      have produced better glycemic control with reductions in fasting and postprandial 
      glucose levels, glucose excursions, and glycosylated hemoglobin. AI will 
      introduce a paradigm shift in diabetes care from conventional management 
      strategies to building targeted data-driven precision care.

AB  - Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into 
      the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing 
      millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a 
      comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine 
      learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize 
      and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. 
      Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for 
      object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, 
      supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, 
      unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ 
      widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different 
      datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been 
      approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of 
      ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with 
      automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of 
      therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic 
      approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential 
      benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as 
      large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high 
      quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st 
      century ophthalmology.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas of 
      our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding 
      the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and the related 
      topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to 
      the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, journals, search engines, 
      print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. 
      Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which were approved by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology, 
      especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that 
      artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, 
      especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and 
      retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval 
      stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this 
      technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is 
      believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in 
      identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to 
      physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained 
      professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the 
      possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates 
      for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions about 
      moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it 
      is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status, 
      it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer 
      moral/ethical status are or will be.

AB  - Deep learning evolves into a new form of machine learning technology that is 
      classified under artificial intelligence (AI), which has substantial potential 
      for large-scale healthcare screening and may allow the determination of the most 
      appropriate specific treatment for individual patients. Recent developments in 
      diagnostic technologies facilitated studies on retinal conditions and ocular 
      disease in metabolism and endocrinology. Globally, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is 
      regarded as a major cause of vision loss. Deep learning systems are effective and 
      accurate in the detection of DR from digital fundus photographs or optical 
      coherence tomography. Thus, using AI techniques, systems with high accuracy and 
      efficiency can be developed for diagnosing and screening DR at an early stage and 
      without the resources that are only accessible in special clinics. Deep learning 
      enables early diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity, which makes 
      decisions based on minimally handcrafted features paving the way for personalized 
      DR progression real-time monitoring and in-time ophthalmic or endocrine 
      therapies. This review will discuss cutting-edge AI algorithms, the automated 
      detecting systems of DR stage grading and feature segmentation, the prediction of 
      DR outcomes and therapeutics, and the ophthalmic indications of other systemic 
      diseases revealed by AI.

AB  - With the advancement of computational power, refinement of learning algorithms 
      and architectures, and availability of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) 
      technology, particularly with machine learning and deep learning, is paving the 
      way for 'intelligent' healthcare systems. AI-related research in ophthalmology 
      previously focused on the screening and diagnosis of posterior segment diseases, 
      particularly diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. 
      There is now emerging evidence demonstrating the application of AI to the 
      diagnosis and management of a variety of anterior segment conditions. In this 
      review, we provide an overview of AI applications to the anterior segment 
      addressing keratoconus, infectious keratitis, refractive surgery, corneal 
      transplant, adult and paediatric cataracts, angle-closure glaucoma and iris 
      tumour, and highlight important clinical considerations for adoption of AI 
      technologies, potential integration with telemedicine and future directions.

LID - 10.1038/s41433-019-0566-0 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a global eye health issue. Given the rising in diabetes prevalence 
      and ageing population, this poses significant challenge to perform diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) screening for these patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) using 
      machine learning and deep learning have been adopted by various groups to develop 
      automated DR detection algorithms. This article aims to describe the state-of-art 
      AI DR screening technologies that have been described in the literature, some of 
      which are already commercially available. All these technologies were designed 
      using different training datasets and technical methodologies. Although many 
      groups have published robust diagnostic performance of the AI algorithms for DR 
      screening, future research is required to address several challenges, for 
      examples medicolegal implications, ethics, and clinical deployment model in order 
      to expedite the translation of these novel technologies into the healthcare 
      setting.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to transform healthcare by 
      enhancing the workflow and productivity of clinicians, enabling existing staff to 
      serve more patients, improving patient outcomes, and reducing health disparities. 
      In the field of ophthalmology, AI systems have shown performance comparable with 
      or even better than experienced ophthalmologists in tasks such as diabetic 
      retinopathy detection and grading. However, despite these quite good results, 
      very few AI systems have been deployed in real-world clinical settings, 
      challenging the true value of these systems. This review provides an overview of 
      the current main AI applications in ophthalmology, describes the challenges that 
      need to be overcome prior to clinical implementation of the AI systems, and 
      discusses the strategies that may pave the way to the clinical translation of 
      these systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) can sometimes be treated and prevented from 
      causing irreversible vision loss if caught and treated properly. In this work, a 
      deep learning (DL) model is employed to accurately identify all five stages of 
      DR. METHODS: The suggested methodology presents two examples, one with and one 
      without picture augmentation. A balanced dataset meeting the same criteria in 
      both cases is then generated using augmentative methods. The 
      DenseNet-121-rendered model on the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society 
      (APTOS) and dataset for diabetic retinopathy (DDR) datasets performed 
      exceptionally well when compared to other methods for identifying the five stages 
      of DR. RESULTS: Our propose model achieved the highest test accuracy of 98.36%, 
      top-2 accuracy of 100%, and top-3 accuracy of 100% for the APTOS dataset, and the 
      highest test accuracy of 79.67%, top-2 accuracy of 92.%76, and top-3 accuracy of 
      98.94% for the DDR dataset. Additional criteria (precision, recall, and F1-score) 
      for gauging the efficacy of the proposed model were established with the help of 
      APTOS and DDR. CONCLUSIONS: It was discovered that feeding a model with 
      higher-quality photographs increased its efficiency and ability for learning, as 
      opposed to both state-of-the-art technology and the other, non-enhanced model.

AB  - Retinal screening contributes to early detection of diabetic retinopathy and 
      timely treatment. To facilitate the screening process, we develop a deep learning 
      system, named DeepDR, that can detect early-to-late stages of diabetic 
      retinopathy. DeepDR is trained for real-time image quality assessment, lesion 
      detection and grading using 466,247 fundus images from 121,342 patients with 
      diabetes. Evaluation is performed on a local dataset with 200,136 fundus images 
      from 52,004 patients and three external datasets with a total of 209,322 images. 
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for detecting 
      microaneurysms, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates and hemorrhages are 0.901, 
      0.941, 0.954 and 0.967, respectively. The grading of diabetic retinopathy as 
      mild, moderate, severe and proliferative achieves area under the curves of 0.943, 
      0.955, 0.960 and 0.972, respectively. In external validations, the area under the 
      curves for grading range from 0.916 to 0.970, which further supports the system 
      is efficient for diabetic retinopathy grading.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an 
      unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or 
      screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal 
      of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few 
      applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical 
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically review AI 
      applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. METHODS: 
      We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL 
      to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We 
      also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as 
      registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI 
      applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. RESULTS: 
      We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation 
      of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized 
      controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI 
      applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), 
      disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most 
      commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer 
      (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the 
      evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI 
      applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI 
      applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient 
      outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI 
      implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that research on the clinical 
      implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great 
      potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated 
      with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) enables the creation of computational models comprising 
      multiple processing layers that learn data representations at multiple levels of 
      abstraction. In the recent past, the use of deep learning has been proliferating, 
      yielding promising results in applications across a growing number of fields, 
      most notably in image processing, medical image analysis, data analysis, and 
      bioinformatics. DL algorithms have also had a significant positive impact through 
      yielding improvements in screening, recognition, segmentation, prediction, and 
      classification applications across different domains of healthcare, such as those 
      concerning the abdomen, cardiac, pathology, and retina. Given the extensive body 
      of recent scientific contributions in this discipline, a comprehensive review of 
      deep learning developments in the domain of diabetic retinopathy (DR) analysis, 
      viz., screening, segmentation, prediction, classification, and validation, is 
      presented here. A critical analysis of the relevant reported techniques is 
      carried out, and the associated advantages and limitations highlighted, 
      culminating in the identification of research gaps and future challenges that 
      help to inform the research community to develop more efficient, robust, and 
      accurate DL models for the various challenges in the monitoring and diagnosis of 
      DR.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of our review paper is to examine many existing works of 
      literature presenting the different methods utilized for diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) recognition employing deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) 
      techniques, and also to address the difficulties faced in various datasets used 
      by DR. Approach: DR is a progressive illness and may become a reason for vision 
      loss. Early identification of DR lesions is, therefore, helpful and prevents 
      damage to the retina. However, it is a complex job in view of the fact that it is 
      symptomless earlier, and also ophthalmologists have been needed in traditional 
      approaches. Recently, automated identification of DR-based studies has been 
      stated based on image processing, ML, and DL. We analyze the recent literature 
      and provide a comparative study that also includes the limitations of the 
      literature and future work directions. Results: A relative analysis among the 
      databases used, performance metrics employed, and ML and DL techniques adopted 
      recently in DR detection based on various DR features is presented. Conclusion: 
      Our review paper discusses the methods employed in DR detection along with the 
      technical and clinical challenges that are encountered, which is missing in 
      existing reviews, as well as future scopes to assist researchers in the field of 
      retinal imaging.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy is a retina disease caused by diabetes mellitus and it is 
      the leading cause of blindness globally. Early detection and treatment are 
      necessary in order to delay or avoid vision deterioration and vision loss. To 
      that end, many artificial-intelligence-powered methods have been proposed by the 
      research community for the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy 
      on fundus retina images. This review article provides a thorough analysis of the 
      use of deep learning methods at the various steps of the diabetic retinopathy 
      detection pipeline based on fundus images. We discuss several aspects of that 
      pipeline, ranging from the datasets that are widely used by the research 
      community, the preprocessing techniques employed and how these accelerate and 
      improve the models' performance, to the development of such deep learning models 
      for the diagnosis and grading of the disease as well as the localization of the 
      disease's lesions. We also discuss certain models that have been applied in real 
      clinical settings. Finally, we conclude with some important insights and provide 
      future research directions.

AB  - The number of people who suffer from diabetes in the world has been considerably 
      increasing recently. It affects people of all ages. People who have had diabetes 
      for a long time are affected by a condition called Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), 
      which damages the eyes. Automatic detection using new technologies for early 
      detection can help avoid complications such as the loss of vision. Currently, 
      with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially Deep 
      Learning (DL), DL-based methods are widely preferred for developing DR detection 
      systems. For this purpose, this study surveyed the existing literature on 
      diabetic retinopathy diagnoses from fundus images using deep learning and 
      provides a brief description of the current DL techniques that are used by 
      researchers in this field. After that, this study lists some of the commonly used 
      datasets. This is followed by a performance comparison of these reviewed methods 
      with respect to some commonly used metrics in computer vision tasks.

AB  - Screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy disease is a well known problem 
      in the biomedical domain. The use of medical imagery from a patient's eye for 
      detecting the damage caused to blood vessels is a part of the computer-aided 
      diagnosis that has immensely progressed over the past few years due to the advent 
      and success of deep learning. The challenges related to imbalanced datasets, 
      inconsistent annotations, less number of sample images and inappropriate 
      performance evaluation metrics has caused an adverse impact on the performance of 
      the deep learning models. In order to tackle the effect caused by class 
      imbalance, we have done extensive comparative analysis between various 
      state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets of diabetic retinopathy: - 
      Kaggle DR detection, IDRiD and DDR, for classification, object detection and 
      segmentation tasks. This research could serve as a concrete baseline for future 
      research in this field to find appropriate approaches and deep learning 
      architectures for imbalanced datasets.

TI  - Performance and Limitation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Screening: Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), whose standard diagnosis is performed by 
      human experts, has high prevalence and requires a more efficient screening 
      method. Although machine learning (ML)-based automated DR diagnosis has gained 
      attention due to recent approval of IDx-DR, performance of this tool has not been 
      examined systematically, and the best ML technique for use in a real-world 
      setting has not been discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      systematically examine the overall diagnostic accuracy of ML in diagnosing DR of 
      different categories based on color fundus photographs and to determine the 
      state-of-the-art ML approach. METHODS: Published studies in PubMed and EMBASE 
      were searched from inception to June 2020. Studies were screened for relevant 
      outcomes, publication types, and data sufficiency, and a total of 60 out of 2128 
      (2.82%) studies were retrieved after study selection. Extraction of data was 
      performed by 2 authors according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), and the quality assessment was performed 
      according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). 
      Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy was pooled using a bivariate random effects 
      model. The main outcomes included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity of ML in diagnosing DR based on color fundus photographs, as well as 
      the performances of different major types of ML algorithms. RESULTS: The primary 
      meta-analysis included 60 color fundus photograph studies (445,175 
      interpretations). Overall, ML demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing DR of 
      various categories, with a pooled area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic (AUROC) ranging from 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) to 0.99 (95% CI 
      0.98-1.00). The performance of ML in detecting more-than-mild DR was robust 
      (sensitivity 0.95; AUROC 0.97), and by subgroup analyses, we observed that robust 
      performance of ML was not limited to benchmark data sets (sensitivity 0.92; AUROC 
      0.96) but could be generalized to images collected in clinical practice 
      (sensitivity 0.97; AUROC 0.97). Neural network was the most widely used method, 
      and the subgroup analysis revealed a pooled AUROC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) for 
      studies that used neural networks to diagnose more-than-mild DR. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This meta-analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of ML algorithms in 
      detecting DR on color fundus photographs, suggesting that state-of-the-art, 
      ML-based DR screening algorithms are likely ready for clinical applications. 
      However, a significant portion of the earlier published studies had methodology 
      flaws, such as the lack of external validation and presence of spectrum bias. The 
      results of these studies should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is a major 
      contributor to blindness. Numerous incidences of DR may be avoided if it were 
      identified and addressed promptly. Throughout recent years, many deep learning 
      (DL)-based algorithms have been proposed to facilitate psychometric testing. 
      Utilizing DL model that encompassed four scenarios, DR and its stages were 
      identified in this study using retinal scans from the "Asia Pacific 
      Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 Blindness Detection" dataset. Adopting a 
      DL model then led to the use of augmentation strategies that produced a 
      comprehensive dataset with consistent hyper parameters across all test cases. As 
      a further step in the classification process, we used a Convolutional Neural 
      Network model. Different enhancement methods have been used to raise visual 
      quality. The proposed approach detected the DR with a highest experimental result 
      of 97.83%, a top-2 accuracy of 99.31%, and a top-3 accuracy of 99.88% across all 
      the 5 severity stages of the APTOS 2019 evaluation employing CLAHE and ESRGAN 
      techniques for image enhancement. In addition, we employed APTOS 2019 to develop 
      a set of evaluation metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) to use in analyzing 
      the efficacy of the suggested model. The proposed approach was also proven to be 
      more efficient at DR location than both state-of-the-art technology and 
      conventional DL.

AB  - Diabetes occurs due to the excess of glucose in the blood that may affect many 
      organs of the body. Elevated blood sugar in the body causes many problems 
      including Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). DR occurs due to the mutilation of the blood 
      vessels in the retina. The manual detection of DR by ophthalmologists is 
      complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic detection is required, and 
      recently different machine and deep learning techniques have been applied to 
      detect and classify DR. In this paper, we conducted a study of the various 
      techniques available in the literature for the identification/classification of 
      DR, the strengths and weaknesses of available datasets for each method, and 
      provides the future directions. Moreover, we also discussed the different steps 
      of detection, that are: segmentation of blood vessels in a retina, detection of 
      lesions, and other abnormalities of DR.

TI  - Retinopathy grading with deep learning and wavelet hyper-analytic activations.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1007/s00371-022-02489-z [doi]
AB  - Recent developments reveal the prominence of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading. 
      In the past few decades, Wavelet-based DR classification has shown successful 
      impacts and the Deep Learning models, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's), 
      have evolved in offering the highest prediction accuracy. In this work, the 
      features of the input image are enhanced with the integration of Multi-Resolution 
      Analysis (MRA) and a CNN framework without costing more convolution filters. The 
      bottleneck with conventional activation functions, used in CNN's, is the 
      nullification of the feature maps that are negative in value. In this work, a 
      novel Hyper-analytic Wavelet (HW) phase activation function is formulated with 
      unique characteristics for the wavelet sub-bands. Instead of dismissal, the 
      function transforms these negative coefficients that correspond to significant 
      edge feature maps. The hyper-analytic wavelet phase forms the imaginary part of 
      the complex activation. And the hyper-parameter of the activation function is 
      selected such that the corresponding magnitude spectrum produces monotonic and 
      effective activations. The performance of 3 CNN models (1 custom, shallow CNN, 
      ResNet with Soft attention, Alex Net for DR) with spatial-Wavelet quilts is 
      better. With the spatial-Wavelet quilts, the Alex Net for DR has an improvement 
      with an 11% of accuracy level (from 87 to 98%). The highest accuracy level of 98% 
      and the highest Sensitivity of 99% are attained through Modified Alex Net for DR. 
      The proposal also illustrates the visualization of the negative edge preservation 
      with assumed image patches. From this study, the researcher infers that models 
      with spatial-Wavelet quilts, with the hyper-analytic activations, have better 
      generalization ability. And the visualization of heat maps provides evidence of 
      better learning of the feature maps from the wavelet sub-bands.

LID - 863
AB  - Vision loss can be avoided if diabetic retinopathy (DR) is diagnosed and treated 
      promptly. The main five DR stages are none, moderate, mild, proliferate, and 
      severe. In this study, a deep learning (DL) model is presented that diagnoses all 
      five stages of DR with more accuracy than previous methods. The suggested method 
      presents two scenarios: case 1 with image enhancement using a contrast limited 
      adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) filtering algorithm in conjunction with 
      an enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN), and case 2 
      without image enhancement. Augmentation techniques were then performed to 
      generate a balanced dataset utilizing the same parameters for both cases. Using 
      Inception-V3 applied to the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 
      datasets, the developed model achieved an accuracy of 98.7% for case 1 and 80.87% 
      for case 2, which is greater than existing methods for detecting the five stages 
      of DR. It was demonstrated that using CLAHE and ESRGAN improves a model's 
      performance and learning ability.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An update and overview of the literature on current 
      telemedicine applications in retina. RECENT FINDINGS: The application of 
      telemedicine to the field of Ophthalmology and Retina has been growing with 
      advancing technologies in ophthalmic imaging. Retinal telemedicine has been most 
      commonly applied to diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity in adult 
      and pediatric patients respectively. Telemedicine has the potential to alleviate 
      the growing demand for clinical evaluation of retinal diseases. Subsequently, 
      automated image analysis and deep learning systems may facilitate efficient 
      processing of large, increasing numbers of images generated in telemedicine 
      systems. Telemedicine may additionally improve access to education and 
      standardized training through tele-education systems. SUMMARY: Telemedicine has 
      the potential to be utilized as a useful adjunct but not a complete replacement 
      for physical clinical examinations. Retinal telemedicine programs should be 
      carefully and appropriately integrated into current clinical systems.

TI  - Automatic Screening of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Fundus Images and Machine 
      Learning Algorithms.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12092262 [doi]
LID - 2262
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy is a vision impairment caused by blood vessel degeneration 
      in the retina. It is becoming more widespread as it is linked to diabetes. 
      Diabetic retinopathy can lead to blindness. Early detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy by an ophthalmologist can help avoid vision loss and other 
      complications. Diabetic retinopathy is currently diagnosed by visually 
      recognizing irregularities on fundus pictures. This procedure, however, 
      necessitates the use of ophthalmic imaging technologies to acquire fundus images 
      as well as a detailed visual analysis of the stored photos, resulting in a costly 
      and time-consuming diagnosis. The fundamental goal of this project is to create 
      an easy-to-use machine learning model tool that can accurately predict diabetic 
      retinopathy using pre-recorded digital fundus images. To create the suggested 
      classifier model, we gathered annotated fundus images from publicly accessible 
      data repositories and used two machine learning methods, support vector machine 
      (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN). On test data, the proposed SVM model had a 
      mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.11%, 
      whereas the DNN model had a mean AUC of 99.15%.

TI  - Deep learning-based hemorrhage detection for diabetic retinopathy screening.
PG  - 1479
LID - 10.1038/s41598-023-28680-3 [doi]
LID - 1479
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a retinal compilation that causes visual impairment. 
      Hemorrhage is one of the pathological symptoms of diabetic retinopathy that 
      emerges during disease development. Therefore, hemorrhage detection reveals the 
      presence of diabetic retinopathy in the early phase. Diagnosing the disease in 
      its initial stage is crucial to adopt proper treatment so the repercussions can 
      be prevented. The automatic deep learning-based hemorrhage detection method is 
      proposed that can be used as the second interpreter for ophthalmologists to 
      reduce the time and complexity of conventional screening methods. The quality of 
      the images was enhanced, and the prospective hemorrhage locations were estimated 
      in the preprocessing stage. Modified gamma correction adaptively illuminates 
      fundus images by using gradient information to address the nonuniform brightness 
      levels of images. The algorithm estimated the locations of potential candidates 
      by using a Gaussian match filter, entropy thresholding, and mathematical 
      morphology. The required objects were segmented using the regional diversity at 
      estimated locations. The novel hemorrhage network is propounded for hemorrhage 
      classification and compared with the renowned deep models. Two datasets 
      benchmarked the model's performance using sensitivity, specificity, precision, 
      and accuracy metrics. Despite being the shallowest network, the proposed network 
      marked competitive results than LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG-16. The 
      hemorrhage network was assessed using training time and classification accuracy 
      through synthetic experimentation. Results showed promising accuracy in the 
      classification stage while significantly reducing training time. The research 
      concluded that increasing deep network layers does not guarantee good results but 
      rather increases training time. The suitable architecture of a deep model and its 
      appropriate parameters are critical for obtaining excellent outcomes.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a health condition caused due to Diabetes Mellitus 
      (DM). It causes vision problems and blindness due to disfigurement of human 
      retina. According to statistics, 80% of diabetes patients battling from long 
      diabetic period of 15 to 20 years, suffer from DR. Hence, it has become a 
      dangerous threat to the health and life of people. To overcome DR, manual 
      diagnosis of the disease is feasible but overwhelming and cumbersome at the same 
      time and hence requires a revolutionary method. Thus, such a health condition 
      necessitates primary recognition and diagnosis to prevent DR from developing into 
      severe stages and prevent blindness. Innumerable Machine Learning (ML) models are 
      proposed by researchers across the globe, to achieve this purpose. Various 
      feature extraction techniques are proposed for extraction of DR features for 
      early detection. However, traditional ML models have shown either meagre 
      generalization throughout feature extraction and classification for deploying 
      smaller datasets or consumes more of training time causing inefficiency in 
      prediction while using larger datasets. Hence Deep Learning (DL), a new domain of 
      ML, is introduced. DL models can handle a smaller dataset with help of efficient 
      data processing techniques. However, they generally incorporate larger datasets 
      for their deep architectures to enhance performance in feature extraction and 
      image classification. This paper gives a detailed review on DR, its features, 
      causes, ML models, state-of-the-art DL models, challenges, comparisons and future 
      directions, for early detection of DR.

LID - 84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Doctors can detect symptoms of diabetic retinopathy (DR) early by 
      using retinal ophthalmoscopy, and they can improve diagnostic efficiency with the 
      assistance of deep learning to select treatments and support personnel workflow. 
      Conventionally, most deep learning methods for DR diagnosis categorize retinal 
      ophthalmoscopy images into training and validation data sets according to the 
      80/20 rule, and they use the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) in 
      data processing (e.g., rotating, scaling, and translating training images) to 
      increase the number of training samples. Oversampling training may lead to 
      overfitting of the training model. Therefore, untrained or unverified images can 
      yield erroneous predictions. Although the accuracy of prediction results is 
      90%-99%, this overfitting of training data may distort training module variables. 
      RESULTS: This study uses a 2-stage training method to solve the overfitting 
      problem. In the training phase, to build the model, the Learning module 1 used to 
      identify the DR and no-DR. The Learning module 2 on SMOTE synthetic datasets to 
      identify the mild-NPDR, moderate NPDR, severe NPDR and proliferative DR 
      classification. These two modules also used early stopping and data dividing 
      methods to reduce overfitting by oversampling. In the test phase, we use the 
      DIARETDB0, DIARETDB1, eOphtha, MESSIDOR, and DRIVE datasets to evaluate the 
      performance of the training network. The prediction accuracy achieved to 85.38%, 
      84.27%, 85.75%, 86.73%, and 92.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experiment, a 
      general deep learning model for detecting DR was developed, and it could be used 
      with all DR databases. We provided a simple method of addressing the imbalance of 
      DR databases, and this method can be used with other medical images.

AB  - AIMS: To establish an automated method for identifying referable diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR), defined as moderate nonproliferative DR and above, using deep 
      learning-based lesion detection and stage grading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set 
      of 12,252 eligible fundus images of diabetic patients were manually annotated by 
      45 licenced ophthalmologists and were randomly split into training, validation, 
      and internal test sets (ratio of 7:1:2). Another set of 565 eligible consecutive 
      clinical fundus images was established as an external test set. For automated 
      referable DR identification, four deep learning models were programmed based on 
      whether two factors were included: DR-related lesions and DR stages. Sensitivity, 
      specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
      were reported for referable DR identification, while precision and recall were 
      reported for lesion detection. RESULTS: Adding lesion information to the 
      five-stage grading model improved the AUC (0.943 vs. 0.938), sensitivity (90.6% 
      vs. 90.5%) and specificity (80.7% vs. 78.5%) of the model for identifying 
      referable DR in the internal test set. Adding stage information to the 
      lesion-based model increased the AUC (0.943 vs. 0.936) and sensitivity (90.6% vs. 
      76.7%) of the model for identifying referable DR in the internal test set. 
      Similar trends were also seen in the external test set. DR lesion types with high 
      precision results were preretinal haemorrhage, hard exudate, vitreous 
      haemorrhage, neovascularisation, cotton wool spots and fibrous proliferation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The herein described automated model employed DR lesions and stage 
      information to identify referable DR and displayed better diagnostic value than 
      models built without this information.

TI  - Using Deep Learning Architectures for Detection and Classification of Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/s23125726 [doi]
LID - 5726
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of long-term diabetes, 
      affecting the human eye and potentially leading to permanent blindness. The early 
      detection of DR is crucial for effective treatment, as symptoms often manifest in 
      later stages. The manual grading of retinal images is time-consuming, prone to 
      errors, and lacks patient-friendliness. In this study, we propose two deep 
      learning (DL) architectures, a hybrid network combining VGG16 and XGBoost 
      Classifier, and the DenseNet 121 network, for DR detection and classification. To 
      evaluate the two DL models, we preprocessed a collection of retinal images 
      obtained from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Kaggle Dataset. This dataset 
      exhibits an imbalanced image class distribution, which we addressed through 
      appropriate balancing techniques. The performance of the considered models was 
      assessed in terms of accuracy. The results showed that the hybrid network 
      achieved an accuracy of 79.50%, while the DenseNet 121 model achieved an accuracy 
      of 97.30%. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing methods utilizing 
      the same dataset revealed the superior performance of the DenseNet 121 network. 
      The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of DL architectures for the 
      early detection and classification of DR. The superior performance of the 
      DenseNet 121 model highlights its effectiveness in this domain. The 
      implementation of such automated methods can significantly improve the efficiency 
      and accuracy of DR diagnosis, benefiting both healthcare providers and patients.

AB  - One of the primary causes of blindness in the diabetic population is diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). Many people could have their sight saved if only DR were 
      detected and treated in time. Numerous Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have been 
      presented to improve human analysis. Using a DL model with three scenarios, this 
      research classified DR and its severity stages from fundus images using the 
      "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection" dataset. Following the adoption of the DL model, 
      augmentation methods were implemented to generate a balanced dataset with 
      consistent input parameters across all test scenarios. As a last step in the 
      categorization process, the DenseNet-121 model was employed. Several methods, 
      including Enhanced Super-resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), 
      Histogram Equalization (HIST), and Contrast Limited Adaptive HIST (CLAHE), have 
      been used to enhance image quality in a variety of contexts. The suggested model 
      detected the DR across all five APTOS 2019 grading process phases with the 
      highest test accuracy of 98.36%, top-2 accuracy of 100%, and top-3 accuracy of 
      100%. Further evaluation criteria (precision, recall, and F1-score) for gauging 
      the efficacy of the proposed model were established with the help of APTOS 2019. 
      Furthermore, comparing CLAHE + ESRGAN against both state-of-the-art technology 
      and other recommended methods, it was found that its use was more effective in DR 
      classification.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) results in vision loss if not treated early. A 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on retinal fundus images is an 
      efficient and effective method for early DR diagnosis and assisting experts. A 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system involves various stages like detection, 
      segmentation and classification of lesions in fundus images. Many traditional 
      machine-learning (ML) techniques based on hand-engineered features have been 
      introduced. The recent emergence of deep learning (DL) and its decisive victory 
      over traditional ML methods for various applications motivated the researchers to 
      employ it for DR diagnosis, and many deep-learning-based methods have been 
      introduced. In this paper, we review these methods, highlighting their pros and 
      cons. In addition, we point out the challenges to be addressed in designing and 
      learning about efficient, effective and robust deep-learning algorithms for 
      various problems in DR diagnosis and draw attention to directions for future 
      research.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening images are heterogeneous and contain 
      undesirable non-retinal, incorrect field and ungradable samples which require 
      curation, a laborious task to perform manually. We developed and validated single 
      and multi-output laterality, retinal presence, retinal field and gradability 
      classification deep learning (DL) models for automated curation. The internal 
      dataset comprised of 7743 images from DR screening (UK) with 1479 external test 
      images (Portugal and Paraguay). Internal vs external multi-output laterality 
      AUROC were right (0.994 vs 0.905), left (0.994 vs 0.911) and unidentifiable 
      (0.996 vs 0.680). Retinal presence AUROC were (1.000 vs 1.000). Retinal field 
      AUROC were macula (0.994 vs 0.955), nasal (0.995 vs 0.962) and other retinal 
      field (0.997 vs 0.944). Gradability AUROC were (0.985 vs 0.918). DL effectively 
      detects laterality, retinal presence, retinal field and gradability of DR 
      screening images with generalisation between centres and populations. DL models 
      could be used for automated image curation within DR screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes and a 
      common cause of visual loss in adults. We aimed to assess the correlation between 
      IL gene-related SNPs and the incidence of DR and attempted to predict DR with 
      combined mutation site detection. METHODS: A systematic search of databases was 
      performed up to August 2019. Five genetic models were used to analyze 
      associations. Machine learning methods were implemented to improve SNP-related 
      disease prediction. RESULTS: Sixteen trials assessing a total of 7221 patients 
      were included in our meta-analysis. IL6/rs1800795, rs1800796, and IL10/rs1800896 
      were analyzed. For the IL-6 gene, there was no significant association between 
      rs1800795 and the incidence of DR (allelic model: OR, 1.091; 95% CI, 0.892-1.334; 
      p = .396). There was no significant correlation between rs1800796 (allelic model: 
      OR, 1.135; 95% CI, 0.678-1.901; p = .63), rs1800896 (allelic model: OR, 1.047; 
      95% CI, 0.788-1.392; p = .752) and the incidence of DR. Unfortunately, the 
      machine learning results also showed that the combined detection of two SNPs 
      could not accurately predict DR occurrence. CONCLUSION: rs1800795 and rs1800796 
      in the IL-6 gene and rs1800896 in IL-10 gene are not related to the incidence of 
      DR. Mutations in multiple SNPs for each DR patient still need to be specifically 
      assessed to increase prediction accuracy.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease resulting from diabetes complications, 
      causing non-reversible damage to retina blood vessels. DR is a leading cause of 
      blindness if not detected early. The currently available DR treatments are 
      limited to stopping or delaying the deterioration of sight, highlighting the 
      importance of regular scanning using high-efficiency computer-based systems to 
      diagnose cases early. The current work presented fully automatic diagnosis 
      systems that exceed manual techniques to avoid misdiagnosis, reducing time, 
      effort and cost. The proposed system classifies DR images into five stages-no-DR, 
      mild, moderate, severe and proliferative DR-as well as localizing the affected 
      lesions on retain surface. The system comprises two deep learning-based models. 
      The first model (CNN512) used the whole image as an input to the CNN model to 
      classify it into one of the five DR stages. It achieved an accuracy of 88.6% and 
      84.1% on the DDR and the APTOS Kaggle 2019 public datasets, respectively, 
      compared to the state-of-the-art results. Simultaneously, the second model used 
      an adopted YOLOv3 model to detect and localize the DR lesions, achieving a 0.216 
      mAP in lesion localization on the DDR dataset, which improves the current 
      state-of-the-art results. Finally, both of the proposed structures, CNN512 and 
      YOLOv3, were fused to classify DR images and localize DR lesions, obtaining an 
      accuracy of 89% with 89% sensitivity, 97.3 specificity and that exceeds the 
      current state-of-the-art results.

LID - 10.1007/s10278-021-00418-5 [doi]
AB  - The diabetic retinopathy accounts in the deterioration of retinal blood vessels 
      leading to a serious compilation affecting the eyes. The automated DR diagnosis 
      frameworks are critically important for the early identification and detection of 
      these eye-related problems, helping the ophthalmic experts in providing the 
      second opinion for effectual treatment. The deep learning techniques have evolved 
      as an improvement over the conventional approaches, which are dependent on the 
      handcrafted feature extraction. To address the issue of proficient DR 
      discrimination, the authors have proposed a quadrant ensemble automated DR 
      grading approach by implementing InceptionResnet-V2 deep neural network 
      framework. The presented model incorporates histogram equalization, optical disc 
      localization, and quadrant cropping along with the data augmentation step for 
      improving the network performance. A superior accuracy performance of 93.33% is 
      observed for the proposed framework, and a significant reduction of 0.325 is 
      noticed in the cross-entropy loss function for MESSIDOR benchmark dataset; 
      however, its validation utilizing the latest IDRiD dataset establishes its 
      generalization ability. The accuracy improvement of 13.58% is observed when the 
      proposed QEIRV-2 model is compared with the classical Inception-V3 CNN model. To 
      justify the viability of the proposed framework, its performance is compared with 
      the existing state-of-the-art approaches and 25.23% of accuracy improvement is 
      observed.

AB  - As per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, 35-60% of people 
      suffering from diabetic retinopathy (DR) have a history of diabetes. DR is one of 
      the primary reasons for blindness and visual impairment worldwide among adults 
      aged 24-74 years. Therefore, this research aims to develop an automated technique 
      for the detection of retinal abnormalities associated with DR, such as 
      microaneurysm. Unsupervised learning has a high potential for data 
      classification. The proposed work accomplishes the following objectives. (a) 
      k-means and fuzzy clustering method is discussed, and the objective function is 
      revised to offer the modified version named modified fuzzy clustering method 
      (MdFCM). (b) A modified convolutional neural network is proposed to consolidate 
      the MdFCM and features for better outcomes. (c) The results are compared on three 
      diverse datasets, DIARETDB1, APTOS, and Liverpool, with the fuzzy clustering 
      method, deep embedded clustering, and k-means for generalizability. To the best 
      of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first to detect DR using a hybrid 
      approach of unsupervised and deep learning methodology. The proposed system 
      achieved an improved accuracy rate of 98.6%. The results show that our proposed 
      method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm. We intend to design a tool 
      using the proposed system for diabetic retinopathy detection at an early stage.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the intelligent 
      diagnosis of severe DR with lesion recognition based on color fundus photography. 
      METHODS: The Kaggle public dataset for DR grading is used in the project, 
      including 53,576 fundus photos in the test set, 28,101 in the training set, and 
      7,025 in the validation set. We randomly select 4,192 images for lesion 
      annotation. Inception V3 structure is adopted as the classification algorithm. 
      Both 299 × 299 pixel images and 896 × 896 pixel images are used as the input 
      size. ROC curve, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and their harmonic mean are used 
      to evaluate the performance of the models. RESULTS: The harmonic mean and AUC of 
      the model of 896 × 896 input are higher than those of the 299 × 299 input model. 
      The sensitivity, specificity, harmonic mean, and AUC of the method with 896 × 896 
      resolution images as input for severe DR are 0.925, 0.907, 0.916, and 0.968, 
      respectively. The prediction error mainly occurs in moderate NPDR, and cases with 
      more hard exudates and cotton wool spots are easily predicted as severe cases. 
      Cases with preretinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage are easily identified as 
      severe cases, and IRMA is the most difficult lesion to recognize. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have studied the intelligent diagnosis of severe DR based on color fundus 
      photography. This artificial intelligence-based technology offers a possibility 
      to increase the accessibility and efficiency of severe DR screening.

TI  - A Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Framework Based on Deep-Learning Analysis 
      of OCT Angiography.

AB  - PURPOSE: Reliable classification of referable and vision threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) is essential for patients with diabetes to prevent blindness. 
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its angiography (OCTA) have several 
      advantages over fundus photographs. We evaluated a deep-learning-aided DR 
      classification framework using volumetric OCT and OCTA. METHODS: Four hundred 
      fifty-six OCT and OCTA volumes were scanned from eyes of 50 healthy participants 
      and 305 patients with diabetes. Retina specialists labeled the eyes as 
      non-referable (nrDR), referable (rDR), or vision threatening DR (vtDR). Each eye 
      underwent a 3 × 3-mm scan using a commercial 70 kHz spectral-domain OCT system. 
      We developed a DR classification framework and trained it using volumetric OCT 
      and OCTA to classify eyes into rDR and vtDR. For the scans identified as rDR or 
      vtDR, 3D class activation maps were generated to highlight the subregions which 
      were considered important by the framework for DR classification. RESULTS: For 
      rDR classification, the framework achieved a 0.96 ± 0.01 area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 0.83 ± 0.04 quadratic-weighted kappa. 
      For vtDR classification, the framework achieved a 0.92 ± 0.02 AUC and 0.73 ± 0.04 
      quadratic-weighted kappa. In addition, the multiple DR classification (non-rDR, 
      rDR but non-vtDR, or vtDR) achieved a 0.83 ± 0.03 quadratic-weighted kappa. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning framework only based on OCT and OCTA can provide 
      specialist-level DR classification using only a single imaging modality. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The proposed framework can be used to develop clinically 
      valuable automated DR diagnosis system because of the specialist-level 
      performance showed in this study.

TI  - A Robust Machine Learning Model for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification.
LID - 10.3390/jimaging10010008 [doi]
LID - 8
AB  - Ensemble learning is a process that belongs to the artificial intelligence (AI) 
      field. It helps to choose a robust machine learning (ML) model, usually used for 
      data classification. AI has a large connection with image processing and feature 
      classification, and it can also be successfully applied to analyzing fundus eye 
      images. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease that can cause vision loss and 
      blindness, which, from an imaging point of view, can be shown when screening the 
      eyes. Image processing tools can analyze and extract the features from fundus eye 
      images, and these corroborate with ML classifiers that can perform their 
      classification among different disease classes. The outcomes integrated into 
      automated diagnostic systems can be a real success for physicians and patients. 
      In this study, in the form image processing area, the manipulation of the 
      contrast with the gamma correction parameter was applied because DR affects the 
      blood vessels, and the structure of the eyes becomes disorderly. Therefore, the 
      analysis of the texture with two types of entropies was necessary. Shannon and 
      fuzzy entropies and contrast manipulation led to ten original features used in 
      the classification process. The machine learning library PyCaret performs complex 
      tasks, and the empirical process shows that of the fifteen classifiers, the 
      gradient boosting classifier (GBC) provides the best results. Indeed, the 
      proposed model can classify the DR degrees as normal or severe, achieving an 
      accuracy of 0.929, an F1 score of 0.902, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 
      0.941. The validation of the selected model with a bootstrap statistical 
      technique was performed. The novelty of the study consists of the extraction of 
      features from preprocessed fundus eye images, their classification, and the 
      manipulation of the contrast in a controlled way.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common chronic diseases around the 
      world. Early screening and diagnosis of DR patients through retinal fundus is 
      always preferred. However, image screening and diagnosis is a highly 
      time-consuming task for clinicians. So, there is a high need for automatic 
      diagnosis. The objective of our study is to develop and validate a new automated 
      deep learning-based approach for diabetic retinopathy multi-class detection and 
      classification. In this study we evaluate the contribution of the DR features in 
      each color channel then we pick the most significant channels and calculate their 
      principal components (PCA) which are then fed to the deep learning model, and the 
      grading decision is decided based on a majority voting scheme applied to the out 
      of the deep learning model. The developed models were trained on a publicly 
      available dataset with around 80K color fundus images and were tested on our 
      local dataset with around 100 images. Our results show a significant improvement 
      in DR multi-class classification with 85% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, and 96% 
      specificity.

AB  - Visually impaired and blind people due to diabetic retinopathy were 2.6 million 
      in 2015 and estimated to be 3.2 million in 2020 globally. Though the incidence of 
      diabetic retinopathy is expected to decrease for high-income countries, detection 
      and treatment of it in the early stages are crucial for low-income and 
      middle-income countries. Due to the recent advancement of deep learning 
      technologies, researchers showed that automated screening and grading of diabetic 
      retinopathy are efficient in saving time and workforce. However, most automatic 
      systems utilize conventional fundus photography, despite ultra-wide-field fundus 
      photography provides up to 82% of the retinal surface. In this study, we present 
      a diabetic retinopathy detection system based on ultra-wide-field fundus 
      photography and deep learning. In experiments, we show that the use of early 
      treatment diabetic retinopathy study 7-standard field image extracted from 
      ultra-wide-field fundus photography outperforms that of the optic disc and macula 
      centered image in a statistical sense.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop an automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) staging system using 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with a convolutional 
      neural network (CNN) and to verify the feasibility of the system. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective cross-sectional study, a total of 918 data sets of 3 × 3 mm2 
      OCTA images and 917 data sets of 6 × 6 mm2 OCTA images were obtained from 1118 
      eyes. A deep CNN and four traditional machine learning models were trained with 
      annotations made by a retinal specialist based on ultra-widefield fluorescein 
      angiography. Separately, the same images of the test data sets were independently 
      graded by two human experts. The results of the CNN algorithm were compared with 
      those of traditional machine learning-based classifiers and human experts. 
      RESULTS: The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.728, a sensitivity of 0.675, 
      a specificity of 0.944, an F1 score of 0.683, and a quadratic weighted κ of 0.908 
      for a six-level staging task, which were far superior to the results of 
      traditional machine learning methods or human experts. The CNN algorithm showed a 
      better performance using 6 × 6 mm2 rather than 3 × 3 mm2 sized OCTA images and 
      using combined data rather than a separate OCTA layer alone. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CNN-based classification using OCTA images can provide reliable assistance to 
      clinicians for DR classification. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This CNN algorithm can 
      guide the clinical decision for invasive angiography or referrals to 
      ophthalmology specialists, helping to create more efficient diagnostic workflow 
      in primary care settings.

AB  - Retinopathy is one of the most common micro vascular impairments in diabetic 
      subjects. Elevated blood glucose leads to capillary occlusion, provoking the 
      uncontrolled increase in local growth of new vessels in the retina. When left 
      untreated, it can lead to blindness. Traditional approaches for retinopathy 
      detection require expensive devices and high specialized personnel. Being a 
      microvascular complication, the retinopathy could be detected using the 
      photoplethysmography (PPG) technology. In this paper we investigate the 
      predictive value of the pulse wave velocity and PPG signal analysis with machine 
      and deep learning approaches to detect retinopathy in diabetic subjects. PPG 
      signals and pulse wave velocity (PWV) showed promising results in assessing the 
      diabetic retinopathy. The best performances were scored by a LightGBM based model 
      trained over a subset of the available dataset obtaining 80% of specificity and 
      sensitivity.Clinical relevance- PPG based retinopathy detection could make the 
      retinopathy detection more accessible since it does not need neither expensive 
      devices for signal acquisition nor highly specialized personnel to be 
      interpreted.

AB  - Early diagnosis of retinopathy is essential for preventing retinal complications 
      and visual impairment due to diabetes. For the detection of retinopathy lesions 
      from retinal images, several automatic approaches based on deep neural networks 
      have been developed in the recent years. Most of the proposed methods produce 
      point estimates of pixels belonging to the lesion areas and give no or little 
      information on the uncertainty of method predictions. However, the latter can be 
      essential in the examination of the medical condition of the patient when the 
      goal is early detection of abnormalities. This work extends the recent research 
      with a Bayesian framework by considering the parameters of a convolutional neural 
      network as random variables and utilizing stochastic variational dropout based 
      approximation for uncertainty quantification. The framework includes an extended 
      validation procedure and it allows analyzing lesion segmentation distributions, 
      model calibration and prediction uncertainties. Also the challenges related to 
      the deep probabilistic model and uncertainty quantification are presented. The 
      proposed method achieves area under precision-recall curve of 0.84 for hard 
      exudates, 0.641 for soft exudates, 0.593 for haemorrhages, and 0.484 for 
      microaneurysms on IDRiD dataset.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an emerging research area for detection 
      of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) development in fundus images with highly reliable 
      results. However, its accuracy depends on the availability of big datasets to 
      train such a deep network. Due to the privacy concerns, the strict rules on 
      medical data limit accessibility of images in publicly available datasets. In 
      this paper, we propose a collaborative learning approach to train CNN models with 
      multiple datasets while preserving the privacy of datasets in a distributed 
      learning environment without sharing them. First, CNN networks are trained with 
      private datasets, and tested with the same publicly available images. Based on 
      their initial accuracies, the CNN model with the lowest performance among 
      datasets is forwarded to second lowest performed dataset to retrain it using the 
      transfer learning approach. Then, the retrained network is forwarded to next 
      dataset. This procedure is repeated for each dataset from the lowest performed 
      dataset to the highest. With this ascending chain order fashion, the network is 
      retrained again and again using different datasets and its performance is 
      improved over the time. Based on our experimental results on five different 
      retina image datasets, DR detection accuracy is increased to 93.5% compared with 
      the accuracies of merged datasets (84%) and individual datasets (73%, 78%, 83%, 
      85%).

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is defined as the Diabetes Mellitus difficulty that 
      harms the blood vessels in the retina. It is also known as a silent disease and 
      cause mild vision issues or no symptoms. In order to enhance the chances of 
      effective treatment, yearly eye tests are vital for premature discovery. Hence, 
      it uses fundus cameras for capturing retinal images, but due to its size and 
      cost, it is a troublesome for extensive screening. Therefore, the smartphones are 
      utilized for scheming low-power, small-sized, and reasonable retinal imaging 
      schemes to activate automated DR detection and DR screening. In this article, the 
      new DIY (do it yourself) smartphone enabled camera is used for smartphone based 
      DR detection. Initially, the preprocessing like green channel transformation and 
      CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) are performed. Further, 
      the segmentation process starts with optic disc segmentation by WT (watershed 
      transform) and abnormality segmentation (Exudates, microaneurysms, haemorrhages, 
      and IRMA) by Triplet half band filter bank (THFB). Then the different features 
      are extracted by Haralick and ADTCWT (Anisotropic Dual Tree Complex Wavelet 
      Transform) methods. Using life choice-based optimizer (LCBO) algorithm, the 
      optimal features are chosen from the mined features. Then the selected features 
      are applied to the optimized hybrid ML (machine learning) classifier with the 
      combination of NN and DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) in which the SSD 
      (Social Ski-Driver) is utilized for the best weight values of hybrid classifier 
      to categorize the severity level as mild DR, severe DR, normal, moderate DR, and 
      Proliferative DR. The proposed work is simulated in python environment and to 
      test the efficiency of the proposed scheme the datasets like 
      APTOS-2019-Blindness-Detection, and EyePacs are used. The model has been 
      evaluated using different performance metrics. The simulation results verified 
      that the suggested scheme is provides well accuracy for each dataset than other 
      current approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Support vector machine-based automated grading (known as 
      iGradingM) has been shown to be safe, cost-effective and robust in the diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) screening (DES) programme in Scotland. It triages screening 
      episodes as gradable with no DR versus manual grading required. The study aim was 
      to develop a deep learning-based autograder using images and gradings from DES 
      and to compare its performance with that of iGradingM. METHODS: Retinal images, 
      quality assurance (QA) data and routine DR grades were obtained from national 
      datasets in 179 944 patients for years 2006-2016. QA grades were available for 
      744 images. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm to detect whether either 
      eye contained ungradable images or any DR. The sensitivity and specificity were 
      evaluated against consensus QA grades and routine grades. RESULTS: Images used in 
      QA which were ungradable or with DR were detected by deep learning with better 
      specificity compared with manual graders (p<0.001) and with iGradingM (p<0.001) 
      at the same sensitivities. Any DR according to the DES final grade was detected 
      with 89.19% (270 392/303 154) sensitivity and 77.41% (500 945/647 158) 
      specificity. Observable disease and referable disease were detected with 
      sensitivities of 96.58% (16 613/17 201) and 98.48% (22 600/22 948), respectively. 
      Overall, 43.84% of screening episodes would require manual grading. CONCLUSION: A 
      deep learning-based system for DR grading was evaluated in QA data and images 
      from 11 years in 50% of people attending a national DR screening programme. The 
      system could reduce the manual grading workload at the same sensitivity compared 
      with the current automated grading system.

AB  - Eye care professionals generally use fundoscopy to confirm the occurrence of 
      Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients. Early DR detection and accurate DR grading 
      are critical for the care and management of this disease. This work proposes an 
      automated DR grading method in which features can be extracted from the fundus 
      images and categorized based on severity using deep learning and Machine Learning 
      (ML) algorithms. A Multipath Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) is used for 
      global and local feature extraction from images. Then, a machine learning 
      classifier is used to categorize the input according to the severity. The 
      proposed model is evaluated across different publicly available databases (IDRiD, 
      Kaggle (for DR detection), and MESSIDOR) and different ML classifiers (Support 
      Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and J48). The metrics selected for model 
      evaluation are the False Positive Rate (FPR), Specificity, Precision, Recall, 
      F1-score, K-score, and Accuracy. The experiments show that the best response is 
      produced by the M-CNN network with the J48 classifier. The classifiers are 
      evaluated across the pre-trained network features and existing DR grading 
      methods. The average accuracy obtained for the proposed work is 99.62% for DR 
      grading. The experiments and evaluation results show that the proposed method 
      works well for accurate DR grading and early disease detection.

TI  - Deep Learning for the Detection and Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy with 
      an Improved Activation Function.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11010097 [doi]
LID - 97
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease triggered due to diabetes, which may 
      lead to blindness. To prevent diabetic patients from becoming blind, early 
      diagnosis and accurate detection of DR are vital. Deep learning models, such as 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are largely used in DR detection through 
      the classification of blood vessel pixels from the remaining pixels. In this 
      paper, an improved activation function was proposed for diagnosing DR from fundus 
      images that automatically reduces loss and processing time. The DIARETDB0, DRIVE, 
      CHASE, and Kaggle datasets were used to train and test the enhanced activation 
      function in the different CNN models. The ResNet-152 model has the highest 
      accuracy of 99.41% with the Kaggle dataset. This enhanced activation function is 
      suitable for DR diagnosis from retinal fundus images.

AB  - Remarkable advances in biomedical research have led to the generation of large 
      amounts of data. Using artificial intelligence, it has become possible to extract 
      meaningful information from large volumes of data, in a shorter frame of time, 
      with very less human interference. In effect, convolutional neural networks (a 
      deep learning method) have been taught to recognize pathological lesions from 
      images. Diabetes has high morbidity, with millions of people who need to be 
      screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Deep neural networks offer a great 
      advantage of screening for DR from retinal images, in improved identification of 
      DR lesions and risk factors for diseases, with high accuracy and reliability. 
      This review aims to compare the current evidences on various deep learning models 
      for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).

TI  - Ocular microvascular complications in diabetic retinopathy: insights from machine 
      learning.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2023-003758 [doi]
LID - e003758
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable 
      blindness among working-age adults, primarily driven by ocular microvascular 
      complications from chronic hyperglycemia. Comprehending the complex relationship 
      between microvascular changes in the eye and disease progression poses 
      challenges, traditional methods assuming linear or logistical relationships may 
      not adequately capture the intricate interactions between these changes and 
      disease advances. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the microvascular 
      involvement of diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-proliferative DR with the 
      implementation of non-parametric machine learning methods. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included optical 
      coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images collected from a healthy group 
      (196 eyes), a DM no DR group (120 eyes), a mild DR group (71 eyes), and a 
      moderate DR group (66 eyes). We implemented a non-parametric machine learning 
      method for four classification tasks that used parameters extracted from the OCTA 
      images as predictors: DM no DR versus healthy, mild DR versus DM no DR, moderate 
      DR versus mild DR, and any DR versus no DR. SHapley Additive exPlanations values 
      were used to determine the importance of these parameters in the classification. 
      RESULTS: We found large choriocapillaris flow deficits were the most important 
      for healthy versus DM no DR, and became less important in eyes with mild or 
      moderate DR. The superficial microvasculature was important for the healthy 
      versus DM no DR and mild DR versus moderate DR tasks, but not for the DM no DR 
      versus mild DR task-the stage when deep microvasculature plays an important role. 
      Foveal avascular zone metric was in general less affected, but its involvement 
      increased with worsening DR. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide 
      valuable insights into the microvascular involvement of DM and DR, facilitating 
      the development of early detection methods and intervention strategies.

TI  - A Lightweight Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Model Using a Deep-Learning 
      Technique.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13193120 [doi]
LID - 3120
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes. It affects a 
      large portion of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Existing systems 
      assist clinicians in treating DR patients. However, these systems entail 
      significantly high computational costs. In addition, dataset imbalances may lead 
      existing DR detection systems to produce false positive outcomes. Therefore, the 
      author intended to develop a lightweight deep-learning (DL)-based DR-severity 
      grading system that could be used with limited computational resources. The 
      proposed model followed an image pre-processing approach to overcome the noise 
      and artifacts found in fundus images. A feature extraction process using the You 
      Only Look Once (Yolo) V7 technique was suggested. It was used to provide feature 
      sets. The author employed a tailored quantum marine predator algorithm (QMPA) for 
      selecting appropriate features. A hyperparameter-optimized MobileNet V3 model was 
      utilized for predicting severity levels using images. The author generalized the 
      proposed model using the APTOS and EyePacs datasets. The APTOS dataset contained 
      5590 fundus images, whereas the EyePacs dataset included 35,100 images. The 
      outcome of the comparative analysis revealed that the proposed model achieved an 
      accuracy of 98.0 and 98.4 and an F1 Score of 93.7 and 93.1 in the APTOS and 
      EyePacs datasets, respectively. In terms of computational complexity, the 
      proposed DR model required fewer parameters, fewer floating-point operations 
      (FLOPs), a lower learning rate, and less training time to learn the key patterns 
      of the fundus images. The lightweight nature of the proposed model can allow 
      healthcare centers to serve patients in remote locations. The proposed model can 
      be implemented as a mobile application to support clinicians in treating DR 
      patients. In the future, the author will focus on improving the proposed model's 
      efficiency to detect DR from low-quality fundus images.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy screening is instrumental to preventing 
      blindness, but scaling up screening is challenging because of the increasing 
      number of patients with all forms of diabetes. We aimed to create a deep-learning 
      system to predict the risk of patients with diabetes developing diabetic 
      retinopathy within 2 years. METHODS: We created and validated two versions of a 
      deep-learning system to predict the development of diabetic retinopathy in 
      patients with diabetes who had had teleretinal diabetic retinopathy screening in 
      a primary care setting. The input for the two versions was either a set of 
      three-field or one-field colour fundus photographs. Of the 575 431 eyes in the 
      development set 28 899 had known outcomes, with the remaining 546 532 eyes used 
      to augment the training process via multitask learning. Validation was done on 
      one eye (selected at random) per patient from two datasets: an internal 
      validation (from EyePACS, a teleretinal screening service in the USA) set of 3678 
      eyes with known outcomes and an external validation (from Thailand) set of 2345 
      eyes with known outcomes. FINDINGS: The three-field deep-learning system had an 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·79 (95% CI 
      0·77-0·81) in the internal validation set. Assessment of the external validation 
      set-which contained only one-field colour fundus photographs-with the one-field 
      deep-learning system gave an AUC of 0·70 (0·67-0·74). In the internal validation 
      set, the AUC of available risk factors was 0·72 (0·68-0·76), which improved to 
      0·81 (0·77-0·84) after combining the deep-learning system with these risk factors 
      (p<0·0001). In the external validation set, the corresponding AUC improved from 
      0·62 (0·58-0·66) to 0·71 (0·68-0·75; p<0·0001) following the addition of the 
      deep-learning system to available risk factors. INTERPRETATION: The deep-learning 
      systems predicted diabetic retinopathy development using colour fundus 
      photographs, and the systems were independent of and more informative than 
      available risk factors. Such a risk stratification tool might help to optimise 
      screening intervals to reduce costs while improving vision-related outcomes.

AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is an important cause of visual impairment in the 
      working-age group. Deep learning methods have been developed to detect DME from 
      two-dimensional retinal images and also from optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      images. The performances of these algorithms vary and often create doubt 
      regarding their clinical utility. In resource-constrained health-care systems, 
      these algorithms may play an important role in determining referral and 
      treatment. The survey provides a diversified overview of macular edema detection 
      methods, including cutting-edge research, with the objective of providing 
      pertinent information to research groups, health-care professionals, and diabetic 
      patients about the applications of deep learning in retinal image detection and 
      classification process. Electronic databases such as PubMed, IEEE Explore, 
      BioMed, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to March 31, 2022, and 
      the reference lists of published papers were also searched. The study followed 
      the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) 
      reporting guidelines. Examination of various deep learning models and their 
      exhibition regarding precision, epochs, their capacity to detect anomalies for 
      less training data, concepts, and challenges that go deep into the applications 
      were analyzed. A total of 53 studies were included that evaluated the performance 
      of deep learning models in a total of 1,414,169°CT volumes, B-scans, patients, 
      and 472,328 fundus images. The overall area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.9727. The overall sensitivity for detecting 
      DME using OCT images was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-0.98). The 
      overall sensitivity for detecting DME using fundus images was 94% (95% CI: 
      0.90-0.96).

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a federated learning framework for deep 
      neural network-based retinal microvasculature segmentation and referable diabetic 
      retinopathy (RDR) classification using OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA). DESIGN: 
      Retrospective analysis of clinical OCT and OCTA scans of control participants and 
      patients with diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: The 153 OCTA en face images used for 
      microvasculature segmentation were acquired from 4 OCT instruments with fields of 
      view ranging from 2 × 2-mm to 6 × 6-mm. The 700 eyes used for RDR classification 
      consisted of OCTA en face images and structural OCT projections acquired from 2 
      commercial OCT systems. METHODS: OCT angiography images used for microvasculature 
      segmentation were delineated manually and verified by retina experts. Diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) severity was evaluated by retinal specialists and was condensed 
      into 2 classes: non-RDR and RDR. The federated learning configuration was 
      demonstrated via simulation using 4 clients for microvasculature segmentation and 
      was compared with other collaborative training methods. Subsequently, federated 
      learning was applied over multiple institutions for RDR classification and was 
      compared with models trained and tested on data from the same institution 
      (internal models) and different institutions (external models). MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: For microvasculature segmentation, we measured the accuracy and Dice 
      similarity coefficient (DSC). For severity classification, we measured accuracy, 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
      precision-recall curve, balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and 
      specificity. RESULTS: For both applications, federated learning achieved similar 
      performance as internal models. Specifically, for microvasculature segmentation, 
      the federated learning model achieved similar performance (mean DSC across all 
      test sets, 0.793) as models trained on a fully centralized dataset (mean DSC, 
      0.807). For RDR classification, federated learning achieved a mean AUROC of 0.954 
      and 0.960; the internal models attained a mean AUROC of 0.956 and 0.973. Similar 
      results are reflected in the other calculated evaluation metrics. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Federated learning showed similar results to traditional deep learning in both 
      applications of segmentation and classification, while maintaining data privacy. 
      Evaluation metrics highlight the potential of collaborative learning for 
      increasing domain diversity and the generalizability of models used for the 
      classification of OCT data.

TI  - Automated diabetic retinopathy screening for primary care settings using deep 
      learning.

LID - 10.1016/j.ibmed.2021.100045 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United 
      States and other high-income countries. Early detection is key to prevention, 
      which could be achieved effectively with a fully automated screening tool 
      performing well on clinically relevant measures in primary care settings. We have 
      built an artificial intelligence-based tool on a cloud-based platform for 
      large-scale screening of DR as referable or non-referable. In this paper, we aim 
      to validate this tool built using deep learning based techniques. The cloud-based 
      screening model was developed and tested using deep learning techniques with 
      88702 images from the Kaggle dataset and externally validated using 1748 
      high-resolution images of the retina (or fundus images) from the Messidor-2 
      dataset. For validation in the primary care settings, 264 images were taken 
      prospectively from two diabetes clinics in Queens, New York. The images were 
      uploaded to the cloud-based software for testing the automated system as compared 
      to expert ophthalmologists' evaluations of referable DR. Measures used were area 
      under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the screening model with 
      respect to professional graders. The screening system achieved a high sensitivity 
      of 99.21% and a specificity of 97.59% on the Kaggle test dataset with an AUC of 
      0.9992. The system was also externally validated in Messidor-2, where it achieved 
      a sensitivity of 97.63% and a specificity of 99.49% (AUC, 0.9985). On primary 
      care data, the sensitivity was 92.3% overall (12/13 referable images are 
      correctly identified), and overall specificity was 94.8% (233/251 non-referable 
      images). The proposed DR screening tool achieves state-of-the-art performance 
      among the publicly available datasets: Kaggle and Messidor-2 to the best of our 
      knowledge. The performance on various clinically relevant measures demonstrates 
      that the tool is suitable for screening and early diagnosis of DR in primary care 
      settings.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an ophthalmological disease that causes damage in 
      the blood vessels of the eye. DR causes clotting, lesions or haemorrhage in the 
      light-sensitive region of the retina. Person suffering from DR face loss of 
      vision due to the formation of exudates or lesions in the retina. The detection 
      of DR is critical to the successful treatment of patients suffering from DR. The 
      retinal fundus images may be used for the detection of abnormalities leading to 
      DR. In this paper, an automated ensemble deep learning model is proposed for the 
      detection and classification of DR. The ensembling of a deep learning model 
      enables better predictions and achieves better performance than any single 
      contributing model. Two deep learning models, namely modified DenseNet101 and 
      ResNeXt, are ensembled for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. The ResNeXt 
      model is an improvement over the existing ResNet models. The model includes a 
      shortcut from the previous block to next block, stacking layers and adapting 
      split-transform-merge strategy. The model has a cardinality parameter that 
      specifies the number of transformations. The DenseNet model gives better feature 
      use efficiency as the dense blocks perform concatenation. The ensembling of these 
      two models is performed using normalization over the classes followed by maximum 
      a posteriori over the class outputs to compute the final class label. The 
      experiments are conducted on two datasets APTOS19 and DIARETDB1. The 
      classifications are carried out for both two classes and five classes. The images 
      are pre-processed using CLAHE method for histogram equalization. The dataset has 
      a high-class imbalance and the images of the non-proliferative type are very low, 
      therefore, GAN-based augmentation technique is used for data augmentation. The 
      results obtained from the proposed method are compared with other existing 
      methods. The comparison shows that the proposed method has higher accuracy, 
      precision and recall for both two classes and five classes. The proposed method 
      has an accuracy of 86.08 for five classes and 96.98% for two classes. The 
      precision and recall for two classes are 0.97. For five classes also, the 
      precision and recall are high, i.e., 0.76 and 0.82, respectively.

TI  - Deep and Densely Connected Networks for Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics10010024 [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - Diabetes has recently emerged as a worldwide problem, and diabetic retinopathy is 
      an abnormal state associated with the human retina. Due to the increase in daily 
      screen-related activities of modern human beings, diabetic retinopathy is more 
      prevalent among adults, leading to minor and major blindness. Doctors and 
      clinicians are unable to perform early diagnoses due to the large number of 
      patients. To solve this problem, this study introduces a classification model for 
      retinal images that distinguishes between the various stages of diabetic 
      retinopathy. This work involves deploying deep and densely connected networks for 
      retinal image analysis with training from scratch. Dense connections between the 
      convolutional layers of the network are an essential factor to enhance accuracy 
      owing to the deeper supervision between layers. Another factor is the growth rate 
      that further assists our model in learning more sophisticated feature maps 
      regarding retinal images from every stage of the network. We compute the area 
      under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for messidor-2 and 
      EyePACS. Compared to existing approaches, our method achieved better results, 
      with an approximate rise rate of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively. Therefore, 
      computer-aided programs can help in diagnostic centers as automated detection 
      systems.

AB  - Diabetes is a globally prevalent disease that can cause visible microvascular 
      complications such as diabetic retinopathy and macular edema in the human eye 
      retina, the images of which are today used for manual disease screening and 
      diagnosis. This labor-intensive task could greatly benefit from automatic 
      detection using deep learning technique. Here we present a deep learning system 
      that identifies referable diabetic retinopathy comparably or better than 
      presented in the previous studies, although we use only a small fraction of 
      images (<1/4) in training but are aided with higher image resolutions. We also 
      provide novel results for five different screening and clinical grading systems 
      for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema classification, including 
      state-of-the-art results for accurately classifying images according to clinical 
      five-grade diabetic retinopathy and for the first time for the four-grade 
      diabetic macular edema scales. These results suggest, that a deep learning system 
      could increase the cost-effectiveness of screening and diagnosis, while attaining 
      higher than recommended performance, and that the system could be applied in 
      clinical examinations requiring finer grading.

AB  - Diabetic patients can also be identified immediately utilizing retinopathy 
      photos, but it is a challenging task. The blood veins visible in fundus 
      photographs are used in several disease diagnosis approaches. We sought to 
      replicate the findings published in implementation and verification of a deep 
      learning approach for diabetic retinopathy identification in retinal fundus 
      pictures. To address this issue, the suggested investigative study uses recurrent 
      neural networks (RNN) to retrieve characteristics from deep networks. As a 
      result, using computational approaches to identify certain disorders 
      automatically might be a fantastic solution. We developed and tested several 
      iterations of a deep learning framework to forecast the progression of diabetic 
      retinopathy in diabetic individuals who have undergone teleretinal diabetic 
      retinopathy assessment in a basic healthcare environment. A collection of 
      one-field or three-field colour fundus pictures served as the input for both 
      iterations. Utilizing the proposed DRNN methodology, advanced identification of 
      the diabetic state was performed utilizing HE detected in an eye's blood vessel. 
      This research demonstrates the difficulties in duplicating deep learning approach 
      findings, as well as the necessity for more reproduction and replication research 
      to verify deep learning techniques, particularly in the field of healthcare 
      picture processing. This development investigates the utilization of several 
      other Deep Neural Network Frameworks on photographs from the dataset after they 
      have been treated to suitable image computation methods such as local average 
      colour subtraction to assist in highlighting the germane characteristics from a 
      fundoscopy, thus, also enhancing the identification and assessment procedure of 
      diabetic retinopathy and serving as a skilled guidelines framework for 
      practitioners all over the globe.

TI  - The adoption of deep learning interpretability techniques on diabetic retinopathy 
      analysis: a review.
PG  - 633-642

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic eye condition that is rapidly growing due 
      to the prevalence of diabetes. There are challenges such as the dearth of 
      ophthalmologists, healthcare resources, and facilities that are unable to provide 
      patients with appropriate eye screening services. As a result, deep learning (DL) 
      has the potential to play a critical role as a powerful automated diagnostic tool 
      in the field of ophthalmology, particularly in the early detection of DR when 
      compared to traditional detection techniques. The DL models are known as black 
      boxes, despite the fact that they are widely adopted. They make no attempt to 
      explain how the model learns representations or why it makes a particular 
      prediction. Due to the black box design architecture, DL methods make it 
      difficult for intended end-users like ophthalmologists to grasp how the models 
      function, preventing model acceptance for clinical usage. Recently, several 
      studies on the interpretability of DL methods used in DR-related tasks such as DR 
      classification and segmentation have been published. The goal of this paper is to 
      provide a detailed overview of interpretability strategies used in DR-related 
      tasks. This paper also includes the authors' insights and future directions in 
      the field of DR to help the research community overcome research problems.

AB  - Background:To validate our deep learning algorithm (DLA) to read diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) retinographies.Introduction:Currently DR detection is made by 
      retinography; due to its increasing diabetes mellitus incidence we need to find 
      systems that help us to screen DR.Materials and Methods:The DLA was built and 
      trained using 88,702 images from EyePACS, 1,748 from Messidor-2, and 19,230 from 
      our own population. For validation a total of 38,339 retinographies from 17,669 
      patients (obtained from our DR screening databases) were read by a DLA and 
      compared by four senior retina ophthalmologists for detecting any-DR and 
      referable-DR. We determined the values of Cohen's weighted Kappa (CWK) index, 
      sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative 
      predictive value (NPV), and errors type I and II.Results:The results of the DLA 
      to detect any-DR were: CWK = 0.886 ± 0.004 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.879-0.894), S = 0.967%, SP = 0.976%, PPV = 0.836%, and NPV = 0.996%. The error 
      type I = 0.024, and the error type II = 0.004. Likewise, the referable-DR results 
      were: CWK = 0.809 (95% CI 0.798-0.819), S = 0.998, SP = 0.968, PPV = 0.701, 
      NPV = 0.928, error type I = 0.032, and error type II = 0.001.Discussion:Our DLA 
      can be used as a high confidence diagnostic tool to help in DR screening, 
      especially when it might be difficult for ophthalmologists or other professionals 
      to identify. It can identify patients with any-DR and those that should be 
      referred.Conclusions:The DLA can be valid to aid in screening of DR.

AB  - Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), 
      drusen, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and diabetic macular edema (DME) are 
      significant causes of visual impairment globally. Optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) imaging has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for these ocular 
      conditions. However, subjective interpretation and inter-observer variability 
      highlight the need for standardized diagnostic approaches. Methods This study 
      aimed to develop a robust deep learning model using artificial intelligence (AI) 
      techniques for the automated detection of drusen, CNV, and DME in OCT images. A 
      diverse dataset of 1,528 OCT images from Kaggle.com was used for model training. 
      The performance metrics, including precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, 
      F1 score, and overall accuracy, were assessed to evaluate the model's 
      effectiveness. Results The developed model achieved high precision (0.99), recall 
      (0.962), sensitivity (0.985), specificity (0.987), F1 score (0.971), and overall 
      accuracy (0.987) in classifying diseased and healthy OCT images. These results 
      demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the model in distinguishing between 
      retinal pathologies. Conclusion The study concludes that the developed deep 
      learning model using AI techniques is highly effective in the automated detection 
      of drusen, CNV, and DME in OCT images. Further validation studies and research 
      efforts are necessary to evaluate the generalizability and integration of the 
      model into clinical practice. Collaboration between clinicians, policymakers, and 
      researchers is essential for advancing diagnostic tools and management strategies 
      for AMD and DR. Integrating this technology into clinical workflows can 
      positively impact patient care, particularly in settings with limited access to 
      ophthalmologists. Future research should focus on collecting independent 
      datasets, addressing potential biases, and assessing real-world effectiveness. 
      Overall, the use of machine learning algorithms in conjunction with OCT imaging 
      holds great potential for improving the detection and management of drusen, CNV, 
      and DME, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and vision preservation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of ensemble learning techniques with deep learning 
      in classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) in optical coherence tomography 
      angiography (OCTA) images and their corresponding co-registered structural 
      images. METHODS: A total of 463 volumes from 380 eyes were acquired using the 3 × 
      3-mm OCTA protocol on the Zeiss Plex Elite system. Enface images of the 
      superficial and deep capillary plexus were exported from both the optical 
      coherence tomography and OCTA data. Component neural networks were constructed 
      using single data-types and fine-tuned using VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet 
      architectures pretrained on ImageNet weights. These networks were then ensembled 
      using majority soft voting and stacking techniques. Results were compared with a 
      classifier using manually engineered features. Class activation maps (CAMs) were 
      created using the original CAM algorithm and Grad-CAM. RESULTS: The networks 
      trained with the VGG19 architecture outperformed the networks trained on deeper 
      architectures. Ensemble networks constructed using the four fine-tuned VGG19 
      architectures achieved accuracies of 0.92 and 0.90 for the majority soft voting 
      and stacking methods respectively. Both ensemble methods outperformed the highest 
      single data-type network and the network trained on hand-crafted features. 
      Grad-CAM was shown to more accurately highlight areas of disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ensemble learning increases the predictive accuracy of CNNs for classifying 
      referable DR on OCTA datasets. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Because the diagnostic 
      accuracy of OCTA images is shown to be greater than the manually extracted 
      features currently used in the literature, the proposed methods may be beneficial 
      toward developing clinically valuable solutions for DR diagnoses.

AB  - The global burden of diabetic retinopathy (DR) continues to worsen and DR remains 
      a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Here, we describe an algorithm to 
      predict DR progression by means of deep learning (DL), using as input color 
      fundus photographs (CFPs) acquired at a single visit from a patient with DR. The 
      proposed DL models were designed to predict future DR progression, defined as 
      2-step worsening on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Severity Scale, and were trained against DR severity scores assessed after 6, 12, 
      and 24 months from the baseline visit by masked, well-trained, human reading 
      center graders. The performance of one of these models (prediction at month 12) 
      resulted in an area under the curve equal to 0.79. Interestingly, our results 
      highlight the importance of the predictive signal located in the peripheral 
      retinal fields, not routinely collected for DR assessments, and the importance of 
      microvascular abnormalities. Our findings show the feasibility of predicting 
      future DR progression by leveraging CFPs of a patient acquired at a single visit. 
      Upon further development on larger and more diverse datasets, such an algorithm 
      could enable early diagnosis and referral to a retina specialist for more 
      frequent monitoring and even consideration of early intervention. Moreover, it 
      could also improve patient recruitment for clinical trials targeting DR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a real-world screening, guideline-based deep 
      learning (DL) system for referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection. DESIGN: 
      This is a multicentre platform development study based on retrospective, 
      cross-sectional data sets. Images were labelled by two-level certificated graders 
      as the ground truth. According to the UK DR screening guideline, a DL model based 
      on colour retinal images with five-dimensional classifiers, namely image quality, 
      retinopathy, maculopathy gradability, maculopathy and photocoagulation, was 
      developed. Referable decisions were generated by integrating the output of all 
      classifiers and reported at the image, eye and patient level. The performance of 
      the DL was compared with DR experts. SETTING: DR screening programmes from three 
      hospitals and the Lifeline Express Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program in 
      China. PARTICIPANTS: 83 465 images of 39 836 eyes from 21 716 patients were 
      annotated, of which 53 211 images were used as the development set and 30 254 
      images were used as the external validation set, split based on centre and 
      period. MAIN OUTCOMES: Accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
      precision-recall curve (AUPRC), Cohen's unweighted κ and Gwet's AC1 were 
      calculated to evaluate the performance of the DL algorithm. RESULTS: In the 
      external validation set, the five classifiers achieved an accuracy of 
      0.915-0.980, F1 score of 0.682-0.966, sensitivity of 0.917-0.978, specificity of 
      0.907-0.981, AUROC of 0.9639-0.9944 and AUPRC of 0.7504-0.9949. Referable DR at 
      three levels was detected with an accuracy of 0.918-0.967, F1 score of 
      0.822-0.918, sensitivity of 0.970-0.971, specificity of 0.905-0.967, AUROC of 
      0.9848-0.9931 and AUPRC of 0.9527-0.9760. With reference to the ground truth, the 
      DL system showed comparable performance (Cohen's κ: 0.86-0.93; Gwet's AC1: 
      0.89-0.94) with three DR experts (Cohen's κ: 0.89-0.96; Gwet's AC1: 0.91-0.97) in 
      detecting referable lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The automatic DL system for detection 
      of referable DR based on the UK guideline could achieve high accuracy in 
      multidimensional classifications. It is suitable for large-scale, real-world DR 
      screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global health concern 
      among diabetic patients. The objective of this study was to propose an 
      explainable machine learning (ML)-based system for predicting the risk of DR. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study utilized publicly available cross-sectional 
      data in a Chinese cohort of 6374 respondents. We employed boruta and least 
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature selection methods 
      to identify the common predictors of DR. Using the identified predictors, we 
      trained and optimized four widly applicable models (artificial neural network, 
      support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to 
      predict patients with DR. Moreover, shapely additive explanation (SHAP) was 
      adopted to show the contribution of each predictor of DR in the prediction. 
      RESULTS: Combining Boruta and LASSO method revealed that community, TCTG, HDLC, 
      BUN, FPG, HbAlc, weight, and duration were the most important predictors of DR. 
      The XGBoost-based model outperformed the other models, with an accuracy of 
      90.01%, precision of 91.80%, recall of 97.91%, F1 score of 94.86%, and AUC of 
      0.850. Moreover, SHAP method showed that HbA1c, community, FPG, TCTG, duration, 
      and UA1b were the influencing predictors of DR. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      integrating system will be helpful as a tool for selecting significant 
      predictors, which can predict patients who are at high risk of DR at an early 
      stage in China.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic eye disease 
      worldwide and a leading cause of blindness. The number of diabetic patients will 
      increase to 552 million by 2034, as per the International Diabetes Federation 
      (IDF). AIM: With advances in computer science techniques, such as artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), opportunities for the detection of DR 
      at the early stages have increased. This increase means that the chances of 
      recovery will increase and the possibility of vision loss in patients will be 
      reduced in the future. METHODS: In this paper, deep transfer learning models for 
      medical DR detection were investigated. The DL models were trained and tested 
      over the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 dataset. According 
      to literature surveys, this research is considered one the first studies to use 
      of the APTOS 2019 dataset, as it was freshly published in the second quarter of 
      2019. The selected deep transfer models in this research were AlexNet, Res-Net18, 
      SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19. These models were selected, as they 
      consist of a small number of layers when compared to larger models, such as 
      DenseNet and InceptionResNet. Data augmentation techniques were used to render 
      the models more robust and to overcome the overfitting problem. RESULTS: The 
      testing accuracy and performance metrics, such as the precision, recall, and F1 
      score, were calculated to prove the robustness of the selected models. The 
      AlexNet model achieved the highest testing accuracy at 97.9%. In addition, the 
      achieved performance metrics strengthened our achieved results. Moreover, AlexNet 
      has a minimum number of layers, which decreases the training time and the 
      computational complexity.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning image assessment software VeriSee™ and to 
      validate its accuracy in grading the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      METHODS: Diabetic patients who underwent single-field, nonmydriatic, 45-degree 
      color retinal fundus photography at National Taiwan University Hospital between 
      July 2007 and June 2017 were retrospectively recruited. A total of 7524 judgeable 
      color fundus images were collected and were graded for the severity of DR by 
      ophthalmologists. Among these pictures, 5649 along with another 31,612 color 
      fundus images from the EyePACS dataset were used for model training of VeriSee™. 
      The other 1875 images were used for validation and were graded for the severity 
      of DR by VeriSee™, ophthalmologists, and internal physicians. Area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for VeriSee™, and the sensitivities 
      and specificities for VeriSee™, ophthalmologists, and internal physicians in 
      diagnosing DR were calculated. RESULTS: The AUCs for VeriSee™ in diagnosing any 
      DR, referable DR and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were 0.955, 0.955 
      and 0.984, respectively. VeriSee™ had better sensitivities in diagnosing any DR 
      and PDR (92.2% and 90.9%, respectively) than internal physicians (64.3% and 
      20.6%, respectively) (P < 0.001 for both). VeriSee™ also had better sensitivities 
      in diagnosing any DR and referable DR (92.2% and 89.2%, respectively) than 
      ophthalmologists (86.9% and 71.1%, respectively) (P < 0.001 for both), while 
      ophthalmologists had better specificities. CONCLUSION: VeriSee™ had good 
      sensitivity and specificity in grading the severity of DR from color fundus 
      images. It may offer clinical assistance to non-ophthalmologists in DR screening 
      with nonmydriatic retinal fundus photography.

TI  - Identification of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Weighted Fusion Deep Learning Based 
      on Dual-Channel Fundus Scans.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020540 [doi]
LID - 540
AB  - It is a well-known fact that diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common 
      causes of visual impairment between the ages of 25 and 74 around the globe. 
      Diabetes is caused by persistently high blood glucose levels, which leads to 
      blood vessel aggravations and vision loss. Early diagnosis can minimise the risk 
      of proliferated diabetic retinopathy, which is the advanced level of this 
      disease, and having higher risk of severe impairment. Therefore, it becomes 
      important to classify DR stages. To this effect, this paper presents a weighted 
      fusion deep learning network (WFDLN) to automatically extract features and 
      classify DR stages from fundus scans. The proposed framework aims to treat the 
      issue of low quality and identify retinopathy symptoms in fundus images. Two 
      channels of fundus images, namely, the contrast-limited adaptive histogram 
      equalization (CLAHE) fundus images and the contrast-enhanced canny edge detection 
      (CECED) fundus images are processed by WFDLN. Fundus-related features of CLAHE 
      images are extracted by fine-tuned Inception V3, whereas the features of CECED 
      fundus images are extracted using fine-tuned VGG-16. Both channels' outputs are 
      merged in a weighted approach, and softmax classification is used to determine 
      the final recognition result. Experimental results show that the proposed network 
      can identify the DR stages with high accuracy. The proposed method tested on the 
      Messidor dataset reports an accuracy level of 98.5%, sensitivity of 98.9%, and 
      specificity of 98.0%, whereas on the Kaggle dataset, the proposed model reports 
      an accuracy level of 98.0%, sensitivity of 98.7%, and specificity of 97.8%. 
      Compared with other models, our proposed network achieves comparable performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were investigated 
      extensively in the past studies, but it remains unknown which risk factors were 
      more associated with the DR than others. If we can detect the DR related risk 
      factors more accurately, we can then exercise early prevention strategies for 
      diabetic retinopathy in the most high-risk population. The purpose of this study 
      is to build a prediction model for the DR in type 2 diabetes mellitus using data 
      mining techniques including the support vector machines, decision trees, 
      artificial neural networks, and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Experimental 
      results demonstrated that prediction performance by support vector machines 
      performed better than the other machine learning algorithms and achieved 79.5% 
      and 0.839 in accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      using percentage split (i.e., data set divided into 80% as trainning and 20% as 
      test), respectively. Evaluated by three-way data split scheme (i.e., data set 
      divided into 60% as training, 20% as validation, and 20% as independent test), 
      our method obtained slightly lower performance compared to percentage split, 
      which suggested that three-way data split is a better way to evaluate the real 
      performance and prevent overestimation. Moreover, we incorporated approaches 
      proposed in previous studies to evaluate our data set and our prediction 
      performance outperformed the other previous studies in most evaluation measures. 
      This lends support to our assumption that appropriate machine learning algorithms 
      combined with discriminative clinical features can effectively detect diabetic 
      retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Our method identifies use of insulin and duration of 
      diabetes as novel interpretable features to assist with clinical decisions in 
      identifying the high-risk populations for diabetic retinopathy. If duration of DM 
      increases by 1 year, the odds ratio to have DMR is increased by 9.3%. The odds 
      ratio to have DR is increased by 3.561 times for patients who use insulin 
      compared to patients who do not use insulin. Our results can be used to 
      facilitate development of clinical decision support systems for clinical practice 
      in the future.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading is crucial in determining the adequate 
      treatment and follow up of patient, but the screening process can be tiresome and 
      prone to errors. Deep learning approaches have shown promising performance as 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, but their black-box behaviour hinders 
      clinical application. We propose DR|GRADUATE, a novel deep learning-based DR 
      grading CAD system that supports its decision by providing a medically 
      interpretable explanation and an estimation of how uncertain that prediction is, 
      allowing the ophthalmologist to measure how much that decision should be trusted. 
      We designed DR|GRADUATE taking into account the ordinal nature of the DR grading 
      problem. A novel Gaussian-sampling approach built upon a Multiple Instance 
      Learning framework allow DR|GRADUATE to infer an image grade associated with an 
      explanation map and a prediction uncertainty while being trained only with 
      image-wise labels. DR|GRADUATE was trained on the Kaggle DR detection training 
      set and evaluated across multiple datasets. In DR grading, a quadratic-weighted 
      Cohen's kappa (κ) between 0.71 and 0.84 was achieved in five different datasets. 
      We show that high κ values occur for images with low prediction uncertainty, thus 
      indicating that this uncertainty is a valid measure of the predictions' quality. 
      Further, bad quality images are generally associated with higher uncertainties, 
      showing that images not suitable for diagnosis indeed lead to less trustworthy 
      predictions. Additionally, tests on unfamiliar medical image data types suggest 
      that DR|GRADUATE allows outlier detection. The attention maps generally highlight 
      regions of interest for diagnosis. These results show the great potential of 
      DR|GRADUATE as a second-opinion system in DR severity grading.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision impairment in diabetic 
      patients worldwide. Due to its prevalence, early clinical diagnosis is essential 
      to improve treatment management of DR patients. Despite recent demonstration of 
      successful machine learning (ML) models for automated DR detection, there is a 
      significant clinical need for robust models that can be trained with smaller 
      cohorts of dataset and still perform with high diagnostic accuracy in independent 
      clinical datasets (i.e., high model generalizability). Towards this need, we have 
      developed a self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) based pipeline for 
      classification of referable vs non-referable DR. Self-supervised CL based 
      pretraining allows enhanced data representation, therefore, the development of 
      robust and generalized deep learning (DL) models, even with small, labeled 
      datasets. We have integrated a neural style transfer (NST) augmentation in the CL 
      pipeline to produce models with better representations and initializations for 
      the detection of DR in color fundus images. We compare our CL pretrained model 
      performance with two state of the art baseline models pretrained with Imagenet 
      weights. We further investigate the model performance with reduced labeled 
      training data (down to 10 percent) to test the robustness of the model when 
      trained with small, labeled datasets. The model is trained and validated on the 
      EyePACS dataset and tested independently on clinical datasets from the University 
      of Illinois, Chicago (UIC). Compared to baseline models, our CL pretrained 
      FundusNet model had higher area under the receiver operating characteristics 
      (ROC) curve (AUC) (CI) values (0.91 (0.898 to 0.930) vs 0.80 (0.783 to 0.820) and 
      0.83 (0.801 to 0.853) on UIC data). At 10 percent labeled training data, the 
      FundusNet AUC was 0.81 (0.78 to 0.84) vs 0.58 (0.56 to 0.64) and 0.63 (0.60 to 
      0.66) in baseline models, when tested on the UIC dataset. CL based pretraining 
      with NST significantly improves DL classification performance, helps the model 
      generalize well (transferable from EyePACS to UIC data), and allows training with 
      small, annotated datasets, therefore reducing ground truth annotation burden of 
      the clinicians.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the accuracy and efficacy of a semi-automated deep learning 
      algorithm (DLA) assisted approach to detect vision-threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). Methods: We developed a two-step semi-automated DLA-assisted 
      approach to grade fundus photographs for vision-threatening referable DR. Study 
      images were obtained from the Lingtou Cohort Study, and captured at participant 
      enrollment in 2009-2010 ("baseline images") and annual follow-up between 2011 and 
      2017. To begin, a validated DLA automatically graded baseline images for 
      referable DR and classified them as positive, negative, or ungradable. Following, 
      each positive image, all other available images from patients who had a positive 
      image, and a 5% random sample of all negative images were selected and regraded 
      by trained human graders. A reference standard diagnosis was assigned once all 
      graders achieved consistent grading outcomes or with a senior ophthalmologist's 
      final diagnosis. The semi-automated DLA assisted approach combined initial DLA 
      screening and subsequent human grading for images identified as high-risk. This 
      approach was further validated within the follow-up image datasets and its time 
      and economic costs evaluated against fully human grading. Results: For evaluation 
      of baseline images, a total of 33,115 images were included and automatically 
      graded by the DLA. 2,604 images (480 positive results, 624 available other images 
      from participants with a positive result, and 1500 random negative samples) were 
      selected and regraded by graders. The DLA achieved an area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 
      0.953, 0.970, 0.879, and 88.6%, respectively. In further validation within the 
      follow-up image datasets, a total of 88,363 images were graded using this 
      semi-automated approach and human grading was performed on 8975 selected images. 
      The DLA achieved an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.914, 0.852, 0.853, 
      respectively. Compared against fully human grading, the semi-automated 
      DLA-assisted approach achieved an estimated 75.6% time and 90.1% economic cost 
      saving. Conclusions: The DLA described in this study was able to achieve high 
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in grading fundus images for referable DR. 
      Validated against long-term follow-up datasets, a semi-automated DLA-assisted 
      approach was able to accurately identify suspect cases, and minimize misdiagnosis 
      whilst balancing safety, time, and economic cost.

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from Fundus Images of the Eye Using Hybrid Deep 
      Learning Features.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071607 [doi]
LID - 1607
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition present in patients suffering 
      from long-term diabetes. If a diagnosis is not carried out at an early stage, it 
      can lead to vision impairment. High blood sugar in diabetic patients is the main 
      source of DR. This affects the blood vessels within the retina. Manual detection 
      of DR is a difficult task since it can affect the retina, causing structural 
      changes such as Microaneurysms (MAs), Exudates (EXs), Hemorrhages (HMs), and 
      extra blood vessel growth. In this work, a hybrid technique for the detection and 
      classification of Diabetic Retinopathy in fundus images of the eye is proposed. 
      Transfer learning (TL) is used on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
      models to extract features that are combined to generate a hybrid feature vector. 
      This feature vector is passed on to various classifiers for binary and multiclass 
      classification of fundus images. System performance is measured using various 
      metrics and results are compared with recent approaches for DR detection. The 
      proposed method provides significant performance improvement in DR detection for 
      fundus images. For binary classification, the proposed modified method achieved 
      the highest accuracy of 97.8% and 89.29% for multiclass classification.

      Fundus Image Dataset.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12123084 [doi]
LID - 3084
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy affects one-third of all diabetic patients and may cause 
      vision impairment. It has four stages of progression, i.e., mild 
      non-proliferative, moderate non-proliferative, severe non-proliferative and 
      proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. The disease has no noticeable symptoms at 
      early stages and may lead to chronic destruction, thus causing permanent 
      blindness if not detected at an early stage. The proposed research provides deep 
      learning frameworks for autonomous detection of Diabetic Retinopathy at an early 
      stage using fundus images. The first framework consists of cascaded neural 
      networks, spanned in three layers where each layer classifies data into two 
      classes, one is the desired stage and the other output is passed to another 
      classifier until the input image is classified as one of the stages. The second 
      framework takes normalized, HSV and RGB fundus images as input to three 
      Convolutional Neural Networks, and the resultant probabilistic vectors are 
      averaged together to obtain the final output of the input image. Third framework 
      used the Long Short Term Memory Module in CNN to emphasize the network in 
      remembering information over a long time span. Proposed frameworks were tested 
      and compared on the large-scale Kaggle fundus image dataset EYEPAC. The 
      evaluations have shown that the second framework outperformed others and achieved 
      an accuracy of 78.06% and 83.78% without and with augmentation, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 10-24% of patients with diabetes 
      mellitus type 1 or 2 in the primary care (PC) sector. As early detection is 
      crucial for treatment, deep learning screening methods in PC setting could 
      potentially aid in an accurate and timely diagnosis. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      meta-analysis was to determine the current state of knowledge regarding deep 
      learning (DL) screening methods for DR in PC. DATA SOURCES: A systematic 
      literature search was conducted using Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus to 
      identify suitable studies. STUDY SELECTION: Suitable studies were selected by two 
      researchers independently. Studies assessing DL methods and the suitability of 
      these screening systems (diagnostic parameters such as sensitivity and 
      specificity, information on datasets and setting) in PC were selected. Excluded 
      were studies focusing on lesions, applying conventional diagnostic imaging tools, 
      conducted in secondary or tertiary care, and all publication types other than 
      original research studies on human subjects. DATA EXTRACTION: The following data 
      was extracted from included studies: authors, title, year of publication, 
      objectives, participants, setting, type of intervention/method, reference 
      standard, grading scale, outcome measures, dataset, risk of bias, and performance 
      measures. DATA SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSION: The summed sensitivity of all included 
      studies was 87% and specificity was 90%. Given a prevalence of DR of 10% in 
      patients with DM Type 2 in PC, the negative predictive value is 98% while the 
      positive predictive value is 49%. LIMITATIONS: Selected studies showed a high 
      variation in sample size and quality and quantity of available data.

TI  - Necessity of Local Modification for Deep Learning Algorithms to Predict Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031204 [doi]
LID - 1204
AB  - Deep learning (DL) algorithms are used to diagnose diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      However, most of these algorithms have been trained using global data or data 
      from patients of a single region. Using different model architectures (e.g., 
      Inception-v3, ResNet101, and DenseNet121), we assessed the necessity of modifying 
      the algorithms for universal society screening. We used the open-source dataset 
      from the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition to develop a model for 
      the detection of DR severity. We used a local dataset from Taipei City Hospital 
      to verify the necessity of model localization and validated the three 
      aforementioned models with local datasets. The experimental results revealed that 
      Inception-v3 outperformed ResNet101 and DenseNet121 with a foreign global 
      dataset, whereas DenseNet121 outperformed Inception-v3 and ResNet101 with the 
      local dataset. The quadratic weighted kappa score (κ) was used to evaluate the 
      model performance. All models had 5-8% higher κ for the local dataset than for 
      the foreign dataset. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that, compared with the 
      local ophthalmologists' diagnoses, the severity predicted by the three models was 
      overestimated. Thus, DL algorithms using artificial intelligence based on global 
      data must be locally modified to ensure the applicability of a well-trained model 
      to make diagnoses in clinical environments.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of preventable 
      blindness globally. Performing retinal screening examinations on all diabetic 
      patients is an unmet need, and there are many undiagnosed and untreated cases of 
      DR. The objective of this study was to develop robust diagnostic technology to 
      automate DR screening. Referral of eyes with DR to an ophthalmologist for further 
      evaluation and treatment would aid in reducing the rate of vision loss, enabling 
      timely and accurate diagnoses. DESIGN: We developed and evaluated a data-driven 
      deep learning algorithm as a novel diagnostic tool for automated DR detection. 
      The algorithm processed color fundus images and classified them as healthy 
      (no retinopathy) or having DR, identifying relevant cases for medical referral. 
      METHODS: A total of 75 137 publicly available fundus images from diabetic 
      patients were used to train and test an artificial intelligence model to 
      differentiate healthy fundi from those with DR. A panel of retinal specialists 
      determined the ground truth for our data set before experimentation. We also 
      tested our model using the public MESSIDOR 2 and E-Ophtha databases for external 
      validation. Information learned in our automated method was visualized readily 
      through an automatically generated abnormality heatmap, highlighting subregions 
      within each input fundus image for further clinical review. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as 
      a metric to measure the precision-recall trade-off of our algorithm, reporting 
      associated sensitivity and specificity metrics on the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve. RESULTS: Our model achieved a 0.97 AUC with a 94% and 98% 
      sensitivity and specificity, respectively, on 5-fold cross-validation using our 
      local data set. Testing against the independent MESSIDOR 2 and E-Ophtha databases 
      achieved a 0.94 and 0.95 AUC score, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A fully 
      data-driven artificial intelligence-based grading algorithm can be used to screen 
      fundus photographs obtained from diabetic patients and to identify, with high 
      reliability, which cases should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further 
      evaluation and treatment. The implementation of such an algorithm on a global 
      basis could reduce drastically the rate of vision loss attributed to DR.

      Retinopathy and Glaucoma.
PG  - 288-292
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.6035 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Convolutional neural networks have recently been applied to 
      ophthalmic diseases; however, the rationale for the outputs generated by these 
      systems is inscrutable to clinicians. A visualization tool is needed that would 
      enable clinicians to understand important exposure variables in real time. 
      OBJECTIVE: To systematically visualize the convolutional neural networks of 2 
      validated deep learning models for the detection of referable diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) and glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: The GON and referable DR algorithms were previously developed and 
      validated (holdout method) using 48 116 and 66 790 retinal photographs, 
      respectively, derived from a third-party database (LabelMe) of deidentified 
      photographs from various clinical settings in China. In the present 
      cross-sectional study, a random sample of 100 true-positive photographs and all 
      false-positive cases from each of the GON and DR validation data sets were 
      selected. All data were collected from March to June 2017. The original color 
      fundus images were processed using an adaptive kernel visualization technique. 
      The images were preprocessed by applying a sliding window with a size of 28 × 28 
      pixels and a stride of 3 pixels to crop images into smaller subimages to produce 
      a feature map. Threshold scales were adjusted to optimal levels for each model to 
      generate heat maps highlighting localized landmarks on the input image. A single 
      optometrist allocated each image to predefined categories based on the generated 
      heat map. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Visualization regions of the fundus. 
      RESULTS: In the GON data set, 90 of 100 true-positive cases (90%; 95% CI, 
      82%-95%) and 15 of 22 false-positive cases (68%; 95% CI, 45%-86%) displayed heat 
      map visualization within regions of the optic nerve head only. Lesions typically 
      seen in cases of referable DR (exudate, hemorrhage, or vessel abnormality) were 
      identified as the most important prognostic regions in 96 of 100 true-positive DR 
      cases (96%; 95% CI, 90%-99%). In 39 of 46 false-positive DR cases (85%; 95% CI, 
      71%-94%), the heat map displayed visualization of nontraditional fundus regions 
      with or without retinal venules. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings 
      suggest that this visualization method can highlight traditional regions in 
      disease diagnosis, substantiating the validity of the deep learning models 
      investigated. This visualization technique may promote the clinical adoption of 
      these models.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common eye retinal disease that is widely spread 
      all over the world. It leads to the complete loss of vision based on the level of 
      severity. It damages both retinal blood vessels and the eye's microscopic 
      interior layers. To avoid such issues, early detection of DR is essential in 
      association with routine screening methods to discover mild causes in manual 
      initiation. But these diagnostic procedures are extremely difficult and 
      expensive. The unique contributions of the study include the following: first, 
      providing detailed background of the DR disease and the traditional detection 
      techniques. Second, the various imaging techniques and deep learning applications 
      in DR are presented. Third, the different use cases and real-life scenarios are 
      explored relevant to DR detection wherein deep learning techniques have been 
      implemented. The study finally highlights the potential research opportunities 
      for researchers to explore and deliver effective performance results in diabetic 
      retinopathy detection.

AB  - One of the fields of medicine in which artificial intelligence techniques have 
      made progress is ophthalmology. Artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications for 
      preventing vision loss in eye illnesses have developed quickly. Artificial 
      intelligence uses computer programs to execute various activities while mimicking 
      human thought. Machine learning techniques are frequently utilized in the field 
      of ophthalmology. Ophthalmology holds great promise for advancing artificial 
      intelligence, thanks to various digital methods like optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) and visual field testing. Artificial intelligence has been used in 
      ophthalmology to treat eye conditions impairing vision, including macular holes 
      (M.H.), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, 
      and cataracts. The more common occurrence of these diseases has led to artificial 
      intelligence development. It is important to get annual screenings to detect eye 
      diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular 
      degeneration. These conditions can cause decreased visual acuity, and it is 
      necessary to identify any changes or progression in the disease to receive 
      appropriate treatment. Numerous studies have been conducted based on artificial 
      intelligence using different algorithms to improve and simplify current medical 
      practice and for early detection of eye diseases to prevent vision loss.

AB  - Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by retinal lesions affecting 
      people having diabetes for several years. It is one of the leading causes of 
      visual impairment worldwide. To diagnose this disease, ophthalmologists need to 
      manually analyze retinal fundus images. Computer-aided diagnosis systems can help 
      alleviate this burden by automatically detecting DR on retinal images, thus 
      saving physicians' precious time and reducing costs. The objective of this study 
      is to develop a deep learning algorithm capable of detecting DR on retinal fundus 
      images. Nine public datasets and more than 90,000 images are used to assess the 
      efficiency of the proposed technique. In addition, an explainability algorithm is 
      developed to visually show the DR signs detected by the deep model. Approach: The 
      proposed deep learning algorithm fine-tunes a pretrained deep convolutional 
      neural network for DR detection. The model is trained on a subset of EyePACS 
      dataset using a cosine annealing strategy for decaying the learning rate with 
      warm up, thus improving the training accuracy. Tests are conducted on the nine 
      datasets. An explainability algorithm based on gradient-weighted class activation 
      mapping is developed to visually show the signs selected by the model to classify 
      the retina images as DR. Result: The proposed network leads to higher 
      classification rates with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.986, sensitivity = 
      0.958, and specificity = 0.971 for EyePACS. For MESSIDOR, MESSIDOR-2, DIARETDB0, 
      DIARETDB1, STARE, IDRID, E-ophtha, and UoA-DR, the AUC is 0.963, 0.979, 0.986, 
      0.988, 0.964, 0.957, 0.984, and 0.990, respectively. Conclusions: The obtained 
      results achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform past published works 
      relying on training using only publicly available datasets. The proposed approach 
      can robustly classify fundus images and detect DR. An explainability model was 
      developed and showed that our model was able to efficiently identify different 
      signs of DR and detect this health issue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aiming to investigate diabetic retinopathy (DR) risk factors and 
      predictive models by machine learning using a large sample dataset. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective study based on a large sample and a high dimensional database. 
      SETTING: A Chinese central tertiary hospital in Beijing. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Information on 32 452 inpatients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 
      retrieved from the electronic medical record system from 1 January 2013 to 31 
      December 2017. METHODS: Sixty variables (including demography information, 
      physical and laboratory measurements, system diseases and insulin treatments) 
      were retained for baseline analysis. The optimal 17 variables were selected by 
      recursive feature elimination. The prediction model was built based on XGBoost 
      algorithm, and it was compared with three other popular machine learning 
      techniques: logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine. In 
      order to explain the results of XGBoost model more visually, the Shapley Additive 
      exPlanation (SHAP) method was used. RESULTS: DR occurred in 2038 (6.28%) T2DM 
      patients. The XGBoost model was identified as the best prediction model with the 
      highest AUC (area under the curve value, 0.90) and showed that an HbA1c value 
      greater than 8%, nephropathy, a serum creatinine value greater than 100 µmol/L, 
      insulin treatment and diabetic lower extremity arterial disease were associated 
      with an increased risk of DR. A patient's age over 65 was associated with a 
      decreased risk of DR. CONCLUSIONS: With better comprehensive performance, XGBoost 
      model had high reliability to assess risk indicators of DR. The most critical 
      risk factors of DR and the cut-off of risk factors can be found by SHAP method to 
      render the output of the XGBoost model clinically interpretable.

AB  - As the prevalence of diabetes increases, millions of people need to be screened 
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Remarkable advances in technology have made it 
      possible to use artificial intelligence to screen DR from retinal images with 
      high accuracy and reliability, resulting in reducing human labor by processing 
      large amounts of data in a shorter time. We developed a fully automated 
      classification algorithm to diagnose DR and identify referable status using 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) model and verified its feasibility by comparing its performance 
      with that of conventional machine learning model. Ground truths for 
      classifications were made based on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography to 
      increase the accuracy of data annotation. The proposed CNN classifier achieved an 
      accuracy of 91-98%, a sensitivity of 86-97%, a specificity of 94-99%, and an area 
      under the curve of 0.919-0.976. In the external validation, overall similar 
      performances were also achieved. The results were similar regardless of the size 
      and depth of the OCTA images, indicating that DR could be satisfactorily 
      classified even with images comprising narrow area of the macular region and a 
      single image slab of retina. The CNN-based classification using OCTA is expected 
      to create a novel diagnostic workflow for DR detection and referral.

TI  - Recognition of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema using deep learning.
LID - 10.1007/s11517-024-03105-z [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are both serious eye 
      conditions associated with diabetes and if left untreated, and they can lead to 
      permanent blindness. Traditional methods for screening these conditions rely on 
      manual image analysis by experts, which can be time-consuming and costly due to 
      the scarcity of such experts. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we 
      present the Modified CornerNet approach with DenseNet-100. This system aims to 
      localize and classify lesions associated with DR and DME. To train our model, we 
      first generate annotations for input samples. These annotations likely include 
      information about the location and type of lesions within the retinal images. 
      DenseNet-100 is a deep CNN used for feature extraction, and CornerNet is a 
      one-stage object detection model. CornerNet is known for its ability to 
      accurately localize small objects, which makes it suitable for detecting lesions 
      in retinal images. We assessed our technique on two challenging datasets, EyePACS 
      and IDRiD. These datasets contain a diverse range of retinal images, which is 
      important to estimate the performance of our model. Further, the proposed model 
      is also tested in the cross-corpus scenario on two challenging datasets named 
      APTOS-2019 and Diaretdb1 to assess the generalizability of our system. According 
      to the accomplished analysis, our method outperformed the latest approaches in 
      terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. The ability to effectively 
      localize small abnormalities and handle over-fitted challenges is highlighted as 
      a key strength of the suggested framework which can assist the practitioners in 
      the timely recognition of such eye ailments.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most popular debilitating impairment of diabetes 
      and it progresses symptom-free until a sudden loss of vision occurs. 
      Understanding the progression of DR is a pressing issue in clinical research and 
      practice. In this systematic review of articles on Machine Learning (ML) based 
      risk prediction models for DR progression, ever since the use of Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) for DR detection, there have been more cross-sectional studies 
      with different algorithms of use of AI, there haven't been many longitudinal 
      studies for the AI based risk prediction models. This paper proposes a novel 
      review to fill in the gaps identified in current reviews and facilitate other 
      researchers with current research solutions for developing AI-based risk 
      prediction models for DR progression and closely related problems; synthesize the 
      current results from these studies and identify research challenges, limitations 
      and gaps to inform the selection of machine learning techniques and predictors to 
      build novel prediction models. Additionally, this paper suggested six (6) deep 
      AI-related technical and critical discussion of the adopted strategies and 
      approaches. The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology was employed to 
      gather relevant studies. We searched IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Springer Link, Google 
      Scholar, and Science Direct electronic databases for papers published from 
      January 2017 to 30th April 2023. Thirteen (13) studies were chosen on the basis 
      of their relevance to the review questions and satisfying the selection criteria. 
      However, findings from the literature review exposed some critical research gaps 
      that need to be addressed in future research to improve on the performance of 
      risk prediction models for DR progression.

TI  - Detecting diabetic retinopathy through machine learning on electronic health 
      record data from an urban, safety net healthcare system.
PG  - ooab066

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical guidelines recommend annual eye examinations to detect 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with diabetes. However, timely DR detection 
      remains a problem in medically underserved and under-resourced settings in the 
      United States. Machine learning that identifies patients with latent/undiagnosed 
      DR could help to address this problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using electronic 
      health record data from 40 631 unique diabetic patients seen at Los Angeles 
      County Department of Health Services healthcare facilities between January 1, 
      2015 and December 31, 2017, we compared ten machine learning environments, 
      including five classifier models, for assessing the presence or absence of DR. We 
      also used data from a distinct set of 9300 diabetic patients seen between January 
      1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 as an external validation set. RESULTS: Following 
      feature subset selection, the classifier with the best AUC on the external 
      validation set was a deep neural network using majority class undersampling, with 
      an AUC of 0.8, the sensitivity of 72.17%, and specificity of 74.2%. DISCUSSION: A 
      deep neural network produced the best AUCs and sensitivity results on the test 
      set and external validation set. Models are intended to be used to screen 
      guideline noncompliant diabetic patients in an urban safety-net setting. 
      CONCLUSION: Machine learning on diabetic patients' routinely collected clinical 
      data could help clinicians in safety-net settings to identify and target 
      unscreened diabetic patients who potentially have undiagnosed DR.

TI  - Deep Learning for Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Fused With 
      Heterogeneous Data From EHRs Can Lead to Earlier Referral Decisions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fundus images are typically used as the sole training input for 
      automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. In this study, we considered 
      several well-known DR risk factors and attempted to improve the accuracy of DR 
      screening. METPHODS: Fusing nonimage data (e.g., age, gender, smoking status, 
      International Classification of Disease code, and laboratory tests) with data 
      from fundus images can enable an end-to-end deep learning architecture for DR 
      screening. We propose a neural network that simultaneously trains heterogeneous 
      data and increases the performance of DR classification in terms of sensitivity 
      and specificity. In the current retrospective study, 13,410 fundus images and 
      their corresponding nonimage data were collected from the Chung Shan Medical 
      University Hospital in Taiwan. The images were classified as either nonreferable 
      or referable for DR by a panel of ophthalmologists. Cross-validation was used for 
      the training models and to evaluate the classification performance. RESULTS: The 
      proposed fusion model achieved 97.96% area under the curve with 96.84% 
      sensitivity and 89.44% specificity for determining referable DR from multimodal 
      data, and significantly outperformed the models that used image or nonimage 
      information separately. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion model with heterogeneous data has 
      the potential to improve referable DR screening performance for earlier referral 
      decisions. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Artificial intelligence fused with 
      heterogeneous data from electronic health records could provide earlier referral 
      decisions from DR screening.

AB  - PURPOSE: Timely diagnosis of eye diseases is paramount to obtaining the best 
      treatment outcomes. OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) have several advantages that 
      lend themselves to early detection of ocular pathology; furthermore, the 
      techniques produce large, feature-rich data volumes. However, the full clinical 
      potential of both OCT and OCTA is stymied when complex data acquired using the 
      techniques must be manually processed. Here, we propose an automated diagnostic 
      framework based on structural OCT and OCTA data volumes that could substantially 
      support the clinical application of these technologies. DESIGN: Cross sectional 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six OCT and OCTA volumes were scanned 
      from the eyes of 91 healthy participants, 161 patients with diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR), 95 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and 108 patients 
      with glaucoma. METHODS: The diagnosis framework was constructed based on 
      semisequential 3-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks. The trained 
      framework classifies combined structural OCT and OCTA scans as normal, DR, AMD, 
      or glaucoma. Fivefold cross-validation was performed, with 60% of the data 
      reserved for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The training, 
      validation, and test data sets were independent, with no shared patients. For 
      scans diagnosed as DR, AMD, or glaucoma, 3D class activation maps were generated 
      to highlight subregions that were considered important by the framework for 
      automated diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under the curve (AUC) of the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve and quadratic-weighted kappa were used to 
      quantify the diagnostic performance of the framework. RESULTS: For the diagnosis 
      of DR, the framework achieved an AUC of 0.95 ± 0.01. For the diagnosis of AMD, 
      the framework achieved an AUC of 0.98 ± 0.01. For the diagnosis of glaucoma, the 
      framework achieved an AUC of 0.91 ± 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning frameworks 
      can provide reliable, sensitive, interpretable, and fully automated diagnosis of 
      eye diseases. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy occurs as a result of the harmful effects of diabetes on the 
      eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is also a disease that should be diagnosed early. If 
      not treated early, vision loss may occur. It is estimated that one third of more 
      than half a million diabetic patients will have diabetic retinopathy by the 22nd 
      century. Many effective methods have been proposed for disease detection with 
      deep learning. In this study, unlike other studies, a deep learning-based method 
      has been proposed in which diabetic retinopathy lesions are detected 
      automatically and independently of datasets, and the detected lesions are 
      classified. In the first stage of the proposed method, a data pool is created by 
      collecting diabetic retinopathy data from different datasets. With Faster RCNN, 
      lesions are detected, and the region of interests are marked. The images obtained 
      in the second stage are classified using the transfer learning and attention 
      mechanism. The method tested in Kaggle and MESSIDOR datasets reached 99.1% and 
      100% ACC and 99.9% and 100% AUC, respectively. When the obtained results are 
      compared with other results in the literature, it is seen that more successful 
      results are obtained.

TI  - DREAM: diabetic retinopathy analysis using machine learning.
PG  - 1717-28
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2013.2294635 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a computer-aided screening system (DREAM) that analyzes 
      fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view, and generates a 
      severity grade for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning. Classifiers 
      such as the Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support 
      vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost are analyzed for classifying retinopathy 
      lesions from nonlesions. GMM and kNN classifiers are found to be the best 
      classifiers for bright and red lesion classification, respectively. A main 
      contribution of this paper is the reduction in the number of features used for 
      lesion classification by feature ranking using Adaboost where 30 top features are 
      selected out of 78. A novel two-step hierarchical classification approach is 
      proposed where the nonlesions or false positives are rejected in the first step. 
      In the second step, the bright lesions are classified as hard exudates and cotton 
      wool spots, and the red lesions are classified as hemorrhages and 
      micro-aneurysms. This lesion classification problem deals with unbalanced 
      datasets and SVM or combination classifiers derived from SVM using the 
      Dempster-Shafer theory are found to incur more classification error than the GMM 
      and kNN classifiers due to the data imbalance. The DR severity grading system is 
      tested on 1200 images from the publicly available MESSIDOR dataset. The DREAM 
      system achieves 100% sensitivity, 53.16% specificity, and 0.904 AUC, compared to 
      the best reported 96% sensitivity, 51% specificity, and 0.875 AUC, for 
      classifying images as with or without DR. The feature reduction further reduces 
      the average computation time for DR severity per image from 59.54 to 3.46 s.

      Public Health Records.
PG  - 983-90
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Annual eye examinations are recommended for diabetic patients in 
      order to detect diabetic retinopathy and other eye conditions that arise from 
      diabetes. Medically underserved urban communities in the US have annual screening 
      rates that are much lower than the national average and could benefit from 
      informatics approaches to identify unscreened patients most at risk of developing 
      retinopathy. METHODS: Using clinical data from urban safety net clinics as well 
      as public health data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey, we examined different machine learning approaches for predicting 
      retinopathy from clinical or public health data. All datasets utilized exhibited 
      a class imbalance. RESULTS: Classifiers learned on the clinical data were 
      modestly predictive of retinopathy with the best model having an AUC of 0.72, 
      sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 55.9%. Classifiers learned on public 
      health data were not predictive of retinopathy. DISCUSSION: Successful approaches 
      to detecting latent retinopathy using machine learning could help safety net and 
      other clinics identify unscreened patients who are most at risk of developing 
      retinopathy and the use of ensemble classifiers on clinical data shows promise 
      for this purpose.

AB  - Purposes: To describe the development and validation of an artificial 
      intelligence-based, deep learning algorithm (DeepDR) for the detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) in retinal fundus photographs. Methods: Five hundred 
      fundus images, which had detailed labelling of DR lesions, were transmitted to be 
      analysed, including localization of the optic disk and macular, vessel 
      segmentation, detection of lesions, and grading of DR. The multi-level iterative 
      method of convolutional neural network and the strategy of enhanced learning were 
      used to improve the accuracy of the system (DeepDR) for grading DR. Three public 
      data sets were used to further train the software. The final grading results were 
      tested based on the fundus images provided by the hospitals. Results: For 6788 
      fundus images (both macular and disc centred) of two Hospital Eye Center, the 
      detection of microaneurysm, haemorrhage and hard exudates had an accuracy of 
      99.7%, 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. The current algorithm accuracy was 0.96. 
      Another 20,000 fundus images from community screening were selected, and 7593 
      photos of poor quality were excluded according to quality standards. Accuracy for 
      accurate staging of fundus photos: accuracy was 0.9179. The sensitivity, 
      specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were 80.58%, 95.77% and 0.9327, 
      respectively. Conclusions: This artificial intelligence-based DeepDR can be used 
      with high accuracy for the detection of DR in retinal images. This technology 
      offers the potential to increase the efficiency and accessibility of DR screening 
      programs.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are forms of 
      degenerative retinal disorders that may result in vision impairment or even 
      permanent blindness. Early detection of these conditions is essential to 
      maintaining a patient's quality of life. The fundus photography technique is 
      non-invasive, safe, and rapid way of assessing the function of the retina. It is 
      widely used as a diagnostic tool for patients who suffer from fundus-related 
      diseases. Using fundus images to analyze these two diseases is a challenging 
      exercise, since there are rarely obvious features in the images during the 
      incipient stages of the disease. In order to deal with these issues, we have 
      proposed a deep learning method called FunSwin. The Swin Transformer constitutes 
      the main framework for this method. Additionally, due to the characteristics of 
      medical images, such as their small number and relatively fixed structure, 
      transfer learning strategy that are able to increase the low-level 
      characteristics of the model as well as data enhancement strategy to balance the 
      data are integrated. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method 
      outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both binary and multiclass 
      classification tasks on the benchmark dataset.

AB  - Purpose: To development and validation of machine learning-based classifiers 
      based on simple non-ocular metrics for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy 
      (RDR) in a large-scale Chinese population-based survey. Methods: The 1,418 
      patients with diabetes mellitus from 8,952 rural residents screened in the 
      population-based Dongguan Eye Study were used for model development and 
      validation. Eight algorithms [extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, 
      naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost, Light GBM, artificial neural 
      network (ANN), and logistic regression] were used for modeling to detect RDR in 
      individuals with diabetes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AUC) and their 95% confidential interval (95% CI) were estimated using 
      five-fold cross-validation as well as an 80:20 ratio of training and validation. 
      Results: The 10 most important features in machine learning models were duration 
      of diabetes, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride, body mass index, serum 
      creatine, age, educational level, duration of hypertension, and income level. 
      Based on these top 10 variables, the XGBoost model achieved the best 
      discriminative performance, with an AUC of 0.816 (95%CI: 0.812, 0.820). The AUCs 
      for logistic regression, AdaBoost, naïve Bayes, and Random forest were 0.766 
      (95%CI: 0.756, 0.776), 0.754 (95%CI: 0.744, 0.764), 0.753 (95%CI: 0.743, 0.763), 
      and 0.705 (95%CI: 0.697, 0.713), respectively. Conclusions: A machine 
      learning-based classifier that used 10 easily obtained non-ocular variables was 
      able to effectively detect RDR patients. The importance scores of the variables 
      provide insight to prevent the occurrence of RDR. Screening RDR with machine 
      learning provides a useful complementary tool for clinical practice in 
      resource-poor areas with limited ophthalmic infrastructure.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Diagnosis and Ranking of Risk Factors for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy in Population-Based Studies from South India.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13122084 [doi]
LID - 2084
AB  - This paper discusses the importance of investigating DR using machine learning 
      and a computational method to rank DR risk factors by importance using different 
      machine learning models. The dataset was collected from four large 
      population-based studies conducted in India between 2001 and 2010 on the 
      prevalence of DR and its risk factors. We deployed different machine learning 
      models on the dataset to rank the importance of the variables (risk factors). The 
      study uses a t-test and Shapely additive explanations (SHAP) to rank the risk 
      factors. Then, it uses five machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision 
      Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes) to identify 
      the unimportant risk factors based on the area under the curve criterion to 
      predict DR. To determine the overall significance of risk variables, a weighted 
      average of each classifier's importance is used. The ranking of risk variables is 
      provided to machine learning models. To construct a model for DR prediction, the 
      combination of risk factors with the highest AUC is chosen. The results show that 
      the risk factors glycosylated hemoglobin and systolic blood pressure were present 
      in the top three risk factors for DR in all five machine learning models when the 
      t-test was used for ranking. Furthermore, the risk factors, namely, systolic 
      blood pressure and history of hypertension, were present in the top five risk 
      factors for DR in all the machine learning models when SHAP was used for ranking. 
      Finally, when an ensemble of the five machine learning models was employed, 
      independently with both the t-test and SHAP, systolic blood pressure and diabetes 
      mellitus duration were present in the top four risk factors for diabetic 
      retinopathy. Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor resulted in the highest AUCs of 
      0.79 (t-test) and 0.77 (SHAP). Moreover, K-Nearest Neighbor predicted DR with 
      82.6% (t-test) and 78.3% (SHAP) accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of preventable blindness, 
      especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Deep-learning 
      systems have the potential to enhance diabetic retinopathy screenings in these 
      settings, yet prospective studies assessing their usability and performance are 
      scarce. METHODS: We did a prospective interventional cohort study to evaluate the 
      real-world performance and feasibility of deploying a deep-learning system into 
      the health-care system of Thailand. Patients with diabetes and listed on the 
      national diabetes registry, aged 18 years or older, able to have their fundus 
      photograph taken for at least one eye, and due for screening as per the Thai 
      Ministry of Public Health guidelines were eligible for inclusion. Eligible 
      patients were screened with the deep-learning system at nine primary care sites 
      under Thailand's national diabetic retinopathy screening programme. Patients with 
      a previous diagnosis of diabetic macular oedema, severe non-proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy; previous laser 
      treatment of the retina or retinal surgery; other non-diabetic retinopathy eye 
      disease requiring referral to an ophthalmologist; or inability to have fundus 
      photograph taken of both eyes for any reason were excluded. Deep-learning 
      system-based interpretations of patient fundus images and referral 
      recommendations were provided in real time. As a safety mechanism, regional 
      retina specialists over-read each image. Performance of the deep-learning system 
      (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and 
      negative predictive value [NPV]) were measured against an adjudicated reference 
      standard, provided by fellowship-trained retina specialists. This study is 
      registered with the Thai national clinical trials registry, TCRT20190902002. 
      FINDINGS: Between Dec 12, 2018, and March 29, 2020, 7940 patients were screened 
      for inclusion. 7651 (96·3%) patients were eligible for study analysis, and 2412 
      (31·5%) patients were referred for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, 
      ungradable images, or low visual acuity. For vision-threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy, the deep-learning system had an accuracy of 94·7% (95% CI 
      93·0-96·2), sensitivity of 91·4% (87·1-95·0), and specificity of 95·4% 
      (94·1-96·7). The retina specialist over-readers had an accuracy of 93·5 
      (91·7-95·0; p=0·17), a sensitivity of 84·8% (79·4-90·0; p=0·024), and specificity 
      of 95·5% (94·1-96·7; p=0·98). The PPV for the deep-learning system was 79·2 (95% 
      CI 73·8-84·3) compared with 75·6 (69·8-81·1) for the over-readers. The NPV for 
      the deep-learning system was 95·5 (92·8-97·9) compared with 92·4 (89·3-95·5) for 
      the over-readers. INTERPRETATION: A deep-learning system can deliver real-time 
      diabetic retinopathy detection capability similar to retina specialists in 
      community-based screening settings. Socioenvironmental factors and workflows must 
      be taken into consideration when implementing a deep-learning system within a 
      large-scale screening programme in LMICs. FUNDING: Google and Rajavithi Hospital,

TI  - Evaluating a Deep Learning Diabetic Retinopathy Grading System Developed on 
      Mydriatic Retinal Images When Applied to Non-Mydriatic Community Screening.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11030614 [doi]
LID - 614
AB  - Artificial Intelligence has showcased clear capabilities to automatically grade 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) on mydriatic retinal images captured by clinical 
      experts on fixed table-top retinal cameras within hospital settings. However, in 
      many low- and middle-income countries, screening for DR revolves around minimally 
      trained field workers using handheld non-mydriatic cameras in community settings. 
      This prospective study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a deep learning 
      algorithm developed using mydriatic retinal images by the Singapore Eye Research 
      Institute, commercially available as Zeiss VISUHEALTH-AI DR, on images captured 
      by field workers on a Zeiss Visuscout(®) 100 non-mydriatic handheld camera from 
      people with diabetes in a house-to-house cross-sectional study across 20 regions 
      in India. A total of 20,489 patient eyes from 11,199 patients were used to 
      evaluate algorithm performance in identifying referable DR, non-referable DR, and 
      gradability. For each category, the algorithm achieved precision values of 29.60 
      (95% CI 27.40, 31.88), 92.56 (92.13, 92.97), and 58.58 (56.97, 60.19), recall 
      values of 62.69 (59.17, 66.12), 85.65 (85.11, 86.18), and 65.06 (63.40, 66.69), 
      and F-score values of 40.22 (38.25, 42.21), 88.97 (88.62, 89.31), and 61.65 
      (60.50, 62.80), respectively. Model performance reached 91.22 (90.79, 91.64) 
      sensitivity and 65.06 (63.40, 66.69) specificity at detecting gradability and 
      72.08 (70.68, 73.46) sensitivity and 85.65 (85.11, 86.18) specificity for the 
      detection of all referable eyes. Algorithm accuracy is dependent on the quality 
      of acquired retinal images, and this is a major limiting step for its global 
      implementation in community non-mydriatic DR screening using handheld cameras. 
      This study highlights the need to develop and train deep learning-based screening 
      tools in such conditions before implementation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To create and validate code-free automated deep learning models (AutoML) 
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification from handheld retinal images. 
      DESIGN: Prospective development and validation of AutoML models for DR image 
      classification. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17 829 deidentified retinal images from 
      3566 eyes with diabetes, acquired using handheld retinal cameras in a 
      community-based DR screening program. METHODS: AutoML models were generated based 
      on previously acquired 5-field (macula-centered, disc-centered, superior, 
      inferior, and temporal macula) handheld retinal images. Each individual image was 
      labeled using the International DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) 
      Classification Scale by 4 certified graders at a centralized reading center under 
      oversight by a senior retina specialist. Images for model development were split 
      8-1-1 for training, optimization, and testing to detect referable DR ([refDR], 
      defined as moderate nonproliferative DR or worse or any level of DME). Internal 
      validation was performed using a published image set from the same patient 
      population (N = 450 images from 225 eyes). External validation was performed 
      using a publicly available retinal imaging data set from the Asia Pacific 
      Tele-Ophthalmology Society (N = 3662 images). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under 
      the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive 
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and F1 scores. 
      RESULTS: Referable DR was present in 17.3%, 39.1%, and 48.0% of the training set, 
      internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. The model's 
      AUPRC was 0.995 with a precision and recall of 97% using a score threshold of 
      0.5. Internal validation showed that SN, SP, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 scores 
      were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.884-0.99), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.937-0.995), 
      0.96 (95% CI, 0.884-0.99), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.937-0.995), 0.97, and 0.96, 
      respectively. External validation showed that SN, SP, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 
      scores were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.929-0.951), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.957-0.974), 0.96 (95% CI, 
      0.952-0.971), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.935-0.956), 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the accuracy and feasibility of code-free 
      AutoML models for identifying refDR developed using handheld retinal imaging in a 
      community-based screening program. Potentially, the use of AutoML may increase 
      access to machine learning models that may be adapted for specific programs that 
      are guided by the clinical need to rapidly address disparities in health care 
      delivery. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be

TI  - Automated Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using Deep Learning.
PG  - 147-155
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. 
      Early detection of this condition is critical for good prognosis. In this paper, 
      we demonstrate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on color fundus 
      images for the recognition task of diabetic retinopathy staging. Our network 
      models achieved test metric performance comparable to baseline literature 
      results, with validation sensitivity of 95%. We additionally explored multinomial 
      classification models, and demonstrate that errors primarily occur in the 
      misclassification of mild disease as normal due to the CNNs inability to detect 
      subtle disease features. We discovered that preprocessing with contrast limited 
      adaptive histogram equalization and ensuring dataset fidelity by expert 
      verification of class labels improves recognition of subtle features. Transfer 
      learning on pretrained GoogLeNet and AlexNet models from ImageNet improved peak 
      test set accuracies to 74.5%, 68.8%, and 57.2% on 2-ary, 3-ary, and 4-ary 
      classification models, respectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: Real-world evaluation of a deep learning model that prioritizes patients 
      based on risk of progression to moderate or worse (MOD+) diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). METHODS: This nonrandomized, single-arm, prospective, interventional study 
      included patients attending DR screening at four centers across Thailand from 
      September 2019 to January 2020, with mild or no DR. Fundus photographs were input 
      into the model, and patients were scheduled for their subsequent screening from 
      September 2020 to January 2021 in order of predicted risk. Evaluation focused on 
      model sensitivity, defined as correctly ranking patients that developed MOD+ 
      within the first 50% of subsequent screens. RESULTS: We analyzed 1,757 patients, 
      of which 52 (3.0%) developed MOD+. Using the model-proposed order, the model's 
      sensitivity was 90.4%. Both the model-proposed order and mild/no DR plus HbA1c 
      had significantly higher sensitivity than the random order (P < 0.001). Excluding 
      one major (rural) site that had practical implementation challenges, the 
      remaining sites included 567 patients and 15 (2.6%) developed MOD+. Here, the 
      model-proposed order achieved 86.7% versus 73.3% for the ranking that used DR 
      grade and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: The model can help prioritize follow-up 
      visits for the largest subgroups of DR patients (those with no or mild DR). 
      Further research is needed to evaluate the impact on clinical management and 
      outcomes. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Deep learning demonstrated potential for risk 
      stratification in DR screening. However, real-world practicalities must be 
      resolved to fully realize the benefit.

LID - 10.1007/s00417-021-05503-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate a deep learning system for diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) grading based on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) images. METHODS: A 
      total of 11,214 FFA images from 705 patients were collected to form the internal 
      dataset. Three convolutional neural networks, namely VGG16, RestNet50, and 
      DenseNet, were trained using a nine-square grid input, and heat maps were 
      generated. Subsequently, a comparison between human graders and the algorithm was 
      performed. Lastly, the best model was tested on two external datasets (Xian 
      dataset and Ningbo dataset). RESULTS: VGG16 performed the best, with a maximum 
      accuracy of 94.17%, and had an AUC of 0.972, 0.922, and 0.994 for levels 1, 2, 
      and 3, respectively. For Xian dataset, our model reached the accuracy of 82.47% 
      and AUC of 0.910, 0.888, and 0.976 for levels 1, 2, and 3. As for Ningbo dataset, 
      the network performed with the accuracy of 88.89% and AUC of 0.972, 0.756, and 
      0.945 for levels 1, 2, and 3. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning system for DR staging 
      was trained based on FFA images and evaluated through human-machine comparisons 
      as well as external dataset testing. The proposed system will help clinical 
      practitioners to diagnose and treat DR patients, and lay a foundation for future 
      applications of other ophthalmic or general diseases.

AB  - In this review, a selection of works on the sensing of biomarkers related to 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are presented, with the 
      scope of helping and encouraging researchers to design sensor-array 
      machine-learning (ML)-supported devices for robust, fast, and cost-effective 
      early detection of these devastating diseases. First, we highlight the social 
      relevance of developing systematic screening programs for such diseases and how 
      sensor-arrays and ML approaches could ease their early diagnosis. Then, we 
      present diverse works related to the colorimetric and electrochemical sensing of 
      biomarkers related to DM and DR with non-invasive sampling (e.g., urine, saliva, 
      breath, tears, and sweat samples), with a special mention to some 
      already-existing sensor arrays and ML approaches. We finally highlight the great 
      potential of the latter approaches for the fast and reliable early diagnosis of 
      DM and DR.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study aims to classify the eyes with proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy (PDR) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) vascular density maps using a 
      supervised machine learning algorithm. METHODS: OCTA vascular density maps (at 
      superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and total retina 
      (R) levels) of 148 eyes from 78 patients with diabetic retinopathy (45 PDR and 
      103 NPDR) was used to classify the images to NPDR and PDR groups based on a 
      supervised machine learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) 
      classifier optimized by a genetic evolutionary algorithm. RESULTS: The 
      implemented algorithm in three different models reached up to 85% accuracy in 
      classifying PDR and NPDR in all three levels of vascular density maps. The deep 
      retinal layer vascular density map demonstrated the best performance with a 90% 
      accuracy in discriminating between PDR and NPDR. CONCLUSIONS: The current study 
      on a limited number of patients with diabetic retinopathy demonstrated that a 
      supervised machine learning-based method known as SVM can be used to 
      differentiate PDR and NPDR patients using OCTA vascular density maps.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the emerging applications of deep learning in 
      ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that various deep 
      learning models are capable of detecting and diagnosing various diseases 
      afflicting the posterior segment of the eye with high accuracy. Most of the 
      initial studies have centered around detection of referable diabetic retinopathy, 
      age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. SUMMARY: Deep learning has shown 
      promising results in automated image analysis of fundus photographs and optical 
      coherence tomography images. Additional testing and research is required to 
      clinically validate this technology.

AB  - In today's world, diabetic retinopathy is a very severe health issue, which is 
      affecting many humans of different age groups. Due to the high levels of blood 
      sugar, the minuscule blood vessels in the retina may get damaged in no time and 
      further may lead to retinal detachment and even sometimes lead to glaucoma 
      blindness. If diabetic retinopathy can be diagnosed at the early stages, then 
      many of the affected people will not be losing their vision and also human lives 
      can be saved. Several machine learning and deep learning methods have been 
      applied on the available data sets of diabetic retinopathy, but they were unable 
      to provide the better results in terms of accuracy in preprocessing and 
      optimizing the classification and feature extraction process. To overcome the 
      issues like feature extraction and optimization in the existing systems, we have 
      considered the Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set from the UCI machine 
      learning repository and designed a deep learning model with principal component 
      analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and to extract the most important 
      features, Harris hawks optimization algorithm is used further to optimize the 
      classification and feature extraction process. The results shown by the deep 
      learning model with respect to specificity, precision, accuracy, and recall are 
      very much satisfactory compared to the existing systems.

AB  - The lifestyle of modern society has changed significantly with the emergence of 
      artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) 
      technologies in recent years. Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional 
      technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. 
      Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to 
      ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in 
      the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to 
      validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic 
      mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of 
      irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to 
      diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies 
      including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods 
      of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital 
      photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the 
      most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed 
      world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average 
      lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, 
      DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the 
      limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a 
      major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population 
      growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time-consuming, 
      costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, 
      AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated 
      applications system in the near future will be inevitable. We provide an overview 
      of the potential impact of the current AI, ML, and DL methods and their 
      applications on the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other 
      ophthalmic diseases.

AB  - TOPIC: Diagnostic performance of deep learning-based algorithms in screening 
      patients with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy (DR). The algorithms were 
      compared with the current gold standard of classification by human specialists. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because DR is a common cause of visual impairment, screening 
      is indicated to avoid irreversible vision loss. Automated DR classification using 
      deep learning may be a suitable new screening tool that could improve diagnostic 
      performance and reduce manpower. METHODS: For this systematic review, we aimed to 
      identify studies that incorporated the use of deep learning in classifying 
      full-scale DR in retinal fundus images of patients with diabetes. The studies had 
      to provide a DR grading scale, a human grader as a reference standard, and a deep 
      learning performance score. A systematic search on April 5, 2018, through MEDLINE 
      and Embase yielded 304 publications. To identify potentially missed publications, 
      the reference lists of the final included studies were manually screened, 
      yielding no additional publications. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
      Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used for risk of bias and applicability assessment. 
      RESULTS: By using objective selection, we included 11 diagnostic accuracy studies 
      that validated the performance of their deep learning method using a new group of 
      patients or retrospective datasets. Eight studies reported sensitivity and 
      specificity of 80.28% to 100.0% and 84.0% to 99.0%, respectively. Two studies 
      report accuracies of 78.7% and 81.0%. One study provides an area under the 
      receiver operating curve of 0.955. In addition to diagnostic performance, one 
      study also reported on patient satisfaction, showing that 78% of patients 
      preferred an automated deep learning model over manual human grading. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Advantages of implementing deep learning-based algorithms in DR 
      screening include reduction in manpower, cost of screening, and issues relating 
      to intragrader and intergrader variability. However, limitations that may hinder 
      such an implementation particularly revolve around ethical concerns regarding 
      lack of trust in the diagnostic accuracy of computers. Considering both strengths 
      and limitations, as well as the high performance of deep learning-based 
      algorithms, automated DR classification using deep learning could be feasible in 
      a real-world screening scenario.

      using both traditional statistical methods and interpretable machine learning: a 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the extent to which diabetic retinopathy severity 
      stage may be classified using machine learning (ML) and commonly used clinical 
      measures of visual function together with age and sex. METHODS: We measured the 
      visual function of 1901 eyes from 1032 participants in the Northern Ireland 
      Sensory Ageing Study, deriving 12 variables from nine visual function tests. 
      Missing values were imputed using chained equations. Participants were divided 
      into four groups using clinical measures and grading of ophthalmic images: no 
      diabetes mellitus (no DM), diabetes but no diabetic retinopathy (DM no DR), 
      diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular oedema (DR no DMO) and diabetic 
      retinopathy with DMO (DR with DMO). Ensemble ML models were fitted to classify 
      group membership for three tasks, distinguishing (A) the DM no DR group from the 
      no DM group; (B) the DR no DMO group from the DM no DR group; and (C) the DR with 
      DMO group from the DR no DMO group. More conventional multiple logistic 
      regression models were also fitted for comparison. An interpretable ML technique 
      was used to rank the contribution of visual function variables to predictions and 
      to disentangle associations between diabetic eye disease and visual function from 
      artefacts of the data collection process. RESULTS: The performance of the 
      ensemble ML models was good across all three classification tasks, with 
      accuracies of 0.92, 1.00 and 0.84, respectively, for tasks A-C, substantially 
      exceeding the accuracies for logistic regression (0.84, 0.61 and 0.80, 
      respectively). Reading index was highly ranked for tasks A and B, whereas near 
      visual acuity and Moorfields chart acuity were important for task C. 
      Microperimetry variables ranked highly for all three tasks, but this was partly 
      due to a data artefact (a large proportion of missing values). 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Ensemble ML models predicted status of diabetic eye 
      disease with high accuracy using just age, sex and measures of visual function. 
      Interpretable ML methods enabled us to identify profiles of visual function 
      associated with different stages of diabetic eye disease, and to disentangle 
      associations from artefacts of the data collection process. Together, these two 
      techniques have great potential for developing prediction models using untidy 
      real-world clinical data.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in the 
      detection of referral-warranted diabetic retinopathy (RDR) on low-resolution 
      fundus images acquired with a smartphone and indirect ophthalmoscope lens 
      adapter. METHODS: An automated deep learning algorithm trained on 92,364 
      traditional fundus camera images was tested on a dataset of smartphone fundus 
      images from 103 eyes acquired from two previously published studies. Images were 
      extracted from live video screenshots from fundus examinations using a 
      commercially available lens adapter and exported as a screenshot from live video 
      clips filmed at 1080p resolution. Each image was graded twice by a 
      board-certified ophthalmologist and compared to the output of the algorithm, 
      which classified each image as having RDR (moderate nonproliferative DR or worse) 
      or no RDR. RESULTS: In spite of the presence of multiple artifacts (lens glare, 
      lens particulates/smudging, user hands over the objective lens) and 
      low-resolution images achieved by users of various levels of medical training, 
      the algorithm achieved a 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.95) area under 
      the curve with an 89% sensitivity (95% CI 81%-100%) and 83% specificity (95% CI 
      77%-89%) for detecting RDR on mobile phone acquired fundus photos. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The fully data-driven artificial intelligence-based grading algorithm herein can 
      be used to screen fundus photos taken from mobile devices and identify with high 
      reliability which cases should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further 
      evaluation and treatment. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The implementation of this 
      algorithm on a global basis could drastically reduce the rate of vision loss 
      attributed to DR.

TI  - A Machine Learning Ensemble Classifier for Early Prediction of Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.
PG  - 201

AB  - The main complication of diabetes is Diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vascular 
      disease and it leads to the blindness. Regular screening for early DR disease 
      detection is considered as an intensive labor and resource oriented task. 
      Therefore, automatic detection of DR diseases is performed only by using the 
      computational technique is the great solution. An automatic method is more 
      reliable to determine the presence of an abnormality in Fundus images (FI) but, 
      the classification process is poorly performed. Recently, few research works have 
      been designed for analyzing texture discrimination capacity in FI to distinguish 
      the healthy images. However, the feature extraction (FE) process was not 
      performed well, due to the high dimensionality. Therefore, to identify retinal 
      features for DR disease diagnosis and early detection using Machine Learning and 
      Ensemble Classification method, called, Machine Learning Bagging Ensemble 
      Classifier (ML-BEC) is designed. The ML-BEC method comprises of two stages. The 
      first stage in ML-BEC method comprises extraction of the candidate objects from 
      Retinal Images (RI). The candidate objects or the features for DR disease 
      diagnosis include blood vessels, optic nerve, neural tissue, neuroretinal rim, 
      optic disc size, thickness and variance. These features are initially extracted 
      by applying Machine Learning technique called, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor 
      Embedding (t-SNE). Besides, t-SNE generates a probability distribution across 
      high-dimensional images where the images are separated into similar and 
      dissimilar pairs. Then, t-SNE describes a similar probability distribution across 
      the points in the low-dimensional map. This lessens the Kullback-Leibler 
      divergence among two distributions regarding the locations of the points on the 
      map. The second stage comprises of application of ensemble classifiers to the 
      extracted features for providing accurate analysis of digital FI using machine 
      learning. In this stage, an automatic detection of DR screening system using 
      Bagging Ensemble Classifier (BEC) is investigated. With the help of voting the 
      process in ML-BEC, bagging minimizes the error due to variance of the base 
      classifier. With the publicly available retinal image databases, our classifier 
      is trained with 25% of RI. Results show that the ensemble classifier can achieve 
      better classification accuracy (CA) than single classification models. Empirical 
      experiments suggest that the machine learning-based ensemble classifier is 
      efficient for further reducing DR classification time (CT).

AB  - PURPOSE: To comprehensively analyze and discuss the publications on machine 
      learning (ML) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) following a bibliometric approach. 
      METHODS: The global publications on ML in DR from 2011 to 2021 were retrieved 
      from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. We analyzed the 
      publication and citation trend over time and identified highly-cited articles, 
      prolific countries, institutions, journals and the most relevant research 
      domains. VOSviewer and Wordcloud are used to visualize the mainstream research 
      topics and evolution of subtopics in the form of co-occurrence maps of keywords. 
      RESULTS: By analyzing a total of 1147 relevant publications, this study found a 
      rapid increase in the number of annual publications, with an average growth rate 
      of 42.68%. India and China were the most productive countries. IEEE Access was 
      the most productive journal in this field. In addition, some notable common 
      points were found in the highly-cited articles. The keywords analysis showed that 
      "diabetic retinopathy", "classification", and "fundus images" were the most 
      frequent keywords for the entire period, as automatic diagnosis of DR was always 
      the mainstream topic in the relevant field. The evolution of keywords highlighted 
      some breakthroughs, including "deep learning" and "optical coherence tomography", 
      indicating the advance in technologies and changes in the research attention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As new research topics have emerged and evolved, studies are 
      becoming increasingly diverse and extensive. Multiple modalities of medical data, 
      new ML techniques and constantly optimized algorithms are the future trends in 
      this multidisciplinary field.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the common chronic complications of diabetes 
      and the most common blinding eye disease. If not treated in time, it might lead 
      to visual impairment and even blindness in severe cases. Therefore, this article 
      proposes an algorithm for detecting diabetic retinopathy based on deep ensemble 
      learning and attention mechanism. First, image samples were preprocessed and 
      enhanced to obtain high quality image data. Second, in order to improve the 
      adaptability and accuracy of the detection algorithm, we constructed a holistic 
      detection model DR-IIXRN, which consists of Inception V3, InceptionResNet V2, 
      Xception, ResNeXt101, and NASNetLarge. For each base classifier, we modified the 
      network model using transfer learning, fine-tuning, and attention mechanisms to 
      improve its ability to detect DR. Finally, a weighted voting algorithm was used 
      to determine which category (normal, mild, moderate, severe, or proliferative DR) 
      the images belonged to. We also tuned the trained network model on the hospital 
      data, and the real test samples in the hospital also confirmed the advantages of 
      the algorithm in the detection of the diabetic retina. Experiments show that 
      compared with the traditional single network model detection algorithm, the auc, 
      accuracy, and recall rate of the proposed method are improved to 95, 92, and 92%, 
      respectively, which proves the adaptability and correctness of the proposed 
      method.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) stays as an eye issue that has continuously developed 
      in individuals who experienced diabetes. The complexities in diabetes cause harm 
      to the vein at the back of the retina. In outrageous cases, DR could swift 
      apparition disaster or visual impairment. This genuine impact had the option to 
      charge through convenient treatment and early recognition. As of late, this issue 
      has been spreading quickly, particularly in the working region, which in the end 
      constrained the interest of an analysis of this disease from the most prompt 
      stage. Therefore, that are castoff to protect the progressions of this disorder, 
      revealing of the retinal blood vessels (RBVs) play a foremost role. The growth of 
      an abnormal vessel leads to the development steps of DR, where it can be well 
      known by extracting the RBV. The recognition of the BV for DR by developing an 
      automatic approach is a major aim of our research study. In the proposed method, 
      there are two major steps: one is segmentation and the second one is 
      classification of affected retinal BV. The proposed method uses the Kinetic Gas 
      Molecule Optimization based on centroid initialization used for the Fuzzy C-means 
      Clustering. In the classification step, those segmented images are given as input 
      to hybrid techniques such as a convolution neural network with bidirectional-long 
      short-term memory (CNN with Bi-LSTM). The learning degree of Bi-LSTM is revised 
      by using the self-attention mechanism for refining the classification accuracy. 
      The trial consequences disclosed that the mixture algorithm achieved higher 
      accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity than existing techniques.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop deep learning-based networks for the diagnosis of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) with cataracts based on infrared fundus images. SETTING: 
      Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention & Treatment Center, 
      Shanghai, China. DESIGN: Development and evaluation of an artificial intelligence 
      (AI) diagnostic method. METHODS: A total of 10 665 infrared fundus images from 
      4553 patients with diabetes were used to train and test the model. For image 
      quality assessment, left and right eye classification, DR diagnosis and grading, 
      and segmentation of 3 DR lesions, an end-to-end software using EfficientNet and 
      UNet was developed. The accuracy and performance of the software in comparison to 
      human experts was evaluated. RESULTS: The model achieved an accuracy of 75.31% 
      for left and right eye classification, 100% for DR grading and diagnosis tasks, 
      and 73.67% for internal test set, with corresponding areas under the curve (AUCs) 
      of 0.88, 1.00, and 0.89, respectively. For DR lesion segmentation, the AUCs of 
      hemorrhagic, microangioma, and exudative lesions were 0.86, 0.66, and 0.84, 
      respectively. In addition, a contrast test of human-machine film reading 
      confirmed the software's high sensitivity (96.3%) and specificity (90.0%) and 
      consistency with the manual film reading group (κ = 0.869, P < .001). This easily 
      deployable software generated reports quickly and promoted efficient DR screening 
      with cataracts in clinical and community settings. CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted 
      software can perform automatic analysis of infrared fundus images and has 
      substantial application value for the diagnosis of DR patients with cataracts.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a predominant cause of visual impairment and loss. 
      Approximately 285 million worldwide population is affected with diabetes, and 
      one-third of these patients have symptoms of DR. Specifically, it tends to affect 
      the patients with 20 years or more with diabetes, but it can be reduced by early 
      detection and proper treatment. Diagnosis of DR by using manual methods is a 
      time-consuming and expensive task which involves trained ophthalmologists to 
      observe and evaluate DR using digital fundus images of the retina. This study 
      aims to systematically find and analyze high-quality research work for the 
      diagnosis of DR using deep learning approaches. This research comprehends the DR 
      grading, staging protocols and also presents the DR taxonomy. Furthermore, 
      identifies, compares, and investigates the deep learning-based algorithms, 
      techniques, and, methods for classifying DR stages. Various publicly available 
      dataset used for deep learning have also been analyzed and dispensed for 
      descriptive and empirical understanding for real-time DR applications. Our 
      in-depth study shows that in the last few years there has been an increasing 
      inclination towards deep learning approaches. 35% of the studies have used 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 26% implemented the Ensemble CNN (ECNN) 
      and, 13% Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are amongst the most used algorithms for the 
      DR classification. Thus using the deep learning algorithms for DR diagnostics 
      have future research potential for DR early detection and prevention based 
      solution.

AB  - PURPOSE: To improve disease severity classification from fundus images using a 
      hybrid architecture with symptom awareness for diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      METHODS: We used 26,699 fundus images of 17,834 diabetic patients from three 
      Taiwanese hospitals collected in 2007 to 2018 for DR severity classification. 
      Thirty-seven ophthalmologists verified the images using lesion annotation and 
      severity classification as the ground truth. Two deep learning fusion 
      architectures were proposed: late fusion, which combines lesion and severity 
      classification models in parallel using a postprocessing procedure, and two-stage 
      early fusion, which combines lesion detection and classification models 
      sequentially and mimics the decision-making process of ophthalmologists. 
      Messidor-2 was used with 1748 images to evaluate and benchmark the performance of 
      the architecture. The primary evaluation metrics were classification accuracy, 
      weighted κ statistic, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC). RESULTS: For hospital data, a hybrid architecture achieved a good 
      detection rate, with accuracy and weighted κ of 84.29% and 84.01%, respectively, 
      for five-class DR grading. It also classified the images of early stage DR more 
      accurately than conventional algorithms. The Messidor-2 model achieved an AUC of 
      97.09% in referral DR detection compared to AUC of 85% to 99% for 
      state-of-the-art algorithms that learned from a larger database. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      hybrid architectures strengthened and extracted characteristics from DR images, 
      while improving the performance of DR grading, thereby increasing the robustness 
      and confidence of the architectures for general use. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The 
      proposed fusion architectures can enable faster and more accurate diagnosis of 
      various DR pathologies than that obtained in current manual clinical practice.

AB  - The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical 
      models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) 
      using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust 
      performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the 
      automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved 
      capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language 
      processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been 
      demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, 
      pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective 
      clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
      retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular 
      risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also 
      increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease 
      features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as 
      neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in 
      detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate 
      clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and 
      no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the 
      development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease 
      burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which 
      AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL 
      system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption 
      are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical 
      ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up 
      of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations 
      globally.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of acquired 
      vision loss in adults across the globe. Early identification and treatment of 
      patients with DR is paramount for vision preservation. The aim of this review 
      paper is to outline current and new imaging techniques and biomarkers that are 
      valuable for clinical diagnosis and management of DR. RECENT FINDINGS: Ultrawide 
      field imaging and automated deep learning algorithms are recent advancements on 
      traditional fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography are techniques that image retinal anatomy 
      and vasculature and OCT is routinely used to monitor response to treatment. Many 
      circulating, vitreous, and genetic biomarkers have been studied to facilitate 
      disease detection and development of new treatments. Recent advancements in 
      retinal imaging and identification of promising new biomarkers for DR have the 
      potential to increase detection, risk stratification, and treatment for patients 
      with DR.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical performance of an automated diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) screening model to detect referable cases at Siriraj Hospital, 
      Bangkok, Thailand. METHODS: A retrospective review of two sets of fundus 
      photographs (Eidon and Nidek) was undertaken. The images were classified by DR 
      staging prior to the development of a DR screening model. In a prospective 
      cross-sectional enrollment of patients with diabetes, automated detection of 
      referable DR was compared with the results of the gold standard, a dilated fundus 
      examination. RESULTS: The study analyzed 2533 Nidek fundus images and 1989 Eidon 
      images. The sensitivities calculated for the Nidek and Eidon images were 0.93 and 
      0.88 and the specificities were 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. In a clinical 
      verification phase using 982 Nidek and 674 Eidon photographs, the calculated 
      sensitivities and specificities were 0.86 and 0.92 for Nidek along with 0.92 and 
      0.84 for Eidon, respectively. The 60°-field images from the Eidon yielded a more 
      desirable performance in differentiating referable DR than did the corresponding 
      images from the Nidek. CONCLUSIONS: A conventional fundus examination requires 
      intense healthcare resources. It is time consuming and possibly leads to 
      unavoidable human errors. The deep learning algorithm for the detection of 
      referable DR exhibited a favorable performance and is a promising alternative for 
      DR screening. However, variations in the color and pixels of photographs can 
      cause differences in sensitivity and specificity. The image angle and poor 
      quality of fundus photographs were the main limitations of the automated method. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The deep learning algorithm, developed from basic 
      research of image processing, was applied to detect referable DR in a real-word 
      clinical care setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ophthalmology field was among the first to adopt artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in medicine. The availability of digitized ocular images and 
      substantial data have made deep learning (DL) a popular topic. MAIN TEXT: At the 
      moment, AI in ophthalmology is mostly used to improve disease diagnosis and 
      assist decision-making aiming at ophthalmic diseases like diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract and other 
      anterior segment diseases. However, most of the AI systems developed to date are 
      still in the experimental stages, with only a few having achieved clinical 
      applications. There are a number of reasons for this phenomenon, including 
      security, privacy, poor pervasiveness, trust and explainability concerns. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes AI applications in ophthalmology, 
      highlighting significant clinical considerations for adopting AI techniques and 
      discussing the potential challenges and future directions.

TI  - Non-invasive technique to detect diabetic retinopathy based on Electrooculography 
      signal using machine learning classifiers.
PG  - 882-895
LID - 10.1177/09544119221085422 [doi]
AB  - Single-channel Electrooculogram (EOG) is proposed for detecting diabetic 
      retinopathy. The Corneal-retinal potential of the eyes plays a vital role in the 
      acquisition of Electrooculography. Diabetes is the most prevalent disease and for 
      one out of three people with diabetes above 40 years, diabetic retinopathy 
      occurs. It is necessary for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy as it is 
      one of the primary reasons for blindness in the population. The potential 
      difference between cornea and retina leads to the acquisition of EOG signal. The 
      proposed study aims to design a low-cost miniaturized hardware circuit to obtain 
      EOG signal using second order filters without compromising in accuracy of the 
      outcome signal and to classify the signal into normal and diabetic retinopathy 
      subjects by extracting the statistical features like kurtosis, mean, median 
      absolute deviation, standard deviation, and range from software filtered EOG 
      signal. Among the classifiers used, Support vector machine (SVM) shows a higher 
      accuracy of 93.33%. The sensitivity, specificity and Area Under Curve (AUC) 
      values of SVM are 96.43%, 90.625%, 0.93% is considered as more favorable outcome 
      for the proposed method and it supports the developed prototype and processing 
      methodology. The novelty of the research is based on proposing and exploring a

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness 
      globally. Earlier detection and timely treatment of DR are desirable to reduce 
      the incidence and progression of vision loss. Currently, deep learning (DL) 
      approaches have offered better performance in detecting DR from retinal fundus 
      images. We, therefore, performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of 
      relevant studies to quantify the performance of DL algorithms for detecting DR. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature search on EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus 
      was performed between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2019. The search strategy 
      was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, and DL-based study design was 
      mandatory for articles inclusion. Two independent authors screened abstracts and 
      titles against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two 
      authors independently using a standard form and the Quality Assessment of 
      Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used for the risk of bias and 
      applicability assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the 
      systematic review; 20 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The 
      pooled area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC) of DR was 0.97 (95%CI: 
      0.95-0.98), sensitivity was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.83-0.83), and specificity was 0.92 
      (95%CI: 0.92-0.92). The positive- and negative-likelihood ratio were 14.11 
      (95%CI: 9.91-20.07), and 0.10 (95%CI: 0.07-0.16), respectively. Moreover, the 
      diagnostic odds ratio for DL models was 136.83 (95%CI: 79.03-236.93). All the 
      studies provided a DR-grading scale, a human grader (e.g. trained caregivers, 
      ophthalmologists) as a reference standard. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study 
      showed that DL algorithms had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting 
      referable DR from retinal fundus photographs. Applying a DL-based automated tool 
      of assessing DR from color fundus images could provide an alternative solution to 
      reduce misdiagnosis and improve workflow. A DL-based automated tool offers 
      substantial benefits to reduce screening costs, accessibility to healthcare and 
      ameliorate earlier treatments.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in the world. In the 
      past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have been used to 
      detect and grade DR. Early detection enables appropriate treatment and thus 
      prevents vision loss. For this purpose, both fundus and optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) images are used to image the retina. Next, Deep-learning 
      (DL)-/machine-learning (ML)-based approaches make it possible to extract features 
      from the images and to detect the presence of DR, grade its severity and segment 
      associated lesions. This review covers the literature dealing with AI approaches 
      to DR such as ML and DL in classification and segmentation that have been 
      published in the open literature within six years (2016-2021). In addition, a 
      comprehensive list of available DR datasets is reported. This list was 
      constructed using both the PICO (P-Patient, I-Intervention, C-Control, O-Outcome) 
      and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 
      2009 search strategies. We summarize a total of 114 published articles which 
      conformed to the scope of the review. In addition, a list of 43 major datasets is 
      presented.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is the main cause of diabetic retinopathy, the most common 
      cause of blindness worldwide. In order to slow down or prevent vision loss and 
      degeneration, early detection and treatment are essential. For the purpose of 
      detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy on fundus retina images, numerous 
      artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been put forth by the scientific 
      community. Due to its real-time relevance to everyone's lives, smart healthcare 
      is attracting a lot of interest. With the convergence of IoT, this attention has 
      increased. The leading cause of blindness among persons in their working years is 
      diabetic eye disease. Millions of people live in the most populous Asian nations, 
      including China and India, and the number of diabetics among them is on the rise. 
      To provide medical screening and diagnosis for this rising population of diabetes 
      patients, skilled clinicians faced significant challenges. Our objective is to 
      use deep learning techniques to automatically detect blind spots in eyes and 
      determine how serious they may be. We suggest an enhanced convolutional neural 
      network (ECNN) utilizing a genetic algorithm in this paper. The ECNN technique's 
      accuracy results are compared to those of existing approaches like the K-nearest 
      neighbor approach, convolutional neural network, and support vector machine with 
      the genetic algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: As an extension of optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical 
      coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) provides information on the blood flow 
      status at the microlevel and is sensitive to changes in the fundus vessels. 
      However, due to the distinct imaging mechanism of OCTA, existing models, which 
      are primarily used for analyzing fundus images, do not work well on OCTA images. 
      Effectively extracting and analyzing the information in OCTA images remains 
      challenging. To this end, a deep learning framework that fuses multilevel 
      information in OCTA images is proposed in this study. The effectiveness of the 
      proposed model was demonstrated in the task of diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      classification. METHOD: First, a U-Net-based segmentation model was proposed to 
      label the boundaries of large retinal vessels and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) 
      in OCTA images. Then, we designed an isolated concatenated block (ICB) structure 
      to extract and fuse information from the original OCTA images and segmentation 
      results at different fusion levels. RESULTS: The experiments were conducted on 
      301 OCTA images. Of these images, 244 were labeled by ophthalmologists as normal 
      images, and 57 were labeled as DR images. An accuracy of 93.1% and a mean 
      intersection over union (mIOU) of 77.1% were achieved using the proposed large 
      vessel and FAZ segmentation model. In the ablation experiment with 6-fold 
      validation, the proposed deep learning framework that combines the proposed 
      isolated and concatenated convolution process significantly improved the DR 
      diagnosis accuracy. Moreover, inputting the merged images of the original OCTA 
      images and segmentation results further improved the model performance. Finally, 
      a DR diagnosis accuracy of 88.1% (95%CI ± 3.6%) and an area under the curve (AUC) 
      of 0.92 were achieved using our proposed classification model, which 
      significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art classification models. As a 
      comparison, an accuracy of 83.7 (95%CI ± 1.5%) and AUC of 0.76 were obtained 
      using EfficientNet. Significance. The visualization results show that the FAZ and 
      the vascular region close to the FAZ provide more information for the model than 
      the farther surrounding area. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that a 
      clinically sophisticated designed deep learning model is not only able to 
      effectively assist in the diagnosis but also help to locate new indicators for 
      certain illnesses.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a disease which affect the vision ability. The 
      observation by an ophthalmologist usually conducted by analyzing the retinal 
      images of the patient which are marked by some DR features. However some 
      misdiagnosis are usually found due to human error. Here, a deep learning-based 
      low-cost embedded system is established to assist the doctor for grading the 
      severity of the DR from the retinal images. A compact deep learning algorithm 
      named Deep-DR-Net which fits on a small embedded board is afterwards proposed for 
      such purposes. In the heart of Deep-DR-Net, a cascaded encoder-classifier network 
      is arranged using residual style for ensuring the small model size. The usage of 
      different types of convolutional layers subsequently guarantees the features 
      richness of the network for differentiating the grade of the DR. Experimental 
      results show the capability of the proposed system for detecting the existence as 
      well as grading the severity of the DR symptomps.

AB  - The demand for AI to improve patients outcome has been increased; we, therefore, 
      aim to establish the diagnostic values of AI in diabetic retinopathy by pooling 
      the published studies of deep learning on this subject. A total of eight studies 
      included which evaluated deep learning in a total of 706,922 retinal images. The 
      overall pooled area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) was 98.93% 
      (95%CI:98.37%-99.49%). However, the overall pooled sensitivity and specificity 
      for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) was 74% (95% CI: 73%-74%), and 
      95% (95% CI: 95%-95%). The findings of this study show that deep learning had 
      high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy.

PG  - 1859-1863
LID - 10.1136/bjo-2022-321063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Retinal capillary non-perfusion (NP) and neovascularisation (NV) 
      are two of the most important angiographic changes in diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      This study investigated the feasibility of using deep learning (DL) models to 
      automatically segment NP and NV on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) 
      images from patients with DR. METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional chart review 
      study. In total, 951 UWFA images were collected from patients with severe 
      non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or proliferative DR (PDR). Each image was segmented 
      and labelled for NP, NV, disc, background and outside areas. Using the labelled 
      images, DL models were trained and validated (80%) using convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs) for automated segmentation and tested (20%) on test sets. 
      Accuracy of each model and each label were assessed. RESULTS: The best accuracy 
      from CNN models for each label was 0.8208, 0.8338, 0.9801, 0.9253 and 0.9766 for 
      NP, NV, disc, background and outside areas, respectively. The best Intersection 
      over Union for each label was 0.6806, 0.5675, 0.7107, 0.8551 and 0.924 and mean 
      mean boundary F1 score (BF score) was 0.6702, 0.8742, 0.9092, 0.8103 and 0.9006, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DL models can detect NV and NP as well as disc and 
      outer margins on UWFA with good performance. This automated segmentation of 
      important UWFA features will aid physicians in DR clinics and in overcoming 
      grader subjectivity.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in glaucoma.
PG  - 1868-1869
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_1015_22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that 
      encompasses the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. 
      It deals with the development algorithms that seek to simulate human brain and 
      also mimic cognitive functions typically associated with the human mind such as 
      learning and problem solving. PURPOSE: Do we need artificial intelligence in 
      Glaucoma? Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the world. Its 
      prevalence was over 60 million in 2010 and over 80 million by 2020. It is so 
      common, yet so easily overlooked. More importantly, about 50% of patients in 
      developed countries and 90% in developing countries are unaware of having 
      glaucoma. Early detection can delay the progression of glaucoma. Hence the time 
      is ripe to advovate glaucoma screening. SYNOPSIS: The application of AI in 
      ophthalmology mainly concentrates on the diseases with a high incidence, such as 
      diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of 
      prematurity, age-related or congenital cataract etc AI involves mainly 1. machine 
      learning that are algorithms with the ability to learn without being explicitly 
      programmed and 2. deep learning in which artificial neural networks adapt and 
      learn from vast amounts of data. But there are limitations to screening - such as 
      disparity between ophthalmologist:patient ratio and also the availability of the 
      specialty services. The large amount of data acquired from patients makes it 
      nearly impossible for ophthalmologists to screen them with equal efficacy and 
      consistency. HIGHLIGHTS: AI in glaucoma aims at including factors such as 
      clinical data, genomic data, life style behaviors, risk factors, and medical 
      history to predict the risk of developing glaucoma, help customise the most 
      appropriate management protocol for a given patient, and estimate prognosis and 
      surgical success. VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/IwYS7wDMhkY.

TI  - A New Deep Learning Algorithm with Activation Mapping for Diabetic Retinopathy: 
      Backtesting after 10 Years of Tele-Ophthalmology.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11174945 [doi]
LID - 4945
AB  - We report the development of a deep learning algorithm (AI) to detect signs of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images. For this, we use a ResNet-50 neural 
      network with a double resolution, the addition of Squeeze-Excitation blocks, 
      pre-trained in ImageNet, and trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer. The 
      AI-based algorithm not only classifies an image as pathological or not but also 
      detects and highlights those signs that allow DR to be identified. For 
      development, we have used a database of about half a million images classified in 
      a real clinical environment by family doctors (FDs), ophthalmologists, or both. 
      The AI was able to detect more than 95% of cases worse than mild DR and had 70% 
      fewer misclassifications of healthy cases than FDs. In addition, the AI was able 
      to detect DR signs in 1258 patients before they were detected by FDs, 
      representing 7.9% of the total number of DR patients detected by the FDs. These 
      results suggest that AI is at least comparable to the evaluation of FDs. We 
      suggest that it may be useful to use signaling tools such as an aid to diagnosis 
      rather than an AI as a stand-alone tool.

TI  - RDS-DR: An Improved Deep Learning Model for Classifying Severity Levels of 
      Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13193116 [doi]
LID - 3116
AB  - A well-known eye disorder called diabetic retinopathy (DR) is linked to elevated 
      blood glucose levels. Cotton wool spots, confined veins in the cranial nerve, AV 
      nicking, and hemorrhages in the optic disc are some of its symptoms, which often 
      appear later. Serious side effects of DR might include vision loss, damage to the 
      visual nerves, and obstruction of the retinal arteries. Researchers have devised 
      an automated method utilizing AI and deep learning models to enable the early 
      diagnosis of this illness. This research gathered digital fundus images from 
      renowned Pakistani eye hospitals to generate a new "DR-Insight" dataset and known 
      online sources. A novel methodology named the residual-dense system (RDS-DR) was 
      then devised to assess diabetic retinopathy. To develop this model, we have 
      integrated residual and dense blocks, along with a transition layer, into a deep 
      neural network. The RDS-DR system is trained on the collected dataset of 9860 
      fundus images. The RDS-DR categorization method demonstrated an impressive 
      accuracy of 97.5% on this dataset. These findings show that the model produces 
      beneficial outcomes and may be used by healthcare practitioners as a diagnostic 
      tool. It is important to emphasize that the system's goal is to augment 
      optometrists' expertise rather than replace it. In terms of accuracy, the RDS-DR 
      technique fared better than the cutting-edge models VGG19, VGG16, Inception V-3, 
      and Xception. This emphasizes how successful the suggested method is for 
      classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR).

TI  - A deep learning nomogram of continuous glucose monitoring data for the risk 
      prediction of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data analysis will provide a new perspective 
      to analyze factors related to diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the problem of 
      visualizing CGM data and automatically predicting the incidence of DR from CGM is 
      still controversial. Here, we explored the feasibility of using CGM profiles to 
      predict DR in type 2 diabetes (T2D) by deep learning approach. This study fused 
      deep learning with a regularized nomogram to construct a novel deep learning 
      nomogram from CGM profiles to identify patients at high risk of DR. Specifically, 
      a deep learning network was employed to mine the nonlinear relationship between 
      CGM profiles and DR. Moreover, a novel nomogram combining CGM deep factors with 
      basic information was established to score the patients' DR risk. This dataset 
      consists of 788 patients belonging to two cohorts: 494 in the training cohort and 
      294 in the testing cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) values of our deep 
      learning nomogram were 0.82 and 0.80 in the training cohort and testing cohort, 
      respectively. By incorporating basic clinical factors, the deep learning nomogram 
      achieved an AUC of 0.86 in the training cohort and 0.85 in the testing cohort. 
      The calibration plot and decision curve showed that the deep learning nomogram 
      had the potential for clinical application. This analysis method of CGM profiles 
      can be extended to other diabetic complications by further investigation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To understand the impact of deep learning diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      algorithms on physician readers in computer-assisted settings. DESIGN: Evaluation 
      of diagnostic technology. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred ninety-six 
      retinal fundus images from 1612 diabetic patients. METHODS: Ten ophthalmologists 
      (5 general ophthalmologists, 4 retina specialists, 1 retina fellow) read images 
      for DR severity based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy disease 
      severity scale in each of 3 conditions: unassisted, grades only, or grades plus 
      heatmap. Grades-only assistance comprised a histogram of DR predictions (grades) 
      from a trained deep-learning model. For grades plus heatmap, we additionally 
      showed explanatory heatmaps. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each experiment arm, we 
      computed sensitivity and specificity of each reader and the algorithm for 
      different levels of DR severity against an adjudicated reference standard. We 
      also measured accuracy (exact 5-class level agreement and Cohen's quadratically 
      weighted κ), reader-reported confidence (5-point Likert scale), and grading time. 
      RESULTS: Readers graded more accurately with model assistance than without for 
      the grades-only condition (P < 0.001). Grades plus heatmaps improved accuracy for 
      patients with DR (P < 0.001), but reduced accuracy for patients without DR (P = 
      0.006). Both forms of assistance increased readers' sensitivity moderate-or-worse 
      DR: unassisted: mean, 79.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 72.3%-86.5%]; grades 
      only: mean, 87.5% [95% CI, 85.1%-89.9%]; grades plus heatmap: mean, 88.7% [95% 
      CI, 84.9%-92.5%] without a corresponding drop in specificity (unassisted: mean, 
      96.6% [95% CI, 95.9%-97.4%]; grades only: mean, 96.1% [95% CI, 95.5%-96.7%]; 
      grades plus heatmap: mean, 95.5% [95% CI, 94.8%-96.1%]). Algorithmic assistance 
      increased the accuracy of retina specialists above that of the unassisted reader 
      or model alone; and increased grading confidence and grading time across all 
      readers. For most cases, grades plus heatmap was only as effective as grades 
      only. Over the course of the experiment, grading time decreased across all 
      conditions, although most sharply for grades plus heatmap. CONCLUSIONS: Deep 
      learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of, and confidence in, DR diagnosis 
      in an assisted read setting. They also may increase grading time, although these 
      effects may be ameliorated with experience.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a visual obstacle caused by diabetic disease, which 
      forms because of long-standing diabetes mellitus, which damages the retinal blood 
      vessels. This disease is considered one of the principal causes of sightlessness 
      and accounts for more than 158 million cases all over the world. Since early 
      detection and classification could diminish the visual impairment, it is 
      significant to develop an automated DR diagnosis method. Although deep learning 
      models provide automatic feature extraction and classification, training such 
      models from scratch requires a larger annotated dataset. The availability of 
      annotated training datasets is considered a core issue for implementing deep 
      learning in the classification of medical images. The models based on transfer 
      learning are widely adopted by the researchers to overcome annotated data 
      insufficiency problems and computational overhead. In the proposed study, 
      features are extracted from fundus images using the pre-trained network VGGNet 
      and combined with the concept of transfer learning to improve classification 
      performance. To deal with data insufficiency and unbalancing problems, we 
      employed various data augmentation operations differently on each grade of DR. 
      The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed framework (which is 
      evaluated on the benchmark dataset) outperformed advanced methods in terms of 
      accurateness. Our technique, in combination with handcrafted features, could be 
      used to improve classification accuracy.

AB  - Deep learning is an emerging technology with numerous potential applications in 
      Ophthalmology. Deep learning tools have been applied to different diagnostic 
      modalities including digital photographs, optical coherence tomography, and 
      visual fields. These tools have demonstrated utility in assessment of various 
      disease processes including cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular 
      degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Deep learning techniques are evolving 
      rapidly, and will become more integrated into ophthalmic care. This article 
      reviews the current evidence for deep learning in ophthalmology, and discusses 
      future applications, as well as potential drawbacks.

TI  - Low-Shot Deep Learning of Diabetic Retinopathy With Potential Applications to 
      Address Artificial Intelligence Bias in Retinal Diagnostics and Rare Ophthalmic 
      Diseases.
PG  - 1070-1077
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.3269 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Recent studies have demonstrated the successful application of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) for automated retinal disease diagnostics but have 
      not addressed a fundamental challenge for deep learning systems: the current need 
      for large, criterion standard-annotated retinal data sets for training. Low-shot 
      learning algorithms, aiming to learn from a relatively low number of training 
      data, may be beneficial for clinical situations involving rare retinal diseases 
      or when addressing potential bias resulting from data that may not adequately 
      represent certain groups for training, such as individuals older than 85 years. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether low-shot deep learning methods are beneficial when 
      using small training data sets for automated retinal diagnostics. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study, conducted from July 1, 
      2019, to June 21, 2020, compared different diabetic retinopathy classification 
      algorithms, traditional and low-shot, for 2-class designations (diabetic 
      retinopathy warranting referral vs not warranting referral). The public domain 
      EyePACS data set was used, which originally included 88 692 fundi from 44 346 
      individuals. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to June 21, 2020. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The performance (95% CIs) of the various AI 
      algorithms was measured via receiver operating curves and their area under the 
      curve (AUC), precision recall curves, accuracy, and F1 score, evaluated for 
      different training data sizes, ranging from 5120 to 10 samples per class. 
      RESULTS: Deep learning algorithms, when trained with sufficiently large data sets 
      (5120 samples per class), yielded comparable performance, with an AUC of 0.8330 
      (95% CI, 0.8140-0.8520) for a traditional approach (eg, fined-tuned ResNet), 
      compared with low-shot methods (AUC, 0.8348 [95% CI, 0.8159-0.8537]) (using 
      self-supervised Deep InfoMax [our method denoted as DIM]). However, when far 
      fewer training images were available (n = 160), the traditional deep learning 
      approach had an AUC decreasing to 0.6585 (95% CI, 0.6332-0.6838) and was 
      outperformed by a low-shot method using self-supervision with an AUC of 0.7467 
      (95% CI, 0.7239-0.7695). At very low shots (n = 10), the traditional approach had 
      performance close to chance, with an AUC of 0.5178 (95% CI, 0.4909-0.5447) 
      compared with the best low-shot method (AUC, 0.5778 [95% CI, 0.5512-0.6044]). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest the potential benefits of using 
      low-shot methods for AI retinal diagnostics when a limited number of annotated 
      training retinal images are available (eg, with rare ophthalmic diseases or when 
      addressing potential AI bias).

AB  - Deep learning methods for diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis are usually 
      criticized as being lack of interpretability in the diagnostic result, thus 
      limiting their application in clinic. Simultaneous prediction of DR related 
      features during the DR severity diagnosis is able to resolve this issue by 
      providing supporting evidence (i.e. DR related features) for the diagnostic 
      result (i.e. DR severity). In this study, we propose a hierarchical multi-task 
      deep learning framework for simultaneous diagnosis of DR severity and DR related 
      features in fundus images. A hierarchical structure is introduced to incorporate 
      the casual relationship between DR related features and DR severity levels. In 
      the experiments, the proposed approach was evaluated on two independent testing 
      sets using quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient, receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, and precision-recall analysis. A grader study was also 
      conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach with those of 
      general ophthalmologists with different levels of experience. The results 
      demonstrate that the proposed approach could improve the performance for both DR 
      severity diagnosis and DR related feature detection when comparing with the 
      traditional deep learning-based methods. It achieves performance close to general 
      ophthalmologists with five years of experience when diagnosing DR severity 
      levels, and general ophthalmologists with ten years of experience for referable 
      DR detection.

TI  - Supervised Contrastive Learning with Angular Margin for the Detection and Grading 
      of Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13142389 [doi]
LID - 2389
AB  - Many researchers have realized the intelligent medical diagnosis of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) from fundus images by using deep learning methods, including 
      supervised contrastive learning (SupCon). However, although SupCon brings label 
      information into the calculation of contrastive learning, it does not distinguish 
      between augmented positives and same-label positives. As a result, we propose the 
      concept of Angular Margin and incorporate it into SupCon to address this issue. 
      To demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, we tested it on two datasets 
      for the detection and grading of DR. To align with previous work, Accuracy, 
      Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC were selected as evaluation metrics. Moreover, we 
      also chose alignment and uniformity to verify the effect of representation 
      learning and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to visualize 
      fundus image embeddings. In summary, DR detection achieved state-of-the-art 
      results across all metrics, with Accuracy = 98.91, Precision = 98.93, Recall = 
      98.90, F1 = 98.91, and AUC = 99.80. The grading also attained state-of-the-art 
      results in terms of Accuracy and AUC, which were 85.61 and 93.97, respectively. 
      The experimental results demonstrate that Angular Margin is an excellent 
      intelligent medical diagnostic algorithm, performing well in both DR detection 
      and grading tasks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our research was to prospectively explore the clinical 
      value of a deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect referable diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) in different subgroups stratified by types of diabetes, blood pressure, sex, 
      BMI, age, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diabetes duration, urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) at a real-world diabetes center in China. METHODS: A total of 1147 
      diabetic patients from Shanghai General Hospital were recruited from October 2018 
      to August 2019. Retinal fundus images were graded by the DLA, and the detection 
      of referable DR (moderate nonproliferative DR or worse) was compared with a 
      reference standard generated by one certified retinal specialist with more than 
      12 years of experience. The performance of DLA across different subgroups 
      stratified by types of diabetes, blood pressure, sex, BMI, age, HbA1c, diabetes 
      duration, UACR, and eGFR was evaluated. RESULTS: For all 1674 gradable images, 
      the area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, and specificity of the 
      DLA for referable DR were 0.942 (95% CI, 0.920-0.964), 85.1% (95% CI, 
      83.4%-86.8%), and 95.6% (95% CI, 94.6%-96.6%), respectively. The DLA showed 
      consistent performance across most subgroups, while it showed superior 
      performance in the subgroups of patients with type 1 diabetes, UACR ≥ 30 mg/g, 
      and eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73m(2) . CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the DLA was a 
      reliable alternative method for the detection of referable DR and performed 
      superior in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy who were prone 
      to DR.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of 
      science that empowers machines using human intelligence. AI refers to the 
      technology of rendering human intelligence through computer programs. From 
      healthcare to the precise prevention, diagnosis, and management of diseases, AI 
      is progressing rapidly in various interdisciplinary fields, including 
      ophthalmology. Ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medicine because the 
      diagnosis of ocular diseases heavy reliance on imaging. Recently, deep 
      learning-based AI screening and prediction models have been applied to the most 
      common visual impairment and blindness diseases, including glaucoma, cataract, 
      age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The 
      success of AI in medicine is primarily attributed to the development of deep 
      learning algorithms, which are computational models composed of multiple layers 
      of simulated neurons. These models can learn the representations of data at 
      multiple levels of abstraction. The Inception-v3 algorithm and transfer learning 
      concept have been applied in DR and ARMD to reuse fundus image features learned 
      from natural images (non-medical images) to train an AI system with a fraction of 
      the commonly used training data (<1%). The trained AI system achieved performance 
      comparable to that of human experts in classifying ARMD and diabetic macular 
      edema on optical coherence tomography images. In this study, we highlight the 
      fundamental concepts of AI and its application in these four major ocular 
      diseases and further discuss the current challenges, as well as the prospects in 
      ophthalmology.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we focus on artificial intelligence (AI) 
      algorithms for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening and risk stratification and 
      factors to consider when implementing AI algorithms in the clinic. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: AI algorithms have been adopted, and have received regulatory approval, 
      for automated detection of referable DR with clinically acceptable diagnostic 
      performance. While these metrics are an important first step, performance metrics 
      that go beyond measures of technical accuracy are needed to fully evaluate the 
      impact of AI algorithm on patient outcomes. Recent advances in AI present an 
      exciting opportunity to improve patient care. Using DR as an example, we have 
      reviewed factors to consider in the implementation of AI algorithms in real-world 
      clinical practice. These include real-world evaluation of safety, efficacy, and 
      equity (bias); impact on patient outcomes; ethical, logistical, and regulatory 
      factors.

      Retinopathy.
PG  - 559-563
AB  - This paper mainly focuses on the deep learning application in classifying the 
      stage of diabetic retinopathy and detecting the laterality of the eye using 
      funduscopic images. Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic, progressive, 
      sight-threatening disease of the retinal blood vessels. Ophthalmologists diagnose 
      diabetic retinopathy through early funduscopic screening. Normally, there is a 
      time delay in reporting and intervention, apart from the financial cost and risk 
      of blindness associated with it. Using a convolutional neural network based 
      approach for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, we trained the 
      prediction network on the publicly available Kaggle dataset. Approximately 35,000 
      images were used to train the network, which observed a sensitivity of 80.28% and 
      a specificity of 92.29% on the validation dataset of ~53,000 images. Using 8,810 
      images, the network was trained for detecting the laterality of the eye and 
      observed an accuracy of 93.28% on the validation set of 8,816 images.

TI  - Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy from Ultra-Widefield Scanning Laser 
      Ophthalmoscope Images: A Multicenter Deep Learning Analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning (DL) system that can detect referable 
      diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) 
      from images obtained on ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscope (UWF-SLO). 
      DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9392 
      UWF-SLO images of 1903 eyes from 1022 subjects with diabetes from Hong Kong, the 
      United Kingdom, India, and Argentina. METHODS: All images were labeled according 
      to the presence or absence of RDR and the presence or absence of VTDR. Labeling 
      was performed by retina specialists from fundus examination, according to the 
      International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. Three 
      convolutional neural networks (ResNet50) were trained with a transfer-learning 
      procedure for assessing gradability and identifying VTDR and RDR. External 
      validation was performed on 4 datasets spanning different geographical regions. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC); area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC); sensitivity, specificity, 
      and accuracy of the DL system in gradability assessment; and detection of RDR and 
      VTDR. RESULTS: For gradability assessment, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.923 
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.892-0.947), sensitivity of 86.5% (95% CI, 
      77.6-92.8), and specificity of 82.1% (95% CI, 77.3-86.2) for the primary 
      validation dataset, and >0.82 AUROCs, >79.6% sensitivity, and >70.4% specificity 
      for the geographical external validation datasets. For detecting RDR and VTDR, 
      the AUROCs were 0.981 (95% CI, 0.977-0.984) and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.961-0.971), with 
      sensitivities of 94.9% (95% CI, 92.3-97.9) and 87.2% (95% CI, 81.5-91.6), 
      specificities of 95.1% (95% CI, 90.6-97.9) and 95.8% (95% CI, 93.3-97.6), and 
      positive predictive values (PPVs) of 98.0% (95% CI, 96.1-99.0) and 91.1% (95% CI, 
      86.3-94.3) for the primary validation dataset, respectively. The AUROCs and 
      accuracies for detecting both RDR and VTDR were >0.9% and >80%, respectively, for 
      the geographical external validation datasets. The AUPRCs were >0.9, and 
      sensitivities, specificities, and PPVs were >80% for the geographical external 
      validation datasets for RDR and VTDR detection. CONCLUSIONS: The excellent 
      performance achieved with this DL system for image quality assessment and 
      detection of RDR and VTDR in UWF-SLO images highlights its potential as an 
      efficient and effective diabetic retinopathy screening tool.

AB  - This study is aimed at evaluating a deep transfer learning-based model for 
      identifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) that was trained using a dataset with high 
      variability and predominant type 2 diabetes (T2D) and comparing model performance 
      with that in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The Kaggle dataset, which is a 
      publicly available dataset, was divided into training and testing Kaggle 
      datasets. In the comparison dataset, we collected retinal fundus images of T1D 
      patients at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan from 2013 to 2020, and the 
      images were divided into training and testing T1D datasets. The model was 
      developed using 4 different convolutional neural networks (Inception-V3, 
      DenseNet-121, VGG1, and Xception). The model performance in predicting DR was 
      evaluated using testing images from each dataset, and area under the curve (AUC), 
      sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. The model trained using the Kaggle 
      dataset had an average (range) AUC of 0.74 (0.03) and 0.87 (0.01) in the testing 
      Kaggle and T1D datasets, respectively. The model trained using the T1D dataset 
      had an AUC of 0.88 (0.03), which decreased to 0.57 (0.02) in the testing Kaggle 
      dataset. Heatmaps showed that the model focused on retinal hemorrhage, vessels, 
      and exudation to predict DR. In wrong prediction images, artifacts and low-image 
      quality affected model performance. The model developed with the high variability 
      and T2D predominant dataset could be applied to T1D patients. Dataset homogeneity 
      could affect the performance, trainability, and generalization of the model.

      from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We aimed to evaluate the 
      performance of deep learning neural networks in DME detection. METHODS: Embase, 
      Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore were searched up to August 14, 
      2021. We included studies using deep learning algorithms to detect DME from OCT 
      images. Two reviewers extracted the data independently, and the Quality 
      Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was applied to assess 
      the risk of bias. The study is reported according to Preferred Reporting Items 
      for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies 
      (PRISMA-DTA). RESULTS: Ninteen studies involving 41005 subjects were included. 
      The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 
      93.9% to 97.3%) and 99.3% (95% CI: 98.2% to 99.7%), respectively. Subgroup 
      analyses found that data set selection, sample size of training set and the 
      choice of OCT devices contributed to the heterogeneity (all P < 0.05). While 
      there was no association between the diagnostic accuracy and transfer learning 
      adoption or image management (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning methods, 
      particularly the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could effectively detect 
      clinically significant DME, which can provide referral suggestions to the 
      patients.

TI  - Automated Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning: On the Search of 
      Segmented Retinal Blood Vessel Images for Better Performance.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10040413 [doi]
LID - 413
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most significant retinal diseases that can 
      lead to blindness. As a result, it is critical to receive a prompt diagnosis of 
      the disease. Manual screening can result in misdiagnosis due to human error and 
      limited human capability. In such cases, using a deep learning-based automated 
      diagnosis of the disease could aid in early detection and treatment. In deep 
      learning-based analysis, the original and segmented blood vessels are typically 
      used for diagnosis. However, it is still unclear which approach is superior. In 
      this study, a comparison of two deep learning approaches (Inception v3 and 
      DenseNet-121) was performed on two different datasets of colored images and 
      segmented images. The study's findings revealed that the accuracy for original 
      images on both Inception v3 and DenseNet-121 equaled 0.8 or higher, whereas the 
      segmented retinal blood vessels under both approaches provided an accuracy of 
      just greater than 0.6, demonstrating that the segmented vessels do not add much 
      utility to the deep learning-based analysis. The study's findings show that the 
      original-colored images are more significant in diagnosing retinopathy than the 
      extracted retinal blood vessels.

TI  - Hybrid adaptive deep learning classifier for early detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy using optimal feature extraction and classification.
PG  - 881-895

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness. 
      It is important to use a comprehensive learning method to identify the DR. 
      However, comprehensive learning methods often rely heavily on encrypted data, 
      which can be costly and time consuming. Also, the DR function is not displayed 
      and is scattered in the high-definition image below. METHODS: Therefore, learning 
      how to distribute such DR functions is a big challenge. In this work, we proposed 
      a hybrid adaptive deep learning classifier for early detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy (HADL-DR). First, we provide an improved multichannel-based 
      generative adversarial network (MGAN) with semi-maintenance to detect blood 
      vessels segmentation. RESULTS: By reducing the reliance on the encoded data, the 
      following high-resolution images can be used to detect the indivisible features 
      of some semi-observed MGAN references. Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) 
      function is then extracted and the best function is selected using the improved 
      sequential approximation optimization (SAO) algorithm. After that, a hybrid 
      recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) is utilized for 
      DR classification. The proposed RNN-LSTM classifier evaluated through standard 
      benchmark Kaggle and Messidor datasets. CONCLUSION: Finally, the simulation 
      results are compared with the existing state-of-art classifiers in terms of 
      accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure and area under cover (AUC), it is seen 
      that more successful results are obtained.

TI  - Enhancing deep learning pre-trained networks on diabetic retinopathy fundus 
      photographs with SLIC-G.
LID - 10.1007/s11517-024-03093-0 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy disease contains lesions (e.g., exudates, hemorrhages, and 
      microaneurysms) that are minute to the naked eye. Determining the lesions at 
      pixel level poses a challenge as each pixel does not reflect any semantic 
      entities. Furthermore, the computational cost of inspecting each pixel is 
      expensive because the number of pixels is high even at low resolution. In this 
      work, we propose a hybrid image processing method. Simple Linear Iterative 
      Clustering with Gaussian Filter (SLIC-G) for the purpose of overcoming pixel 
      constraints. The SLIC-G image processing method is divided into two stages: (1) 
      simple linear iterative clustering superpixel segmentation and (2) Gaussian 
      smoothing operation. In such a way, a large number of new transformed datasets 
      are generated and then used for model training. Finally, two performance 
      evaluation metrics that are suitable for imbalanced diabetic retinopathy datasets 
      were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SLIC-G. The results 
      indicate that, in comparison to prior published works' results, the proposed 
      SLIC-G shows better performance on image classification of class imbalanced 
      diabetic retinopathy datasets. This research reveals the importance of image 
      processing and how it influences the performance of deep learning networks. The 
      proposed SLIC-G enhances pre-trained network performance by eliminating the local 
      redundancy of an image, which preserves local structures, but avoids 
      over-segmented, noisy clips. It closes the research gap by introducing the use of 
      superpixel segmentation and Gaussian smoothing operation as image processing 
      methods in diabetic retinopathy-related tasks.

TI  - Development and validation of medical record-based logistic regression and 
      machine learning models to diagnose diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 681-689

AB  - PURPOSES: Many factors were reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR); however, their contributions remained unclear. We aimed to evaluate the 
      prognostic and diagnostic accuracy of logistic regression and three machine 
      learning models based on various medical records. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study. We investigated the prevalence and associations of DR 
      among 757 participants aged 40 years or older in the 2005-2006 National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We trained the models to predict if 
      the participants had DR with 15 predictor variables. Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (AUROC) and mean squared error (MSE) of each algorithm 
      were compared in the external validation dataset using a replicate cohort from 
      NHANES 2007-2008. RESULTS: Among the 757 participants, 53 (7.00%) subjects had 
      DR, the mean (standard deviation, SD) age was 57.7 (13.04), and 78.0% were male 
      (n = 42). Logistic regression revealed that female gender (OR = 4.130, 95% 
      CI: 1.820-9.380; P < 0.05), HbA1c (OR = 1.665, 95% CI: 1.197-2.317; P < 0.05), 
      serum creatine level (OR = 2.952, 95% CI: 1.274-6.851; P < 0.05), and eGFR level 
      (OR = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.000-1.014, P < 0.05) increased the risk of DR. The average 
      performance obtained from internal validation was similar in all models 
      (AUROC ≥ 0.945), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) had the highest value with an 
      AUROC of 0.984. In external validation, they remained robust or with modest 
      reductions in discrimination with AUROC still ≥ 0.902, and KNN also performed the 
      best with an AUROC of 0.982. Both logistic regression and machine learning models 
      had good performance in the clinical diagnosis of DR. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      highlights the utility of comparing traditional logistic regression to machine 
      learning models. We found that logistic regression performed as well as optimized 
      machine learning methods when classifying DR patients.

TI  - Testing a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in a 
      Spanish Diabetic Population and with MESSIDOR Database.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11081385 [doi]
LID - 1385
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to test our deep learning algorithm 
      (DLA) by reading the retinographies. METHODS: We tested our DLA built on 
      convolutional neural networks in 14,186 retinographies from our population and 
      1200 images extracted from MESSIDOR. The retinal images were graded both by the 
      DLA and independently by four retina specialists. Results of the DLA were 
      compared according to accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive 
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), distinguishing between 
      identification of any type of DR (any DR) and referable DR (RDR). RESULTS: The 
      results of testing the DLA for identifying any DR in our population were: ACC = 
      99.75, S = 97.92, SP = 99.91, PPV = 98.92, NPV = 99.82, and AUC = 0.983. When 
      detecting RDR, the results were: ACC = 99.66, S = 96.7, SP = 99.92, PPV = 99.07, 
      NPV = 99.71, and AUC = 0.988. The results of testing the DLA for identifying any 
      DR with MESSIDOR were: ACC = 94.79, S = 97.32, SP = 94.57, PPV = 60.93, NPV = 
      99.75, and AUC = 0.959. When detecting RDR, the results were: ACC = 98.78, S = 
      94.64, SP = 99.14, PPV = 90.54, NPV = 99.53, and AUC = 0.968. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      DLA performed well, both in detecting any DR and in classifying those eyes with 
      RDR in a sample of retinographies of type 2 DM patients in our population and the 
      MESSIDOR database.

AB  - Automating screening and diagnosis in the medical field saves time and reduces 
      the chances of misdiagnosis while saving on labor and cost for physicians. With 
      the feasibility and development of deep learning methods, machines are now able 
      to interpret complex features in medical data, which leads to rapid advancements 
      in automation. Such efforts have been made in ophthalmology to analyze retinal 
      images and build frameworks based on analysis for the identification of 
      retinopathy and the assessment of its severity. This paper reviews recent 
      state-of-the-art works utilizing the color fundus image taken from one of the 
      imaging modalities used in ophthalmology. Specifically, the deep learning methods 
      of automated screening and diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are investigated. In addition, the 
      machine learning techniques applied to the retinal vasculature extraction from 
      the fundus image are covered. The challenges in developing these systems are also 
      discussed.

PG  - 1966-1969
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175664 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition due to diabetes mellitus that 
      can damage the patient retina and cause blood leaks. This condition can cause 
      different symptoms from mild vision problems to complete blindness if it is not 
      timely treated. In this work, we propose the use of a deep learning architecture 
      based on a recent convolutional neural network called EfficientNet to detect 
      referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and vision-threatening DR. Tests were 
      conducted on two public datasets, EyePACS and APTOS 2019. The obtained results 
      achieve state-of-the-art performance and show that the proposed network leads to 
      higher classification rates, achieving an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.984 for RDR 
      and 0.990 for vision-threatening DR on EyePACS dataset. Similar performances are 
      obtained for APTOS 2019 dataset with an AUC of 0.966 and 0.998 for referable and 
      vision-threatening DR, respectively. An explainability algorithm was also 
      developed and shows the efficiency of the proposed approach in detecting DR 
      signs.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175884 [doi]
AB  - The characteristics of diabetic retinopathy (DR) fundus images generally consist 
      of multiple types of lesions which provided strong evidence for the 
      ophthalmologists to make diagnosis. It is particularly significant to figure out 
      an efficient method to not only accurately classify DR fundus images but also 
      recognize all kinds of lesions on them. In this paper, a deep learning-based 
      multi-label classification model with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping 
      (Grad-CAM) was proposed, which can both make DR classification and automatically 
      locate the regions of different lesions. To reducing laborious annotation work 
      and improve the efficiency of labeling, this paper innovatively considered 
      different types of lesions as different labels for a fundus image so that this 
      paper changed the task of lesion detection into that of image classification. A 
      total of five labels were pre-defined and 3228 fundus images were collected for 
      developing our model. The architecture of deep learning model was designed by 
      ourselves based on ResNet. Through experiments on the test images, this method 
      acquired a sensitive of 93.9% and a specificity of 94.4% on DR classification. 
      Moreover, the corresponding regions of lesions were reasonably outlined on the DR 
      fundus images.

TI  - Capacity building in screening and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in 
      Asia-Pacific region.
PG  - 2959-2967
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_1075_21 [doi]
AB  - The focus of capacity building for screening and treatment of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) is on health professionals who are nonophthalmologists. Both 
      physicians and nonphysicians are recruited for screening DR. Although there is no 
      standardization of the course syllabus for the capacity building, it is generally 
      accepted to keep their sensitivity >80%, specificity >95%, and clinical failure 
      rate <5% for the nonophthalmologists, if possible. A systematic literature search 
      was performed using the PubMed database and the following search terms: diabetic 
      retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy screening, Asia, diabetic retinopathy 
      treatment, age-related macular degeneration, capacity building, deep learning, 
      artificial intelligence (AI), nurse-led clinic, and intravitreal injection (IVI). 
      AI may be a tool for improving their capacity. Capacity building on IVIs of 
      antivascular endothelial growth factors for DR is focused on nurses. There is 
      evidence that, after a supervision of an average of 100 initial injections, the 
      trained nurses can do the injections effectively and safely, the rate of 
      endophthalmitis ranges from 0.03 to 0.07%, comparable to ophthalmologists. 
      However, laws and regulations, which are different among countries, are 
      challenges and barriers for nonophthalmologists, particularly for nonphysicians, 
      for both screening and treatment of DR. Even if nonphysicians or physicians who 
      are nonophthalmologists are legally approved for these tasks, sustainability of 
      the capacity is another important challenge, this may be achieved if the capacity 
      building can be part of their career development. Patient acceptability is 
      another important barrier for initiating care provided by nonophthalmologists, 
      particularly in Asia. There are also collaborations between national eye 
      institutes of high-income countries, nongovernment organizations, and local eye 
      institutes to improve both the quality and quantity of ophthalmologists and 
      retinal specialists in low-income countries in Asia. This approach may require 
      more labor, cost, and time consuming than training nonophthalmologists.

      image features. METHODS: A literature search was performed up to August 31st, 
      2021 using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The inclusion 
      criteria were as follows: (1) deep learning, (2) ultra-widefield imaging. The 
      exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) articles published in any language other 
      than English, (2) articles not peer-reviewed (usually preprints), (3) no 
      full-text availability, (4) articles using machine learning algorithms other than 
      deep learning. No study design was excluded from consideration. RESULTS: A total 
      of 36 studies were included. Twenty-three studies discussed ophthalmic disease 
      detection and classification, 5 discussed segmentation and localization of 
      ultra-widefield images (UWFIs), 3 discussed generative image synthesis, 3 
      discussed ophthalmic image quality assessment, and 2 discussed detecting systemic 
      diseases via UWF imaging. CONCLUSION: The application of DL to UWF imaging has 
      demonstrated significant effectiveness in the diagnosis and detection of 
      ophthalmic diseases including diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, and 
      glaucoma. DL has also been applied in the generation of synthetic ophthalmic 
      images. This scoping review highlights and discusses the current uses of DL with 
      UWF imaging, and the future of DL applications in this field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common cause of vision loss, is 
      caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. If untreated, it may 
      result in varying degrees of vision loss and even blindness. Since DR is a silent 
      disease that may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems, annual eye exams 
      are crucial for early detection to improve chances of effective treatment where 
      fundus cameras are used to capture retinal image. However, fundus cameras are too 
      big and heavy to be transported easily and too costly to be purchased by every 
      health clinic, so fundus cameras are an inconvenient tool for widespread 
      screening. Recent technological developments have enabled to use of smartphones 
      in designing small-sized, low-power, and affordable retinal imaging systems to 
      perform DR screening and automated DR detection using image processing methods. 
      In this paper, we investigate the smartphone-based portable retinal imaging 
      systems available on the market and compare their image quality and the automatic 
      DR detection accuracy using a deep learning framework. RESULTS: Based on the 
      results, iNview retinal imaging system has the largest field of view and better 
      image quality compared with iExaminer, D-Eye, and Peek Retina systems. The 
      overall classification accuracy of smartphone-based systems are sorted as 61%, 
      62%, 69%, and 75% for iExaminer, D-Eye, Peek Retina, and iNview images, 
      respectively. We observed that the network DR detection performance decreases as 
      the field of view of the smartphone-based retinal systems get smaller where 
      iNview is the largest and iExaminer is the smallest. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      smartphone-based retina imaging systems can be used as an alternative to the 
      direct ophthalmoscope. However, the field of view of the smartphone-based retina 
      imaging systems plays an important role in determining the automatic DR detection 
      accuracy.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of avoidable vision loss, 
      predominantly affecting the working-age population across the globe. Screening 
      for DR, coupled with timely consultation and treatment, is a globally trusted 
      policy to avoid vision loss. However, implementation of DR screening programs is 
      challenging due to the scarcity of medical professionals able to screen a growing 
      global diabetic population at risk for DR. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in 
      retinal image analysis could provide a sustainable approach for such large-scale 
      screening effort. The recent scientific advances in computing capacity and 
      machine learning approaches provide an avenue for biomedical scientists to reach 
      this goal. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic DR diagnosis, a 
      grand challenge on "Diabetic Retinopathy - Segmentation and Grading" was 
      organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical 
      Imaging (ISBI - 2018). In this paper, we report the set-up and results of this 
      challenge that is primarily based on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset 
      (IDRiD). There were three principal sub-challenges: lesion segmentation, disease 
      severity grading, and localization of retinal landmarks and segmentation. These 
      multiple tasks in this challenge allow to test the generalizability of 
      algorithms, and this is what makes it different from existing ones. It received a 
      positive response from the scientific community with 148 submissions from 495 
      registrations effectively entered in this challenge. This paper outlines the 
      challenge, its organization, the dataset used, evaluation methods and results of 
      top-performing participating solutions. The top-performing approaches utilized a 
      blend of clinical information, data augmentation, and an ensemble of models. 
      These findings have the potential to enable new developments in retinal image 
      analysis and image-based DR screening in particular.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being studied for the 
      screening, diagnosis, and management of diabetes and its complications. Although 
      various models of ML have been developed, most have not led to practical 
      solutions for real-world problems. There has been a disconnect between ML 
      developers, regulatory bodies, health services researchers, clinicians, and 
      patients in their efforts. Our aim is to review the current status of ML in 
      various aspects of diabetes care and identify key challenges that must be 
      overcome to leverage ML to its full potential. RECENT FINDINGS: ML has led to 
      impressive progress in development of automated insulin delivery systems and 
      diabetic retinopathy screening tools. Compared with these, use of ML in other 
      aspects of diabetes is still at an early stage. The Food & Drug Administration 
      (FDA) is adopting some innovative models to help bring technologies to the market 
      in an expeditious and safe manner. ML has great potential in managing diabetes 
      and the future is in furthering the partnership of regulatory bodies with health 
      service researchers, clinicians, developers, and patients to improve the outcomes 
      of populations and individual patients with diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a major cause of blindness, 
      is characterized by complex pathogenesis. This study integrates single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (scRNA-seq), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), machine 
      learning, and AlphaFold 2 methods to explore the molecular level of PDR. METHODS: 
      We analyzed scRNA-seq data from PDR patients and healthy controls to identify 
      distinct cellular subtypes and gene expression patterns. NMF was used to define 
      specific transcriptional programs in PDR. The oxidative stress-related genes 
      (ORGs) identified within Meta-Program 1 were utilized to construct a predictive 
      model using twelve machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we employed 
      AlphaFold 2 for the prediction of protein structures, complementing this with 
      molecular docking to validate the structural foundation of potential therapeutic 
      targets. We also analyzed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and the 
      interplay among key ORGs. RESULTS: Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed five major 
      cell types and 14 subcell types in PDR patients, with significant differences in 
      gene expression compared to those in controls. We identified three key 
      meta-programs underscoring the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of PDR. 
      Three critical ORGs (ALKBH1, PSIP1, and ATP13A2) were identified, with the 
      best-performing predictive model demonstrating high accuracy (AUC of 0.989 in the 
      training cohort and 0.833 in the validation cohort). Moreover, AlphaFold 2 
      predictions combined with molecular docking revealed that resveratrol has a 
      strong affinity for ALKBH1, indicating its potential as a targeted therapeutic 
      agent. PPI network analysis, revealed a complex network of interactions among the 
      hub ORGs and other genes, suggesting a collective role in PDR pathogenesis. 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the cellular and molecular aspects 
      of PDR, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets using advanced 
      technological approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening via deep learning (DL) 
      and trained human graders (HG) in a longitudinal cohort, as case spectrum shifts 
      based on treatment referral and new-onset DR. METHODS: We randomly selected 
      patients with diabetes screened twice, two years apart within a nationwide 
      screening program. The reference standard was established via adjudication by 
      retina specialists. Each patient's color fundus photographs were graded, and a 
      patient was considered as having sight-threatening DR (STDR) if the worse eye had 
      severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, or diabetic macular edema. We 
      compared DR screening via two modalities: DL and HG. For each modality, we 
      simulated treatment referral by excluding patients with detected STDR from the 
      second screening using that modality. RESULTS: There were 5,738 patients (12.3% 
      STDR) in the first screening. DL and HG captured different numbers of STDR cases, 
      and after simulated referral and excluding ungradable cases, 4,148 and 4,263 
      patients remained in the second screening, respectively. The STDR prevalence at 
      the second screening was 5.1% and 6.8% for DL- and HG-based screening, 
      respectively. Along with the prevalence decrease, the sensitivity for both 
      modalities decreased from the first to the second screening (DL: from 95% to 90%, 
      p = 0.008; HG: from 74% to 57%, p < 0.001). At both the first and second 
      screenings, the rate of false negatives for the DL was a fifth that of HG 
      (0.5-0.6% vs. 2.9-3.2%). CONCLUSION: On 2-year longitudinal follow-up of a DR 
      screening cohort, STDR prevalence decreased for both DL- and HG-based screening. 
      Follow-up screenings in longitudinal DR screening can be more difficult and 
      induce lower sensitivity for both DL and HG, though the false negative rate was 
      substantially lower for DL. Our data may be useful for health-economics analyses 
      of longitudinal screening settings.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults 
      worldwide. Neovascular leakage on fluorescein angiography indicates progression 
      to the proliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy, which is an important 
      distinction that requires timely ophthalmic intervention with laser or 
      intravitreal injection treatment to reduce the risk of severe, permanent vision 
      loss. In this study, we developed a deep learning algorithm to detect neovascular 
      leakage on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography images obtained from patients 
      with diabetic retinopathy. The algorithm, an ensemble of three convolutional 
      neural networks, was able to accurately classify neovascular leakage and 
      distinguish this disease marker from other angiographic disease features. With 
      additional real-world validation and testing, our algorithm could facilitate 
      identification of neovascular leakage in the clinical setting, allowing timely 
      intervention to reduce the burden of blinding diabetic eye disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is an important technique 
      to evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other retinal diseases. The 
      interpretation of FFA images is complex and time-consuming, and the ability of 
      diagnosis is uneven among different ophthalmologists. The aim of the study is to 
      develop a clinically usable multilevel classification deep learning model for FFA 
      images, including prediagnosis assessment and lesion classification. METHODS: A 
      total of 15 599 FFA images of 1558 eyes from 845 patients diagnosed with DR were 
      collected and annotated. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models were 
      trained to generate the label of image quality, location, laterality of eye, 
      phase and five lesions. Performance of the models was evaluated by accuracy, F-1 
      score, the area under the curve and human-machine comparison. The images with 
      false positive and false negative results were analysed in detail. RESULTS: 
      Compared with LeNet-5 and VGG16, ResNet18 got the best result, achieving an 
      accuracy of 80.79%-93.34% for prediagnosis assessment and an accuracy of 
      63.67%-88.88% for lesion detection. The human-machine comparison showed that the 
      CNN had similar accuracy with junior ophthalmologists. The false positive and 
      false negative analysis indicated a direction of improvement. CONCLUSION: This is 
      the first study to do automated standardised labelling on FFA images. Our model 
      is able to be applied in clinical practice, and will make great contributions to 
      the development of intelligent diagnosis of FFA images.

TI  - DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, CLASSIFIED USING THE LESION-AWARE DEEP LEARNING SYSTEM, 
      PREDICTS DIABETIC END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE IN CHINESE PATIENTS.
PG  - 429-443
LID - 10.4158/EP-2019-0512 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To characterize the relationship between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and 
      diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Chinese patients and to determine whether the 
      severity of DR predicts end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: Bilateral fundic 
      photographs of 91 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with biopsy-confirmed DN, not 
      in ESRD stage, were obtained at the time of renal biopsy in this longitudinal 
      study. The baseline severity of DR was determined using the Lesion-aware Deep 
      Learning System (RetinalNET) in an open framework for deep learning and was 
      graded using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. Cox 
      proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the 
      effect of the severity of diabetic retinopathy on ESRD. Results: During a median 
      follow-up of 15 months, 25 patients progressed to ESRD. The severity of 
      retinopathy at the time of biopsy was a prognostic factor for progression to ESRD 
      (HR 2.18, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.53, P = .04). At baseline, more 
      severe retinopathy was associated with poor renal function, and more severe 
      glomerular lesions. However, 30% of patients with mild retinopathy and severe 
      glomerular lesions had higher low-density lipo-protein-cholesterol and more 
      severe proteinuria than those with mild glomerular lesions. Additionally, 3% of 
      patients with severe retinopathy and mild glomerular changes were more likely to 
      have had diabetes a long time than those with severe glomerular lesions. 
      Conclusion: Although the severity of DR predicted diabetic ESRD in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and DN, the severities of DR and DN were not always 
      consistent, especially in patients with mild retinopathy or microalbuminuria.

TI  - URNet: System for recommending referrals for community screening of diabetic 
      retinopathy based on deep learning.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) will cause blindness if the detection and treatment are 
      not carried out in the early stages. To create an effective treatment strategy, 
      the severity of the disease must first be divided into referral-warranted 
      diabetic retinopathy (RWDR) and non-referral diabetic retinopathy (NRDR). 
      However, there are usually no sufficient fundus examinations due to lack of 
      professional service in the communities, particularly in the developing 
      countries. In this study, we introduce UGAN_Resnet_CBAM (URNet; UGAN is a 
      generative adversarial network that uses Unet for feature extraction), a 
      two-stage end-to-end deep learning technique for the automatic detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy. The characteristics of DDR fundus data set were used to 
      design an adaptive image preprocessing module in the first stage. 
      Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and t-distribution and 
      stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) were used as the evaluation indices to 
      analyze the preprocessing results. In the second stage, we enhanced the 
      performance of the Resnet50 network by integrating the convolutional block 
      attention module (CBAM). The outcomes demonstrate that our proposed solution 
      outperformed other current structures, achieving 94.5% and 94.4% precisions, and 
      96.2% and 91.9% recall for NRDR and RWDR, respectively.

TI  - Performance of a Support Vector Machine Learning Tool for Diagnosing Diabetic 
      Retinopathy in Clinical Practice.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13071128 [doi]
LID - 1128
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the real-world performance of a support vector machine 
      learning software (RetinaLyze) in order to identify the possible presence of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with diabetes via software implementation 
      in clinical practice. METHODS: 1001 eyes from 1001 patients-one eye per 
      patient-participating in the Danish National Screening Programme were included. 
      Three independent ophthalmologists graded all eyes according to the International 
      Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale with the exact level of 
      disease being determined by majority decision. The software detected DR and no DR 
      and was compared to the ophthalmologists' gradings. RESULTS: At a clinical chosen 
      threshold, the software showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      value and negative predictive value of 84.9% (95% CI: 81.8-87.9), 89.9% (95% CI: 
      86.8-92.7), 92.1% (95% CI: 89.7-94.4), and 81.0% (95% CI: 77.2-84.7), 
      respectively, when compared to human grading. The results from the routine 
      screening were 87.0% (95% CI: 84.2-89.7), 85.3% (95% CI: 81.8-88.6), 89.2% (95% 
      CI: 86.3-91.7), and 82.5% (95% CI: 78.5-86.0), respectively. AUC was 93.4%. The 
      reference graders Conger's Exact Kappa was 0.827. CONCLUSION: The software 
      performed similarly to routine grading with overlapping confidence intervals, 
      indicating comparable performance between the two groups. The intergrader 
      agreement was satisfactory. However, evaluating the updated software alongside 
      updated clinical procedures is crucial. It is therefore recommended that further 
      clinical testing before implementation of the software as a decision support tool 
      is conducted.

      uncertainty quantification.
PG  - 2797-2811
LID - 10.1007/s11517-022-02633-w [doi]
AB  - In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have provided state-of-the-art 
      performance in medical imaging. However, good quality (annotated) medical data is 
      in general hard to find due to the usually high cost of medical images, limited 
      availability of expert annotators (e.g., radiologists), and the amount of time 
      required for annotation. In addition, DL is data-hungry and its training requires 
      extensive computational resources. Furthermore, DL being a black-box method lacks 
      transparency on its inner working and lacks fundamental understanding behind 
      decisions made by the model and consequently, this notion enhances the 
      uncertainty on its predictions. To this end, we address these challenges by 
      proposing a hybrid model, which uses a Bayesian convolutional neural network 
      (BCNN) for uncertainty quantification, and an active learning approach for 
      annotating the unlabeled data. The BCNN is used as a feature descriptor and these 
      features are then used for training a model, in an active learning setting. We 
      evaluate the proposed framework for diabetic retinopathy classification problem 
      and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of different metrics.

TI  - Segmentation-Assisted Fully Convolutional Neural Network Enhances Deep Learning 
      Performance to Identify Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12010385 [doi]
LID - 385
AB  - With the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) from the non-proliferative 
      (NPDR) to proliferative (PDR) stage, the possibility of vision impairment 
      increases significantly. Therefore, it is clinically important to detect the 
      progression to PDR stage for proper intervention. We propose a 
      segmentation-assisted DR classification methodology, that builds on (and 
      improves) current methods by using a fully convolutional network (FCN) to segment 
      retinal neovascularizations (NV) in retinal images prior to image classification. 
      This study utilizes the Kaggle EyePacs dataset, containing retinal photographs 
      from patients with varying degrees of DR (mild, moderate, severe NPDR and PDR. 
      Two graders annotated the NV (a board-certified ophthalmologist and a trained 
      medical student). Segmentation was performed by training an FCN to locate 
      neovascularization on 669 retinal fundus photographs labeled with PDR status 
      according to NV presence. The trained segmentation model was used to locate 
      probable NV in images from the classification dataset. Finally, a CNN was trained 
      to classify the combined images and probability maps into categories of PDR. The 
      mean accuracy of segmentation-assisted classification was 87.71% on the test set 
      (SD = 7.71%). Segmentation-assisted classification of PDR achieved accuracy that 
      was 7.74% better than classification alone. Our study shows that segmentation 
      assistance improves identification of the most severe stage of diabetic 
      retinopathy and has the potential to improve deep learning performance in other 
      imaging problems with limited data availability.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an unstoppable force that is starting to permeate 
      all aspects of our society as part of the revolution being brought into our lives 
      (and into medicine) by the digital era, and accelerated by the current COVID-19 
      pandemic. As the population ages and developing countries move forward, AI-based 
      systems may be a key asset in streamlining the screening, staging, and treatment 
      planning of sight-threatening eye conditions, offloading the most tedious tasks 
      from the experts, allowing for a greater population coverage, and bringing the 
      best possible care to every patient. This paper presents a review of the state of 
      the art of AI in the field of ophthalmology, focusing on the strengths and 
      weaknesses of current systems, and defining the vision that will enable us to 
      advance scientifically in this digital era. It starts with a thorough yet 
      accessible introduction to the algorithms underlying all modern AI applications. 
      Then, a critical review of the main AI applications in ophthalmology is 
      presented, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      retinopathy of prematurity, glaucoma, and other AI-related topics such as image 
      enhancement. The review finishes with a brief discussion on the opportunities and 
      challenges that the future of this field might hold.

TI  - UC-stack: a deep learning computer automatic detection system for diabetic 
      retinopathy classification.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ad22a1 [doi]
AB  - Object. The existing diagnostic paradigm for diabetic retinopathy (DR) greatly 
      relies on subjective assessments by medical practitioners utilizing optical 
      imaging, introducing susceptibility to individual interpretation. This work 
      presents a novel system for the early detection and grading of DR, providing an 
      automated alternative to the manual examination.Approach. First, we use advanced 
      image preprocessing techniques, specifically contrast-limited adaptive histogram 
      equalization and Gaussian filtering, with the goal of enhancing image quality and 
      module learning capabilities. Second, a deep learning-based automatic detection 
      system is developed. The system consists of a feature segmentation module, a deep 
      learning feature extraction module, and an ensemble classification module. The 
      feature segmentation module accomplishes vascular segmentation, the deep learning 
      feature extraction module realizes the global feature and local feature 
      extraction of retinopathy images, and the ensemble module performs the diagnosis 
      and classification of DR for the extracted features. Lastly, nine performance 
      evaluation metrics are applied to assess the quality of the model's 
      performance.Main results. Extensive experiments are conducted on four retinal 
      image databases (APTOS 2019, Messidor, DDR, and EyePACS). The proposed method 
      demonstrates promising performance in the binary and multi-classification tasks 
      for DR, evaluated through nine indicators, including AUC and quadratic weighted 
      Kappa score. The system shows the best performance in the comparison of three 
      segmentation methods, two convolutional neural network architecture models, four 
      Swin Transformer structures, and the latest literature methods.Significance. In 
      contrast to existing methods, our system demonstrates superior performance across 
      multiple indicators, enabling accurate screening of DR and providing valuable 
      support to clinicians in the diagnostic process. Our automated approach minimizes 
      the reliance on subjective assessments, contributing to more consistent and 
      reliable DR evaluations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is a general term that means to accomplish a task mainly 
      by a computer, with the least human beings participation, and it is widely 
      accepted as the invention of robots. With the development of this new technology, 
      artificial intelligence has been one of the most influential information 
      technology revolutions. We searched these English-language studies relative to 
      ophthalmology published on PubMed and Springer databases. The application of 
      artificial intelligence in ophthalmology mainly concentrates on the diseases with 
      a high incidence, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related or congenital cataract and few 
      with retinal vein occlusion. According to the above studies, we conclude that the 
      sensitivity of detection and accuracy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
      ranged from 75% to 91.7%, for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 
      75% to 94.7%, for age-related macular degeneration it ranged from 75% to 100%, 
      for retinopathy of prematurity ranged over 95%, for retinal vein occlusion just 
      one study reported ranged over 97%, for glaucoma ranged 63.7% to 93.1%, and for 
      cataract it achieved a more than 70% similarity against clinical grading.

TI  - Diabetic retinopathy screening in the emerging era of artificial intelligence.
PG  - 1415-1423
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05727-0 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a frequent complication in diabetes and a leading cause 
      of visual impairment. Regular eye screening is imperative to detect 
      sight-threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy such as proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema in order to treat these before 
      irreversible visual loss occurs. Screening is cost-effective and has been 
      implemented in various countries in Europe and elsewhere. Along with optimised 
      diabetes care, this has substantially reduced the risk of visual loss. 
      Nevertheless, the growing number of patients with diabetes poses an increasing 
      burden on healthcare systems and automated solutions are needed to alleviate the 
      task of screening and improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning by convolutional 
      neural networks is an optimised branch of artificial intelligence that is 
      particularly well suited to automated image analysis. Pivotal studies have 
      demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for classifying advanced stages of 
      diabetic retinopathy and identifying diabetic macular oedema in optical coherence 
      tomography scans. Based on this, different algorithms have obtained regulatory 
      approval for clinical use and have recently been implemented to some extent in a 
      few countries. Handheld mobile devices are another promising option for 
      self-monitoring, but so far they have not demonstrated comparable image quality 
      to that of fundus photography using non-portable retinal cameras, which is the 
      gold standard for diabetic retinopathy screening. Such technology has the 
      potential to be integrated in telemedicine-based screening programmes, enabling 
      self-captured retinal images to be transferred virtually to reading centres for 
      analysis and planning of further steps. While emerging technologies have shown a 
      lot of promise, clinical implementation has been sparse. Legal obstacles and 
      difficulties in software integration may partly explain this, but it may also 
      indicate that existing algorithms may not necessarily integrate well with 
      national screening initiatives, which often differ substantially between 
      countries.

TI  - Neovascularization Detection and Localization in Fundus Images Using Deep 
      Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s21165327 [doi]
LID - 5327
AB  - Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is a severe retinal disease that 
      threatens diabetic patients. It is characterized by neovascularization in the 
      retina and the optic disk. PDR clinical features contain highly intense retinal 
      neovascularization and fibrous spreads, leading to visual distortion if not 
      controlled. Different image processing techniques have been proposed to detect 
      and diagnose neovascularization from fundus images. Recently, deep learning 
      methods are getting popular in neovascularization detection due to artificial 
      intelligence advancement in biomedical image processing. This paper presents a 
      semantic segmentation convolutional neural network architecture for 
      neovascularization detection. First, image pre-processing steps were applied to 
      enhance the fundus images. Then, the images were divided into small patches, 
      forming a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. A semantic 
      segmentation convolutional neural network was designed and trained to detect the 
      neovascularization regions on the images. Finally, the network was tested using 
      the testing set for performance evaluation. The proposed model is entirely 
      automated in detecting and localizing neovascularization lesions, which is not 
      possible with previously published methods. Evaluation results showed that the 
      model could achieve accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Jaccard 
      similarity, and Dice similarity of 0.9948, 0.8772, 0.9976, 0.8696, 0.7643, and 
      0.8466, respectively. We demonstrated that this model could outperform other 
      convolutional neural network models in neovascularization detection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect diabetic kideny 
      disease (DKD) from retinal photographs of patients with diabetes, and evaluate 
      performance in multiethnic populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained 3 
      models: (1) image-only; (2) risk factor (RF)-only multivariable logistic 
      regression (LR) model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes duration, HbA1c, 
      systolic blood pressure; (3) hybrid multivariable LR model combining RF data and 
      standardized z-scores from image-only model. Data from Singapore Integrated 
      Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP) were used to develop (6066 participants with 
      diabetes, primary-care-based) and internally validate (5-fold cross-validation) 
      the models. External testing on 2 independent datasets: (1) Singapore 
      Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study (1885 participants with diabetes, 
      population-based); (2) Singapore Macroangiopathy and Microvascular Reactivity in 
      Type 2 Diabetes (SMART2D) (439 participants with diabetes, cross-sectional) in 
      Singapore. Supplementary external testing on 2 Caucasian cohorts: (3) Australian 
      Eye and Heart Study (AHES) (460 participants with diabetes, cross-sectional) and 
      (4) Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) (265 
      participants with diabetes, cross-sectional). RESULTS: In SiDRP validation, area 
      under the curve (AUC) was 0.826(95% CI 0.818-0.833) for image-only, 
      0.847(0.840-0.854) for RF-only, and 0.866(0.859-0.872) for hybrid. Estimates with 
      SEED were 0.764(0.743-0.785) for image-only, 0.802(0.783-0.822) for RF-only, and 
      0.828(0.810-0.846) for hybrid. In SMART2D, AUC was 0.726(0.686-0.765) for 
      image-only, 0.701(0.660-0.741) in RF-only, 0.761(0.724-0.797) for hybrid. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There is potential for DLA using retinal images as a 
      screening adjunct for DKD among individuals with diabetes. This can value-add to 
      existing DLA systems which diagnose diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, 
      facilitating primary screening for DKD.

      intelligence", "Deep learning", "Smartphone", "Triage", "Screening", 
      "Home-based", "Monitoring", "Ophthalmology", "Diabetes", "Diabetic Retinopathy", 
      "Retinal imaging". Full-text English language studies from January 1, 2010, to 
      February 1, 2022, and reference lists were considered for the conceptual 
      framework of this review. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus and its eye complications, 
      including DR, are particularly well suited to digital technologies, providing an 
      ideal model for telehealth initiatives and real-world applications. The current 
      development in the adoption of telemedicine, artificial intelligence and remote 
      monitoring as an alternative to or in addition to traditional forms of care will 
      be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in digital health have created an ecosystem 
      ripe for telemedicine in the field of DR to thrive. Stakeholders and policymakers 
      should adopt a participatory approach to ensure sustained implementation of these 
      technologies after the COVID-19 pandemic. This article belongs to the Topical

AB  - Deep learning is a genre of machine learning that allows computational models to 
      learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction using numerous 
      processing layers. A distinctive feature of deep learning, compared with 
      conventional machine learning methods, is that it can generate appropriate models 
      for tasks directly from the raw data, removing the need for human-led feature 
      extraction. Medical images are particularly suited for deep learning 
      applications. Deep learning techniques have already demonstrated high performance 
      in the detection of diabetic retinopathy on fundoscopic images and metastatic 
      breast cancer cells on pathologic images. In radiology, deep learning has the 
      opportunity to provide improved accuracy of image interpretation and diagnosis. 
      Many groups are exploring the possibility of using deep learning-based 
      applications to solve unmet clinical needs. In chest imaging, there has been a 
      large effort to develop and apply computer-aided detection systems for the 
      detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs and chest computed tomography. The 
      essential limitation to computer-aided detection is an inability to learn from 
      new information. To overcome these deficiencies, many groups have turned to deep 
      learning approaches with promising results. In addition to nodule detection, 
      interstitial lung disease recognition, lesion segmentation, diagnosis and patient 
      outcomes have been addressed by deep learning approaches. The purpose of this 
      review article was to cover the current state of the art for deep learning 
      approaches and its limitations, and some of the potential impact on the field of 
      radiology, with specific reference to chest imaging.

TI  - Deep learning innovations in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy: The potential of 
      transfer learning and the DiaCNN model.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant cause of vision impairment, 
      emphasizing the critical need for early detection and timely intervention to 
      avert visual deterioration. Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it 
      necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by 
      experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for 
      effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic 
      methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in 
      terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel 
      method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional 
      methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach 
      is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of 
      pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and 
      Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the 
      unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also 
      present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification 
      of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged 
      the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight 
      different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The 
      InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an 
      impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its 
      counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% 
      accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model 
      showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% 
      in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy 
      when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such 
      advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of 
      our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease 
      diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this 
      approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness 
      associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. 
      Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only 
      pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a 
      transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to 
      substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the efficacy of a deep learning (DL)-based artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in detecting the presence of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma suspect as compared to the diagnosis by specialists 
      secondarily to explore whether the use of this algorithm can reduce the 
      cross-referral in three clinical settings: a diabetologist clinic, retina clinic, 
      and glaucoma clinic. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study. Patients 
      between 35 and 65 years of age were recruited from glaucoma and retina clinics at 
      a tertiary eye care hospital and a physician's clinic. Non-mydriatic fundus 
      photography was performed according to the disease-specific protocols. These 
      images were graded by the AI system and specialist graders and comparatively 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 1085 patients, 362 were seen at glaucoma clinics, 341 
      were seen at retina clinics, and 382 were seen at physician clinics. The kappa 
      agreement between AI and the glaucoma grader was 85% [95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 77.55-92.45%], and retina grading had 91.90% (95% CI: 87.78-96.02%). The 
      retina grader from the glaucoma clinic had 85% agreement, and the glaucoma grader 
      from the retina clinic had 73% agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of AI 
      glaucoma grading were 79.37% (95% CI: 67.30-88.53%) and 99.45 (95% CI: 
      98.03-99.93), respectively; DR grading had 83.33% (95 CI: 51.59-97.91) and 98.86 
      (95% CI: 97.35-99.63). The cross-referral accuracy of DR and glaucoma was 89.57% 
      and 95.43%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DL-based AI systems showed high sensitivity 
      and specificity in both patients with DR and glaucoma; also, there was a good 
      agreement between the specialist graders and the AI system.

TI  - Machine Learning Models for Prediction of Diabetic Microvascular Complications.
PG  - 273-286
LID - 10.1177/19322968231223726 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE AND AIMS: Diabetic microvascular complications significantly impact 
      morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on machine learning/artificial 
      intelligence (ML/AI) in predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN). METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed 
      search from 1990 to 2023 identified studies on ML/AI models for diabetic 
      microvascular complications. The review analyzed study design, cohorts, 
      predictors, ML techniques, prediction horizon, and performance metrics. RESULTS: 
      Among the 74 identified studies, 256 featured internally validated ML models and 
      124 had externally validated models, with about half being retrospective. Since 
      2010, there has been a rise in the use of ML for predicting microvascular 
      complications, mainly driven by DKD research across 27 countries. A more modest 
      increase in ML research on DR and DN was observed, with publications from fewer 
      countries. For all microvascular complications, predictive models achieved a mean 
      (standard deviation) c-statistic of 0.79 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.72 
      (0.12) on external validation. Diabetic kidney disease models had the highest 
      discrimination, with c-statistics of 0.81 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.74 
      (0.13) on external validation, respectively. Few studies externally validated 
      prediction of DN. The prediction horizon, outcome definitions, number and type of 
      predictors, and ML technique significantly influenced model performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is growing global interest in using ML for 
      predicting diabetic microvascular complications. Research on DKD is the most 
      advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance. Both 
      DR and DN require more research. External validation and adherence to recommended 
      guidelines are crucial.

TI  - Evaluation of a deep learning system for the joint automated detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 368-377
LID - 10.1111/aos.14306 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the performance of a commercially available, CE-certified 
      deep learning (DL) system, RetCAD v.1.3.0 (Thirona, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), 
      for the joint automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD) in colour fundus (CF) images on a dataset with mixed 
      presence of eye diseases. METHODS: Evaluation of joint detection of referable DR 
      and AMD was performed on a DR-AMD dataset with 600 images acquired during routine 
      clinical practice, containing referable and non-referable cases of both diseases. 
      Each image was graded for DR and AMD by an experienced ophthalmologist to 
      establish the reference standard (RS), and by four independent observers for 
      comparison with human performance. Validation was furtherly assessed on Messidor 
      (1200 images) for individual identification of referable DR, and the Age-Related 
      Eye Disease Study (AREDS) dataset (133 821 images) for referable AMD, against the 
      corresponding RS. RESULTS: Regarding joint validation on the DR-AMD dataset, the 
      system achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 95.1% for detection of 
      referable DR (SE = 90.1%, SP = 90.6%). For referable AMD, the AUC was 94.9% 
      (SE = 91.8%, SP = 87.5%). Average human performance for DR was SE = 61.5% and 
      SP = 97.8%; for AMD, SE = 76.5% and SP = 96.1%. Regarding detection of referable 
      DR in Messidor, AUC was 97.5% (SE = 92.0%, SP = 92.1%); for referable AMD in 
      AREDS, AUC was 92.7% (SE = 85.8%, SP = 86.0%). CONCLUSION: The validated system 
      performs comparably to human experts at simultaneous detection of DR and AMD. 
      This shows that DL systems can facilitate access to joint screening of eye 
      diseases and become a quick and reliable support for ophthalmological experts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this article, we present a computerized system for the analysis 
      and assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on retinal fundus photographs. 
      DR is a chronic ophthalmic disease and a major reason for blindness in people 
      with diabetes. Consistent examination and prompt diagnosis are the vital 
      approaches to control DR. METHODS: With the aim of enhancing the reliability of 
      DR diagnosis, we utilized the deep learning model called You Only Look Once V3 
      (YOLO V3) to recognize and classify DR from retinal images. The DR was classified 
      into five major stages: normal, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative. We 
      evaluated the performance of the YOLO V3 algorithm based on color fundus images. 
      RESULTS: We have achieved high precision and sensitivity on the train and test 
      data for the DR classification and mean average precision (mAP) is calculated on 
      DR lesion detection. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the suggested model 
      distinguishes all phases of DR and performs better than existing models in terms 
      of accuracy and implementation time.

AB  - This study investigates the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on a 
      deep learning algorithm in the diagnosis of diabetic macular edema (DME) 
      patients. A total of 96 patients with DME were randomly divided into the 
      experimental group (N  = 48) and the control group (N  = 48). A deep learning 3D 
      convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) algorithm for MRI images of patients with 
      DME was designed. The application value of this algorithm was comprehensively 
      evaluated by MRI image segmentation Dice value, sensitivity, specificity, and 
      other indicators and diagnostic accuracy. The results showed that the quality of 
      MRI images processed by the 3D-CNN algorithm based on deep learning was 
      significantly improved, and the Dice value, sensitivity, and specificity index 
      data were significantly better than those of the traditional CNN algorithm (P < 
      0.05). In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI images processed by this 
      algorithm was 93.78 ± 5.32%, which was significantly better than the diagnostic 
      accuracy of 64.25 ± 10.24% of traditional MRI images in the control group (P < 
      0.05). In summary, the 3D-CNN algorithm based on deep learning can significantly 
      improve the accuracy and sensitivity of MRI image recognition and segmentation in 
      patients with DME, can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in 
      patients with DME, and has a good clinical application value.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the number of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the 
      USA is expected to increase threefold by 2050, the need to reduce health care 
      costs associated with screening for this treatable disease is ever present. 
      Crowdsourcing and automated retinal image analysis (ARIA) are two areas where new 
      technology has been applied to reduce costs in screening for DR. This paper 
      reviews the current literature surrounding these new technologies. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Crowdsourcing has high sensitivity for normal vs abnormal images; 
      however, when multiple categories for severity of DR are added, specificity is 
      reduced. ARIAs have higher sensitivity and specificity, and some commercial ARIA 
      programs are already in use. Deep learning enhanced ARIAs appear to offer even 
      more improvement in ARIA grading accuracy. The utilization of crowdsourcing and 
      ARIAs may be a key to reducing the time and cost burden of processing images from 
      DR screening.

TI  - DRISTI: a hybrid deep neural network for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
PG  - 1679-1686
LID - 10.1007/s11760-021-01904-7 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant reason for the global increase in 
      visual loss. Studies show that timely treatment can significantly bring down such 
      incidents. Hence, it is essential to distinguish the stages and severity of DR to 
      recommend needed medical attention. In this view, this paper presents DRISTI 
      (Diabetic Retinopathy classIfication by analySing reTinal Images), where a hybrid 
      deep learning model composed of VGG16 and capsule network is proposed, which 
      yields statistically significant performance improvement over the state of the 
      art. To validate our claim, we have reported detailed experimental and ablation 
      studies. We have also created an augmented dataset to increase the APTOS 
      dataset's size and check how robust the model is. The five-class training and 
      validation accuracy for the expanded dataset is 99.21% and 75.50% . The two-class 
      training and validation accuracy on augmented APTOS is 99.96% and 97.05% . 
      Extending the two-class model for the mixed dataset, we get a training and 
      validation accuracy of 99.92% and 91.43% , respectively. We have also performed 
      cross-dataset and mixed dataset testing to demonstrate the efficiency of DRISTI.

TI  - Quantification of Nonperfusion Area in Montaged Widefield OCT Angiography Using 
      Deep Learning in Diabetic Retinopathy.
PG  - 100027

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of a deep learning-based algorithm to quantify 
      the nonperfusion area (NPA) on montaged widefield OCT angiography (OCTA) for 
      assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-seven participants with a full range of DR 
      severity and 26 healthy participants. METHODS: A deep learning-based algorithm 
      was developed for detecting and quantifying NPA in the superficial vascular 
      complex on widefield OCTA comprising 3 horizontally montaged 6 × 6-mm OCTA scans 
      from the nasal, macular, and temporal regions. We trained the algorithm on 978 
      volumetric OCTA scans from all participants using 5-fold cross-validation. The 
      algorithm can distinguish NPA from shadow artifacts. The F1 score evaluated 
      segmentation accuracy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      and sensitivity with specificity fixed at 95% quantified network performance to 
      distinguish patients with diabetes from healthy control participants, referable 
      DR from nonreferable DR (nonproliferative DR [NPDR] less than moderate severity), 
      and severe DR (severe NPDR, proliferative DR, or DR with edema) from nonsevere DR 
      (mild to moderate NPDR). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Widefield OCTA NPA, visual acuity 
      (VA), and DR severities. RESULTS: Automatically segmented NPA showed high 
      agreement with the manually delineated ground truth, with a mean ± standard 
      deviation F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.05 in nasal, 0.82 ± 0.07 in macular, and 0.78 ± 
      0.05 in temporal scans. The extrafoveal avascular area (EAA) in the macular scan 
      showed the best sensitivity at 54% for differentiating those with diabetes from 
      healthy control participants, whereas montaged widefield OCTA scan showed 
      significantly higher sensitivity than macular scans (P < 0.0001, McNemar's test) 
      for detecting eyes with DR at 66%, referable DR at 63%, and severe DR at 62%. 
      Montaged widefield OCTA showed the highest correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.74; P < 
      0.0001) between EAA and DR severity. The macular scan showed the strongest 
      negative correlation (Pearson ρ = -0.42; P < 0.0001) between EAA and 
      best-corrected VA. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning-based algorithm for montaged 
      widefield OCTA can detect NPA accurately and can improve the detection of 
      clinically important DR.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one kind of eye disease that is caused by overtime 
      diabetes. Lots of patients around the world suffered from DR which may bring 
      about blindness. Early detection of DR is a rigid quest which can remind the DR 
      patients to seek corresponding treatments in time. This paper presents an 
      automatic image-level DR detection system using multiple well-trained deep 
      learning models. Besides, several deep learning models are integrated using the 
      Adaboost algorithm in order to reduce the bias of each single model. To explain 
      the results of DR detection, this paper provides weighted class activation maps 
      (CAMs) that can illustrate the suspected position of lesions. In the 
      pre-processing stage, eight image transformation ways are also introduced to help 
      augment the diversity of fundus images. Experiments demonstrate that the method 
      proposed by this paper has stronger robustness and acquires more excellent 
      performance than that of individual deep learning model.

AB  - Rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide has necessitated the implementation of 
      population-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs that can perform 
      retinal imaging and interpretation for extremely large patient cohorts in a rapid 
      and sensitive manner while minimizing inappropriate referrals to retina 
      specialists. While most current screening programs employ mydriatic or 
      nonmydriatic color fundus photography and trained image graders to identify 
      referable DR, new imaging modalities offer significant improvements in diagnostic 
      accuracy, throughput, and affordability. Smartphone-based fundus photography, 
      macular optical coherence tomography, ultrawide-field imaging, and artificial 
      intelligence-based image reading address limitations of current approaches and 
      will likely become necessary as DR becomes more prevalent. Here we review current 
      trends in imaging for DR screening and emerging technologies that show potential 
      for improving upon current screening approaches.

PG  - 3338-3350
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3012134 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning and especially deep learning techniques are dominating medical 
      image and data analysis. This article reviews machine learning approaches 
      proposed for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases during the last four years. Three 
      diseases are addressed in this survey, namely diabetic retinopathy, age-related 
      macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The review covers over 60 publications and 25 
      public datasets and challenges related to the detection, grading, and lesion 
      segmentation of the three considered diseases. Each section provides a summary of 
      the public datasets and challenges related to each pathology and the current 
      methods that have been applied to the problem. Furthermore, the recent machine 
      learning approaches used for retinal vessels segmentation, and methods of retinal 
      layers and fluid segmentation are reviewed. Two main imaging modalities are 
      considered in this survey, namely color fundus imaging, and optical coherence 
      tomography. Machine learning approaches that use eye measurements and visual 
      field data for glaucoma detection are also included in the survey. Finally, the 
      authors provide their views, expectations and the limitations of the future of 
      these techniques in the clinical practice.

TI  - A computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting various diabetic retinopathy 
      grades based on a hybrid deep learning technique.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious disease that may cause vision loss 
      unawares without any alarm. Therefore, it is essential to scan and audit the DR 
      progress continuously. In this respect, deep learning techniques achieved great 
      success in medical image analysis. Deep convolution neural network (CNN) 
      architectures are widely used in multi-label (ML) classification. It helps in 
      diagnosing normal and various DR grades: mild, moderate, and severe 
      non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). DR grades are formulated 
      by appearing multiple DR lesions simultaneously on the color retinal fundus 
      images. Many lesion types have various features that are difficult to segment and 
      distinguished by utilizing conventional and hand-crafted methods. Therefore, the 
      practical solution is to utilize an effective CNN model. In this paper, we 
      present a novel hybrid, deep learning technique, which is called E-DenseNet. We 
      integrated EyeNet and DenseNet models based on transfer learning. We customized 
      the traditional EyeNet by inserting the dense blocks and optimized the resulting 
      hybrid E-DensNet model's hyperparameters. The proposed system based on the 
      E-DenseNet model can accurately diagnose healthy and different DR grades from 
      various small and large ML color fundus images. We trained and tested our model 
      on four different datasets that were published from 2006 to 2019. The proposed 
      system achieved an average accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), 
      Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the quadratic Kappa score (QKS), and the 
      calculation time (T) in minutes (m) equal [Formula: see text], [Formula: see 
      text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], 0.883, and 3.5m respectively. 
      The experiments show promising results as compared with other systems.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the major cause of blindness, which seriously 
      threatens the world's vision health. Limited medical resources make early 
      diagnosis and a large-scale screening of DR difficult. Most of the current 
      automatic diagnostic methods are mostly based on deep learning and large-scale 
      labeled data. However, the insufficiency of manual annotations for medical images 
      still is a great challenge of training deep neural networks. Self-supervised 
      learning methods are proposed to learn general features from dataset without 
      manual annotations. Inspired by this, we proposed a deep learning based DR 
      classification model (SimCLR-DR). In this paper, we first use contrastive 
      self-learning algorithm to pre-train the encoder based on convolution network 
      with unlabeled retinal images, then retrain the encoder with classifier on a 
      small annotated training data to detect referable DR. The experimental results on 
      Kaggle dataset show that this proposed method can overcome the training data 
      insufficiency problem and performs better than transfer learning. SimCLR-DR is a 
      good beginning for other deep learning based medical image detection approaches 
      facing the challenge of insufficient annotated data. Figure presents an overview 
      of the proposed framework, which contains three main steps: (i) Data 
      preprocessing; (ii) Pretext task of SimCLR-DR based on contrastive learning; 
      (iii) Downstream Task of SimCLRDR based on CNN.

AB  - Over the last decade, advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
      have highlighted their potential as a diagnostic tool in the healthcare domain. 
      Despite the widespread availability of medical images, their usefulness is 
      severely hampered by a lack of access to labeled data. For example, while 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as an essential analytical tool 
      in image processing, their impact is curtailed by training limitations due to 
      insufficient labeled data availability. Transfer Learning enables models 
      developed for one task to be reused for a second task. Knowledge distillation 
      enables transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to another. However, it 
      suffers from limitations, and the two models' constraints need to be 
      architecturally similar. Knowledge distillation addresses some of the 
      shortcomings of transfer learning by generalizing a complex model to a lighter 
      model. However, some parts of the knowledge may not be distilled by knowledge 
      distillation sufficiently. In this paper, a novel knowledge distillation approach 
      using transfer learning is proposed. The proposed approach transfers the complete 
      knowledge of a model to a new smaller one. Unlabeled data are used in an 
      unsupervised manner to transfer the new smaller model's maximum amount of 
      knowledge. The proposed method can be beneficial in medical image analysis, where 
      labeled data are typically scarce. The proposed approach is evaluated in 
      classifying images for diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy on two publicly available 
      datasets, including Messidor and EyePACS. Simulation results demonstrate that the 
      approach effectively transfers knowledge from a complex model to a lighter one. 
      Furthermore, experimental results illustrate that different small models' 
      performance is improved significantly using unlabeled data and knowledge 
      distillation.

AB  - The number of diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients is increasing every year, and 
      this causes a public health problem. Therefore, regular diagnosis of diabetes 
      patients is necessary to avoid the progression of DR stages to advanced stages 
      that lead to blindness. Manual diagnosis requires effort and expertise and is 
      prone to errors and differing expert diagnoses. Therefore, artificial 
      intelligence techniques help doctors make a proper diagnosis and resolve 
      different opinions. This study developed three approaches, each with two systems, 
      for early diagnosis of DR disease progression. All colour fundus images have been 
      subjected to image enhancement and increasing contrast ROI through filters. All 
      features extracted by the DenseNet-121 and AlexNet (Dense-121 and Alex) were fed 
      to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to select important features and 
      reduce their dimensions. The first approach is to DR image analysis for early 
      prediction of DR disease progression by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 
      selected, low-dimensional features of Dense-121 and Alex models. The second 
      approach is to DR image analysis for early prediction of DR disease progression 
      is by integrating important and low-dimensional features of Dense-121 and Alex 
      models before and after PCA. The third approach is to DR image analysis for early 
      prediction of DR disease progression by ANN with the radiomic features. The 
      radiomic features are a combination of the features of the CNN models (Dense-121 
      and Alex) separately with the handcrafted features extracted by Discrete Wavelet 
      Transform (DWT), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fuzzy colour histogram (FCH), and 
      Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods. With the radiomic features of the 
      Alex model and the handcrafted features, ANN reached a sensitivity of 97.92%, an 
      AUC of 99.56%, an accuracy of 99.1%, a specificity of 99.4% and a precision of 
      99.06%.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to investigate changes of plasma cytokines and to develop 
      machine learning classifiers for predicting non-proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. RESULTS: There were 12 
      plasma cytokines significantly higher in the non-proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy group in the pilot cohort. The validation cohort showed that 
      angiopoietin 1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, tissue inhibitors of 
      metalloproteinase 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 were 
      significantly higher in the NPDR group. Machine learning algorithms using the 
      random forest yielded the best performance, with sensitivity of 92.3%, 
      specificity of 75%, PPV of 82.8%, NPV of 88.2% and area under the curve of 0.84. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Plasma angiopoietin 1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and 
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 were associated with presence of 
      non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and may be good biomarkers that play 
      important roles in pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In pilot cohort, 60 plasma cytokines were simultaneously measured. In 
      validation cohort, angiopoietin 1, CXC-chemokine ligand 16, platelet-derived 
      growth factor-BB, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1, tissue inhibitors of 
      metalloproteinase 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 were 
      validated using ELISA kits. Machine learning algorithms were developed to build a 
      prediction model for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish and evaluate an artificial 
      intelligence-based deep learning system (DLS) for automatic detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy. This could be important in developing an advanced tele-screening 
      system for diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: A DLS with a convolutional neural 
      network was developed to recognize fundus images of referable diabetic 
      retinopathy. A total data set of 41,866 color fundus images were obtained from 17 
      cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). Five experienced 
      retinal specialists and 15 ophthalmologists were recruited to verify images. For 
      training, 80% of the data set was used, and the other 20% served as the 
      validation data set. To effectively understand the learning process, the DLS 
      automatically superimposed a heatmap on the original image. The regions utilized 
      by the DLS were highlighted for diagnosis. RESULTS: Using the local validation 
      data set, the DLS achieved an area under the curve of 0.9824. Based on the manual 
      screening criteria, an operating point was set at about 0.9 sensitivity to 
      evaluate the DLS. Specificity was recorded at 0.9609 and sensitivity was 0.9003. 
      The DLSs showed excellent reliability, repeatability, and high efficiency. After 
      analyzing the misclassification, it was found that 88.6% of the false-positives 
      were mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) whereas, 81.6% of the 
      false-negatives were intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      DLS efficiently detected fundus images from complex sources in the real world. 
      Incorporating DLS technology in tele-screening will advance the current screening 
      programs to offer a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for detecting 
      diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label 
      and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few explanations on how 
      to make predictions. Inspired by Koch's Postulates, the foundation in 
      evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we propose to exploit the 
      interpretability of deep learning application in medical diagnosis. By isolating 
      neuron activation patterns from a diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector and 
      visualizing them, we can determine the symptoms that the DR detector identifies 
      as evidence to make prediction. To be specific, we first define novel 
      pathological descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode 
      both spatial and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the 
      symptom encoded in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to 
      synthesize medically plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, 
      we could even arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of 
      generated lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms 
      directly related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both 
      qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods. 
      Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our 
      second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data 
      augmentation.

      Deep Learning: Diagnostic Accuracy Assessment.
PG  - 250-257
LID - 10.1159/000512638 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a diagnostic system software for 
      the automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) on digital colour fundus 
      photographs, the 2019 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Inception-V3. 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 295 fundus images were analysed by the 
      CNN model and compared to a panel of ophthalmologists. Images were obtained from 
      a dataset acquired within a screening programme. Diagnostic accuracy measures and 
      respective 95% CI were calculated. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of 
      the CNN model in diagnosing referable DR was 81% (95% CI 66-90%) and 97% (95% CI 
      95-99%), respectively. Positive predictive value was 86% (95% CI 72-94%) and 
      negative predictive value 96% (95% CI 93-98%). The positive likelihood ratio was 
      33 (95% CI 15-75) and the negative was 0.20 (95% CI 0.11-0.35). Its clinical 
      impact is demonstrated by the change observed in the pre-test probability of 
      referable DR (assuming a prevalence of 16%) to a post-test probability for a 
      positive test result of 86% and for a negative test result of 4%. CONCLUSION: A 
      CNN model negative test result safely excludes DR, and its use may significantly 
      reduce the burden of ophthalmologists at reading centres.

      Without Manual Annotations.
PG  - 872214
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.872214 [doi]
LID - 872214
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy, as a severe public health problem associated 
      with vision loss, should be diagnosed early using an accurate screening tool. 
      While many previous deep learning models have been proposed for this disease, 
      they need sufficient professional annotation data to train the model, requiring 
      more expensive and time-consuming screening skills. METHOD: This study aims to 
      economize manual power and proposes a deep graph correlation network (DGCN) to 
      develop automated diabetic retinopathy grading without any professional 
      annotations. DGCN involves the novel deep learning algorithm of a graph 
      convolutional network to exploit inherent correlations from independent retinal 
      image features learned by a convolutional neural network. Three designed loss 
      functions of graph-center, pseudo-contrastive, and transformation-invariant 
      constrain the optimisation and application of the DGCN model in an automated 
      diabetic retinopathy grading task. RESULTS: To evaluate the DGCN model, this 
      study employed EyePACS-1 and Messidor-2 sets to perform grading results. It 
      achieved an accuracy of 89.9% (91.8%), sensitivity of 88.2% (90.2%), and 
      specificity of 91.3% (93.0%) on EyePACS-1 (Messidor-2) data set with a confidence 
      index of 95% and commendable effectiveness on receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curve and t-SNE plots. CONCLUSION: The grading capability of this study is 
      close to that of retina specialists, but superior to that of trained graders, 
      which demonstrates that the proposed DGCN provides an innovative route for 
      automated diabetic retinopathy grading and other computer-aided diagnostic 
      systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate prediction models for the risk of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized over the period between January 2010 
      and September 2018 were retrospectively collected. Eighteen baseline demographic 
      and clinical characteristics were used as predictors to train five 
      machine-learning models. The model that showed favorable predictive efficacy was 
      evaluated at annual follow-ups. Multi-point data of the patients in the test set 
      were utilized to further evaluate the model's performance. We also assessed the 
      relative prognostic importance of the selected risk factors for DR outcomes. 
      RESULTS: Of 7943 collected patients, 1692 (21.30%) developed DR during follow-up. 
      Among the five models, the XGBoost model achieved the highest predictive 
      performance with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.803, 88.9%, 
      74.0%, and 81.1%, respectively. The XGBoost model's AUCs in the different 
      follow-up periods were 0.834 to 0.966. In addition to the classical risk factors 
      of DR, serum uric acid (SUA), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total 
      cholesterol (TC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and triglyceride 
      (TG) were also identified to be important and strong predictors for the disease. 
      Compared with the clinical diagnosis method of DR, the XGBoost model achieved an 
      average of 2.895 years prior to the first diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      model achieved high performance in predicting the risk of DR among patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus at each time point. This study established the potential 
      of the XGBoost model to facilitate clinicians in identifying high-risk patients 
      and making type 2 diabetes management-related decisions.

AB  - Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the USA. Deep 
      learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become increasingly 
      common in studying the various factors involved in cardiovascular disease. The 
      usage of retinal scanning techniques to diagnose retinal diseases, such as 
      diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and others, 
      using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has 
      been extensively documented. Researchers are now looking to combine the power of 
      AI with the non-invasive ease of retinal scanning to examine the workings of the 
      heart and predict changes in the macrovasculature based on microvascular features 
      and function. In this review, we summarize the current state of the field in 
      using retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular issues and other diseases.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common consequences of diabetes. It 
      affects the retina, causing blood vessel damage which can lead to loss of vision. 
      Saving patients from losing their sight or at least slowing the progress of this 
      disease depends mainly on the early detection of this pathology, on top of the 
      detection of its specific stage. Furthermore, the early detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy and the follow-up of the patient's condition remains an arduous task, 
      whether for an experienced expert ophthalmologist or a computer-aided diagnosis 
      technician. In this paper, we aim to propose a new automatic diabetic retinopathy 
      severity level detection method. The proposed approach merges the pyramid 
      hierarchy of the discrete wavelet transform of the retina fundus image with the 
      modified capsule network and the modified inception block proposed, in addition 
      to a new deep hybrid model that concatenates the inception block with capsule 
      networks. The performance of our proposed approach has been validated on the 
      APTOS dataset, as it achieved a high training accuracy of 97.71% and a high 
      testing accuracy score of 86.54%, which is considered one of the best scores 
      achieved in this field using the same dataset.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease that victimize the people suffering 
      from diabetes from many years. The severe form of DR results in form of the 
      blindness that can initially be controlled by the DR-screening oriented 
      treatment. The effective screening programs require the trained human resource 
      that manually grade the fundus images to understand the severity of the disease. 
      But due to the complexity of this process, and the insufficient number of the 
      trained workers, the precise manual grading is an expensive process. The 
      CAD-based solutions try to address these limitations but most of the existing DR 
      detection systems are as evaluated over small sets and become ineffective when 
      applied in real scenarios. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a novel technique 
      to precisely detect the various stages of the DR by extending the research of the 
      content-based image retrieval domain. To achieve the human-level performance over 
      the large-scale DR-datasets (i.e. Kaggle-DR), the fundus images are represented 
      by the novel tetragonal local octa pattern (T-LOP) features, that are then 
      classified through the extreme learning machine (ELM). To justify the 
      significance of the method, the proposed scheme is compared against several 
      state-of-the-art methods including the deep learning-based methods over four 
      DR-datasets of variational lengths (i.e. Kaggle-DR, DRIVE, Review-DB, STARE). The 
      experimental results confirm the significance of the DR-detection scheme to serve 
      as a stand-alone solution for providing the precise information of the severity 
      of the DR in an efficient manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy has become 
      a popular research focus in the past decade. However, no scientometric report has 
      provided a systematic overview of this scientific area. AIMS: We utilized a 
      bibliometric approach to identify and analyse the academic literature on 
      artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy and explore emerging research 
      trends, key authors, co-authorship networks, institutions, countries, and 
      journals. We further captured the diabetic retinopathy conditions and technology 
      commonly used within this area. METHODS: Web of Science was used to collect 
      relevant articles on artificial intelligence use in diabetic retinopathy 
      published between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2022 . All the retrieved 
      titles were screened for eligibility, with one criterion that they must be in 
      English. All the bibliographic information was extracted and used to perform a 
      descriptive analysis. Bibliometrix (R tool) and VOSviewer (Leiden University) 
      were used to construct and visualize the annual numbers of publications, 
      journals, authors, countries, institutions, collaboration networks, keywords, and 
      references. RESULTS: In total, 931 articles that met the criteria were collected. 
      The number of annual publications showed an increasing trend over the last ten 
      years. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science (58/931), IEEE Access 
      (54/931), and Computers in Biology and Medicine (23/931) were the most journals 
      with most publications. China (211/931), India (143/931, USA (133/931), and South 
      Korea (44/931) were the most productive countries of origin. The National 
      University of Singapore (40/931), Singapore Eye Research Institute (35/931), and 
      Johns Hopkins University (34/931) were the most productive institutions. Ting D. 
      (34/931), Wong T. (28/931), and Tan G. (17/931) were the most productive 
      researchers. CONCLUSION: This study summarizes the recent advances in artificial 
      intelligence technology on diabetic retinopathy research and sheds light on the 
      emerging trends, sources, leading institutions, and hot topics through 
      bibliometric analysis and network visualization. Although this field has already 
      shown great potential in health care, our findings will provide valuable clues 
      relevant to future research directions and clinical practice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to provide unparalleled value in a 
      myriad of industries and applications. In recent years, researchers have 
      harnessed artificial intelligence to analyze large-volume, unstructured medical 
      data and perform clinical tasks, such as the identification of diabetic 
      retinopathy or the diagnosis of cutaneous malignancies. Applications of 
      artificial intelligence techniques, specifically machine learning and more 
      recently deep learning, are beginning to emerge in gastrointestinal endoscopy. 
      The most promising of these efforts have been in computer-aided detection and 
      computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal polyps, with recent systems demonstrating 
      high sensitivity and accuracy even when compared to expert human endoscopists. AI 
      has also been utilized to identify gastrointestinal bleeding, to detect areas of 
      inflammation, and even to diagnose certain gastrointestinal infections. Future 
      work in the field should concentrate on creating seamless integration of AI 
      systems with current endoscopy platforms and electronic medical records, 
      developing training modules to teach clinicians how to use AI tools, and 
      determining the best means for regulation and approval of new AI technology.

AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated using ultrawide-field fundus images with a deep 
      convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a machine learning technology, to 
      detect treatment-naïve proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS: We 
      conducted training with the DCNN using 378 photographic images (132 PDR and 246 
      non-PDR) and constructed a deep learning model. The area under the curve (AUC), 
      sensitivity, and specificity were examined. RESULT: The constructed deep learning 
      model demonstrated a high sensitivity of 94.7% and a high specificity of 97.2%, 
      with an AUC of 0.969. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that PDR could be 
      diagnosed using wide-angle camera images and deep learning.

      Learning Algorithms in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening.
LID - 10.3390/life12101610 [doi]
LID - 1610
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of regional 
      graders and artificial intelligence algorithms across retinal cameras with 
      different specifications in classifying an image as gradable and ungradable. 
      Methods: Study subjects were included from a community-based nationwide diabetic 
      retinopathy screening program in Thailand. Various non-mydriatic fundus cameras 
      were used for image acquisition, including Kowa Nonmyd, Kowa Nonmyd α-DⅢ, Kowa 
      Nonmyd 7, Kowa Nonmyd WX, Kowa VX 10 α, Kowa VX 20 and Nidek AFC 210. All retinal 
      photographs were graded by deep learning algorithms and human graders and 
      compared with a standard reference. Results: Images were divided into two 
      categories as gradable and ungradable images. Four thousand eight hundred 
      fifty-two participants with 19,408 fundus images were included, of which 15,351 
      (79.09%) were gradable images and the remaining 4057 (20.90%) were ungradable 
      images. Conclusions: The deep learning (DL) algorithm demonstrated better 
      sensitivity, specificity and kappa than the human graders for all eight types of 
      non-mydriatic fundus cameras. The deep learning system showed, more consistent 
      diagnostic performance than the human graders across images of varying quality 
      and camera types.

AB  - The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning provided 
      precise image recognition and classification in the medical field. Ophthalmology 
      is an exceptional department to translate AI applications since noninvasive 
      imaging is routinely used for the diagnosis and monitoring. In recent years, 
      AI-based image interpretation of optical coherence tomography and fundus 
      photograph in retinal diseases has been extended to diabetic retinopathy, 
      age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. The rapid 
      development of portable ocular monitoring devices coupled with AI-informed 
      interpretations allows possible home monitoring or remote monitoring of retinal 
      diseases and patients to gain autonomy and responsibility for their conditions. 
      This review discusses the current research and application of AI, telemedicine, 
      and home monitoring devices on retinal disease. Furthermore, we propose a future 
      model of how AI and digital technology could be implemented in retinal diseases.

AB  - At medical checkups or mass screenings, the fundus examination is effective for 
      early detection of systemic hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, 
      etc. In most cases, ophthalmologists and physicians grade retinal images by the 
      condition of the blood vessels, lesions. However, human observation does not 
      provide quantitative results, thus blood vessel analysis is an important process 
      in determining hypertension and arteriosclerosis, quantitatively. This chapter 
      describes the latest automated blood vessel extraction using the deep convolution 
      neural network (DCNN). Diabetic retinopathy is a common cardiovascular disease 
      and a major factor in blindness. Therefore, early detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy is very important to preventing blindness. A microaneurysm is an 
      initial sign of diabetic retinopathy, and much research has been conducted for 
      microaneurysm detection. This chapter also describes diabetic retinopathy 
      detection and automated microaneurysm detection using the DCNN.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is a multidisciplinary field with the aim of building 
      platforms that can make machines act, perceive, reason intelligently and whose 
      goal is to automate activities that presently require human intelligence. From 
      the cornea to the retina, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to help 
      ophthalmologists diagnose and treat ocular diseases. In ophthalmology, 
      computerized analytics are being viewed as efficient and more objective ways to 
      interpret the series of images and come to a conclusion. AI can be used to 
      diagnose and grade diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular 
      degeneration, cataracts, IOL power calculation, retinopathy of prematurity and 
      keratoconus. This review article intends to discuss various aspects of artificial 
      intelligence in ophthalmology.

TI  - Performance of a Machine-Learning Computational Image Analysis Algorithm in 
      Retinal Fluid Quantification for Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema and Retinal 
      Vein Occlusions.
PG  - 123-131
LID - 10.3928/23258160-20220215-02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective is to validate an automated artificial 
      intelligence model in detecting and quantifying fluid in diabetic macular edema 
      (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) optical coherence tomography images. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: DME (n = 100) and RVO (n = 100) images of adult patients 
      were reviewed. The performance of machine-learning (ML) computational image 
      analysis algorithm was evaluated against consensus manual grading. Main outcomes 
      were accuracy and sensitivity for detection and Pearson's correlation 
      coefficients for quantification. RESULTS: The ML algorithm had a high accuracy 
      and sensitivity in both DME (intraretinal fluid [IRF]: 0.92, 0.97; subretinal 
      fluid [SRF]: 0.93, 1.00) and RVO (IRF: 0.94, 0.99; SRF: 0.93, 1.00). It had 
      moderate-high correlation in quantifying fluid in DME (total retinal fluid: 0.88; 
      IRF: 0.88; SRF: 0.97) and RVO (total retinal fluid: 0.83; IRF: 0.76; SRF: 0.64). 
      CONCLUSION: The ML algorithm is highly accurate and sensitive in detecting fluid 
      in DME and RVO optical coherence tomography images and effectively quantifies IRF 
      and SRF in both disease states, particularly in images with low to moderate fluid 
      burden. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2022;53:123-131.].

AB  - PURPOSE: To propose a deep-learning-based method to differentiate arteries from 
      veins in montaged widefield OCT angiography (OCTA). DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 232 participants, including 109 participants with 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), 64 participants with branch retinal vein occlusion 
      (BRVO), 27 participants with diabetes but without DR, and 32 healthy 
      participants. METHODS: We propose a convolutional neural network (CAVnet) to 
      classify retinal blood vessels on montaged widefield OCTA en face images as 
      arteries and veins. A total of 240 retinal angiograms from 88 eyes were used to 
      train CAVnet, and 302 retinal angiograms from 144 eyes were used for testing. 
      This method takes the OCTA images as input and outputs the segmentation results 
      with arteries and veins down to the level of precapillary arterioles and 
      postcapillary venules. The network also identifies their intersections. We 
      evaluated the agreement (in pixels) between segmentation results and the manually 
      graded ground truth using sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and Intersection 
      over Union (IoU). Measurements of arterial and venous caliber or tortuosity are 
      made on our algorithm's output of healthy and diseased eyes. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Classification of arteries and veins, arterial and venous caliber, and 
      arterial and venous tortuosity. RESULTS: For classification and identification of 
      arteries, the algorithm achieved average sensitivity of 95.3%, specificity of 
      99.6%, F1 score of 94.2%, and IoU of 89.3%. For veins, the algorithm achieved 
      average sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 99.7%, F1 score of 94.1%, and IoU of 
      89.2%. We also achieved an average sensitivity of 76.3% in identifying 
      intersection points. The results show CAVnet has high accuracy on differentiating 
      arteries and veins in DR and BRVO cases. These classification results are robust 
      across 2 instruments and multiple scan volume sizes. Outputs of CAVnet were used 
      to measure arterial and venous caliber or tortuosity, and pixel-wise caliber and 
      tortuosity maps were generated. Differences between healthy and diseased eyes 
      were demonstrated, indicating potential clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: The CAVnet 
      can classify arteries and veins and their branches with high accuracy and is 
      potentially useful in the analysis of vessel type-specific features on diseases 
      such as branch retinal artery occlusion and BRVO.

TI  - Dynamic Graph Clustering Learning for Unsupervised Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Classification.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13203251 [doi]
LID - 3251
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes, which can lead to 
      vision loss. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the progression of DR. In 
      recent years, deep learning approaches have shown promising results in the 
      development of an intelligent and efficient system for DR classification. 
      However, one major drawback is the need for expert-annotated datasets, which are 
      both time-consuming and costly. To address these challenges, this paper proposes 
      a novel dynamic graph clustering learning (DGCL) method for unsupervised 
      classification of DR, which innovatively deploys the Euclidean and topological 
      features from fundus images for dynamic clustering. Firstly, a multi-structural 
      feature fusion (MFF) module extracts features from the structure of the fundus 
      image and captures topological relationships among multiple samples, generating a 
      fused representation. Secondly, another consistency smoothing clustering (CSC) 
      module combines network updates and deep clustering to ensure stability and 
      smooth performance improvement during model convergence, optimizing the 
      clustering process by iteratively updating the network and refining the 
      clustering results. Lastly, dynamic memory storage is utilized to track and store 
      important information from previous iterations, enhancing the training stability 
      and convergence. During validation, the experimental results with public datasets 
      demonstrated the superiority of our proposed DGCL network.

TI  - Variability in Grading Diabetic Retinopathy Using Retinal Photography and Its 
      Comparison with an Automated Deep Learning Diabetic Retinopathy Screening 
      Software.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11121697 [doi]
LID - 1697
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening using colour retinal photographs 
      is cost-effective and time-efficient. In real-world clinical settings, DR 
      severity is frequently graded by individuals of different expertise levels. We 
      aim to determine the agreement in DR severity grading between human graders of 
      varying expertise and an automated deep learning DR screening software (ADLS). 
      METHODS: Using the International Clinical DR Disease Severity Scale, two hundred 
      macula-centred fundus photographs were graded by retinal specialists, 
      ophthalmology residents, family medicine physicians, medical students, and the 
      ADLS. Based on referral urgency, referral grading was divided into no referral, 
      non-urgent referral, and urgent referral to an ophthalmologist. Inter-observer 
      and intra-group variations were analysed using Gwet's agreement coefficient, and 
      the performance of ADLS was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: 
      The agreement coefficient for inter-observer and intra-group variability ranged 
      from fair to very good, and moderate to good, respectively. The ADLS showed a 
      high area under curve of 0.879, 0.714, and 0.836 for non-referable DR, non-urgent 
      referable DR, and urgent referable DR, respectively, with varying sensitivity and 
      specificity values. CONCLUSION: Inter-observer and intra-group agreements among 
      human graders vary widely, but ADLS is a reliable and reasonably sensitive tool 
      for mass screening to detect referable DR and urgent referable DR.

AB  - Ophthalmology is one of the major imaging-intensive fields of medicine and thus 
      has potential for extensive applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to 
      advance diagnosis, drug efficacy, and other treatment-related aspects of ocular 
      disease. AI has made impressive progress in ophthalmology within the past few 
      years and two autonomous AI-enabled systems have received US regulatory approvals 
      for autonomously screening for mid-level or advanced diabetic retinopathy and 
      macular edema. While no autonomous AI-enabled system for glaucoma screening has 
      yet received US regulatory approval, numerous assistive AI-enabled software tools 
      are already employed in commercialized instruments for quantifying retinal images 
      and visual fields to augment glaucoma research and clinical practice. In this 
      literature review (non-systematic), we provide an overview of AI applications in 
      glaucoma, and highlight some limitations and considerations for AI integration 
      and adoption into clinical practice.

TI  - Systematic Comparison of Heatmapping Techniques in Deep Learning in the Context 
      of Diabetic Retinopathy Lesion Detection.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1167/tvst.9.2.64 [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - PURPOSE: Heatmapping techniques can support explainability of deep learning (DL) 
      predictions in medical image analysis. However, individual techniques have been 
      mainly applied in a descriptive way without an objective and systematic 
      evaluation. We investigated comparative performances using diabetic retinopathy 
      lesion detection as a benchmark task. METHODS: The Indian Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Image Dataset (IDRiD) publicly available database contains fundus images of 
      diabetes patients with pixel level annotations of diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      lesions, the ground truth for this study. Three in advance trained DL models 
      (ResNet50, VGG16 or InceptionV3) were used for DR detection in these images. 
      Next, explainability was visualized with each of the 10 most used heatmapping 
      techniques. The quantitative correspondence between the output of a heatmap and 
      the ground truth was evaluated with the Explainability Consistency Score (ECS), a 
      metric between 0 and 1, developed for this comparative task. RESULTS: In case of 
      the overall DR lesions detection, the ECS ranged from 0.21 to 0.51 for all 
      model/heatmapping combinations. The highest score was for VGG16+Grad-CAM (ECS = 
      0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.46; 0.55]). For individual lesions, 
      VGG16+Grad-CAM performed best on hemorrhages and hard exudates. 
      ResNet50+SmoothGrad performed best for soft exudates and ResNet50+Guided 
      Backpropagation performed best for microaneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: Our empirical 
      evaluation on the IDRiD database demonstrated that the combination DL 
      model/heatmapping affects explainability when considering common DR lesions. Our 
      approach found considerable disagreement between regions highlighted by heatmaps 
      and expert annotations. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We warrant a more systematic 
      investigation and analysis of heatmaps for reliable explanation of image-based 
      predictions of deep learning models.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become one of the major causes of blindness. Due to 
      the increased prevalence of diabetes worldwide, diabetic patients exhibit high 
      probabilities of developing DR. There is a need to develop a labor-less 
      computer-aided diagnosis system to support the clinical diagnosis. Here, we 
      attempted to develop simple methods for severity grading and lesion detection 
      from retinal fundus images. We developed a severity grading system for DR by 
      transfer learning with a recent convolutional neural network called 
      EfficientNet-B3 and the publicly available Kaggle Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology 
      Society (APTOS) 2019 training dataset, which includes artificial noise. After 
      removing the blurred and duplicated images from the dataset using a numerical 
      threshold, the trained model achieved specificity and sensitivity values ≳ 0.98 
      in the identification of DR retinas. For severity grading, the classification 
      accuracy values of 0.84, 0.95, and 0.98 were recorded for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
      predicted labels, respectively. The utility of EfficientNets-B3 for the severity 
      grading of DR as well as the detailed retinal areas referred were confirmed via 
      visual explanation methods of convolutional neural networks. Lesion extraction 
      was performed by applying an empirically defined threshold value to the enhanced 
      retinal images. Although the extraction of blood vessels and detection of red 
      lesions occurred simultaneously, the red and white lesions, including both soft 
      and hard exudates, were clearly extracted. The detected lesion areas were further 
      confirmed with ground truth using the DIARETDB1 database images with general 
      accuracy. The simple and easily applicable methods proposed in this study will 
      aid in the detection and severity grading of DR, which might help in the 
      selection of appropriate treatment strategies for DR.

AB  - In this study, we propose an ensemble model for the detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) illness that is driven by transfer learning. Due to diabetes, 
      the DR is a problem that affects the eyes. The retinal blood vessels in a person 
      with high blood sugar deteriorate. The blood arteries may enlarge and leak as a 
      result, or they may close and stop the flow of blood. If DR is not treated, it 
      can become severe, damage vision, and eventually result in blindness. Medical 
      experts study the colored fundus photos for this reason in order to manually 
      diagnose disease, however this is a perilous technique. As a result, the 
      condition was automatically identified utilizing retinal scans and a number of 
      computer vision-based methods. A model is trained on one task or datasets 
      employing the transfer learning (TL) technique, and then the pre-trained models 
      or weights are applied to another task or dataset. Six deep learning (DL)-based 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained in this study using huge 
      datasets of reasonable photos, including DenseNet-169, VGG-19, ResNet101-V2, 
      Mobilenet-V2, and Inception-V3. We also applied a data-preprocessing strategy to 
      improve the accuracy and lower the training costs in order to improve the 
      results. The experimental results demonstrate that the suggested model works 
      better than existing approaches on the same dataset, with an accuracy of up to 
      98%, and detects the stage of DR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical measures are required to identify and reduce blindness due to 
      diabetes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Therefore, we 
      evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep 
      learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in 
      Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: We adopted an ensemble AI model 
      consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted 
      VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying 
      retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus 
      images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore 
      Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been 
      published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients 
      with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban 
      centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our 
      model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. 
      Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and 
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), 
      sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and 
      sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular 
      oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate 
      analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI 
      and human graders. FINDINGS: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes 
      of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic 
      retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. 
      The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 
      0·969-0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10-94·12) and 
      specificity of 89·04% (87·85-90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy 
      sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15-99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 
      97·19% (96·61-97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in 
      referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors 
      associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of 
      diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood 
      pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. 
      INTERPRETATION: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting 
      referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and 
      diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This 
      shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an 
      under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable 
      blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population. FUNDING:

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the feasibility of using deep learning for optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA) detection of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: A 
      deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG16, was 
      employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to retrain 
      the CNN for robust OCTA classification. One dataset, consisting of images of 32 
      healthy eyes, 75 eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 24 eyes with diabetes 
      but no DR (NoDR), was used for training and cross-validation. A second dataset 
      consisting of 20 NoDR and 26 DR eyes was used for external validation. To 
      demonstrate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR 
      in clinical environments, the CNN was incorporated into a graphical user 
      interface (GUI) platform. RESULTS: With the last nine layers retrained, the CNN 
      architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The 
      cross-validation accuracy of the retrained classifier for differentiating among 
      healthy, NoDR, and DR eyes was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% 
      specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR, and DR 
      eyes were 0.97, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The GUI platform enabled easy 
      validation of the method for AI screening of DR in a clinical environment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With a transfer learning process for retraining, a CNN can be used 
      for robust OCTA classification of healthy, NoDR, and DR eyes. The AI-based OCTA 
      classification platform may provide a practical solution to reducing the burden 
      of experienced ophthalmologists with regard to mass screening of DR patients. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Deep-learning-based OCTA classification can alleviate 
      the need for manual graders and improve DR screening efficiency.

AB  - In diabetic retinopathy (DR), the early signs that may lead the eyesight towards 
      complete vision loss are considered as microaneurysms (MAs). The shape of these 
      MAs is almost circular, and they have a darkish color and are tiny in size, which 
      means they may be missed by manual analysis of ophthalmologists. In this case, 
      accurate early detection of microaneurysms is helpful to cure DR before 
      non-reversible blindness. In the proposed method, early detection of MAs is 
      performed using a hybrid feature embedding approach of pre-trained CNN models, 
      named as VGG-19 and Inception-v3. The performance of the proposed approach was 
      evaluated using publicly available datasets, namely "E-Ophtha" and "DIARETDB1", 
      and achieved 96% and 94% classification accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      developed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of 
      sensitivity and specificity for microaneurysms detection.

AB  - Deep learning is quickly becoming the leading methodology for medical image 
      analysis. Given a large medical archive, where each image is associated with a 
      diagnosis, efficient pathology detectors or classifiers can be trained with 
      virtually no expert knowledge about the target pathologies. However, deep 
      learning algorithms, including the popular ConvNets, are black boxes: little is 
      known about the local patterns analyzed by ConvNets to make a decision at the 
      image level. A solution is proposed in this paper to create heatmaps showing 
      which pixels in images play a role in the image-level predictions. In other 
      words, a ConvNet trained for image-level classification can be used to detect 
      lesions as well. A generalization of the backpropagation method is proposed in 
      order to train ConvNets that produce high-quality heatmaps. The proposed solution 
      is applied to diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in a dataset of almost 90,000 
      fundus photographs from the 2015 Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy competition and a 
      private dataset of almost 110,000 photographs (e-ophtha). For the task of 
      detecting referable DR, very good detection performance was achieved: A(z)=0.954 
      in Kaggle's dataset and A(z)=0.949 in e-ophtha. Performance was also evaluated at 
      the image level and at the lesion level in the DiaretDB1 dataset, where four 
      types of lesions are manually segmented: microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates 
      and cotton-wool spots. For the task of detecting images containing these four 
      lesion types, the proposed detector, which was trained to detect referable DR, 
      outperforms recent algorithms trained to detect those lesions specifically, with 
      pixel-level supervision. At the lesion level, the proposed detector outperforms 
      heatmap generation algorithms for ConvNets. This detector is part of the 
      Messidor® system for mobile eye pathology screening. Because it does not rely on 
      expert knowledge or manual segmentation for detecting relevant patterns, the 
      proposed solution is a promising image mining tool, which has the potential to 
      discover new biomarkers in images.

TI  - Deep Learning to Detect OCT-derived Diabetic Macular Edema from Color Retinal

AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the generalizability of a deep learning system (DLS) that 
      detects diabetic macular edema (DME) from 2-dimensional color fundus photographs 
      (CFP), for which the reference standard for retinal thickness and fluid presence 
      is derived from 3-dimensional OCT. DESIGN: Retrospective validation of a DLS 
      across international datasets. PARTICIPANTS: Paired CFP and OCT of patients from 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs or retina clinics. The DLS was 
      developed using data sets from Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United 
      States and validated using 3060 unique eyes from 1582 patients across screening 
      populations in Australia, India, and Thailand. The DLS was separately validated 
      in 698 eyes from 537 screened patients in the United Kingdom with mild DR and 
      suspicion of DME based on CFP. METHODS: The DLS was trained using DME labels from 
      OCT. The presence of DME was based on retinal thickening or intraretinal fluid. 
      The DLS's performance was compared with expert grades of maculopathy and to a 
      previous proof-of-concept version of the DLS. We further simulated the 
      integration of the current DLS into an algorithm trained to detect DR from CFP. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The superiority of specificity and noninferiority of 
      sensitivity of the DLS for the detection of center-involving DME, using 
      device-specific thresholds, compared with experts. RESULTS: The primary analysis 
      in a combined data set spanning Australia, India, and Thailand showed the DLS had 
      80% specificity and 81% sensitivity, compared with expert graders, who had 59% 
      specificity and 70% sensitivity. Relative to human experts, the DLS had 
      significantly higher specificity (P = 0.008) and noninferior sensitivity (P < 
      0.001). In the data set from the United Kingdom, the DLS had a specificity of 80% 
      (P < 0.001 for specificity of >50%) and a sensitivity of 100% (P = 0.02 for 
      sensitivity of > 90%). CONCLUSIONS: The DLS can generalize to multiple 
      international populations with an accuracy exceeding that of experts. The 
      clinical value of this DLS to reduce false-positive referrals, thus decreasing 
      the burden on specialist eye care, warrants a prospective evaluation.

PG  - 105-109
LID - 10.5312/wjo.v15.i2.105 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning are becoming increasingly powerful 
      tools in diagnostic and radiographic medicine. Deep learning has already been 
      utilized for automated detection of pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic 
      retinopathy, breast cancer, skin carcinoma classification, and metastatic 
      lymphadenopathy detection, with diagnostic reliability akin to medical experts. 
      In the World Journal of Orthopedics article, the authors apply an automated and 
      AI-assisted technique to determine the hallux valgus angle (HVA) for assessing HV 
      foot deformity. With the U-net neural network, the authors constructed an 
      algorithm for pattern recognition of HV foot deformity from anteroposterior 
      high-resolution radiographs. The performance of the deep learning algorithm was 
      compared to expert clinician manual performance and assessed alongside 
      clinician-clinician variability. The authors found that the AI tool was 
      sufficient in assessing HVA and proposed the system as an instrument to augment 
      clinical efficiency. Though further sophistication is needed to establish 
      automated algorithms for more complicated foot pathologies, this work adds to the 
      growing evidence supporting AI as a powerful diagnostic tool.

AB  - Retinal illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) are the main causes of vision 
      loss. In the early recognition of eye diseases, the segmentation of blood vessels 
      in retina images plays an important role. Different symptoms of ocular diseases 
      can be identified by the geometric features of ocular arteries. However, due to 
      the complex construction of the blood vessels and their different thicknesses, 
      segmenting the retina image is a challenging task. There are a number of 
      algorithms that helped the detection of retinal diseases. This paper presents an 
      overview of papers from 2016 to 2022 that discuss machine learning and deep 
      learning methods for automatic vessel segmentation. The methods are divided into 
      two groups: Deep learning-based, and classic methods. Algorithms, classifiers, 
      pre-processing and specific techniques of each group is described, 
      comprehensively. The performances of recent works are compared based on their 
      achieved accuracy in different datasets in inclusive tables. A survey of most 
      popular datasets like DRIVE, STARE, HRF and CHASE_DB1 is also given in this 
      paper. Finally, a list of findings from this review is presented in the 
      conclusion section.

AB  - With the rapid development of computer technology, the application of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in ophthalmology research has gained prominence in modern 
      medicine. Artificial intelligence-related research in ophthalmology previously 
      focused on the screening and diagnosis of fundus diseases, particularly diabetic 
      retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Since fundus images 
      are relatively fixed, their standards are easy to unify. Artificial intelligence 
      research related to ocular surface diseases has also increased. The main issue 
      with research on ocular surface diseases is that the images involved are complex, 
      with many modalities. Therefore, this review aims to summarize current artificial 
      intelligence research and technologies used to diagnose ocular surface diseases 
      such as pterygium, keratoconus, infectious keratitis, and dry eye to identify 
      mature artificial intelligence models that are suitable for research of ocular 
      surface diseases and potential algorithms that may be used in the future.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computer-algorithms in 
      analyzing complex medical data to detect associations and provide diagnostic 
      support outputs. AI and deep learning (DL) find obvious applications in fields 
      like ophthalmology wherein huge amount of image-based data need to be analyzed; 
      however, the outcomes related to image recognition are reasonably well-defined. 
      AI and DL have found important roles in ophthalmology in early screening and 
      detection of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular 
      degeneration (ARMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), glaucoma, and other ocular 
      disorders, being successful inroads as far as early screening and diagnosis are 
      concerned and appear promising with advantages of high-screening accuracy, 
      consistency, and scalability. AI algorithms need equally skilled manpower, 
      trained optometrists/ophthalmologists (annotators) to provide accurate ground 
      truth for training the images. The basis of diagnoses made by AI algorithms is 
      mechanical, and some amount of human intervention is necessary for further 
      interpretations. This review was conducted after tracing the history of AI in 
      ophthalmology across multiple research databases and aims to summarise the 
      journey of AI in ophthalmology so far, making a close observation of most of the 
      crucial studies conducted. This article further aims to highlight the potential 
      impact of AI in ophthalmology, the pitfalls, and how to optimally use it to the 
      maximum benefits of the ophthalmologists, the healthcare systems and the 
      patients, alike.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and train a deep learning-based algorithm for detecting 
      disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL) on optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) to screen a cohort of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: In 
      this cross-sectional study, subjects over age 18, with ICD-9/10 diagnoses of type 
      2 diabetes with and without retinopathy and Cirrus HD-OCT imaging performed 
      between January 2009 to September 2019 were included in this study. After 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a final total of 664 patients 
      (5992 B-scans from 1201 eyes) were included for analysis. Five-line horizontal 
      raster scans from Cirrus HD-OCT were obtained from the shared electronic health 
      record. Two trained graders evaluated scans for presence of DRIL. A third 
      physician grader arbitrated any disagreements. Of 5992 B-scans analyzed, 1397 
      scans (∼30%) demonstrated presence of DRIL. Graded scans were used to label 
      training data for the convolution neural network (CNN) development and training. 
      RESULTS: On a single CPU system, the best performing CNN training took ∼35 mins. 
      Labeled data were divided 90:10 for internal training/validation and external 
      testing purpose. With this training, our deep learning network was able to 
      predict the presence of DRIL in new OCT scans with a high accuracy of 88.3%, 
      specificity of 90.0%, sensitivity of 82.9%, and Matthews correlation coefficient 
      of 0.7. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that a deep learning-based 
      OCT classification algorithm can be used for rapid automated identification of 
      DRIL. This developed tool can assist in screening for DRIL in both research and 
      clinical decision-making settings. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: A deep learning 
      algorithm can detect disorganization of retinal inner layers in OCT scans.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved over the last few years; its use in DR 
      screening has been demonstrated in multiple evidences across the globe. However, 
      there are concerns right from the data acquisition, bias in data, difficulty in 
      comparing between different algorithm, challenges in machine learning, its 
      application in different group of population, and human barrier to AI adoption in 
      health care. There are also legal and ethical concerns related to AI. The tension 
      between risks and concerns on one hand versus potential and opportunity on the 
      other have driven a need for authorities to implement policies for AI in DR 
      screening to address these issues. The policy makers should support and 
      facilitate research and development of AI in healthcare, but at the same time, it 
      has to be ensured that the use of AI in healthcare aligns with recognized 
      standards of safety, efficacy, and equity. It is essential to ensure that 
      algorithms, datasets, and decisions are auditable and when applied to medical 
      care (such as screening, diagnosis, or treatment) are clinically validated and 
      explainable. Policy frameworks should require design of AI systems in health care 
      that are informed by real-world workflow and human-centric design. Lastly, it 
      should be ensured that healthcare AI solutions align with all relevant ethical 
      obligations, from design to development to use and to be delivered properly in 
      the real world.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning framework that allows remote 
      clients to collaboratively learn a global model while keeping their training data 
      localized. It has emerged as an effective tool to solve the problem of data 
      privacy protection. In particular, in the medical field, it is gaining relevance 
      for achieving collaborative learning while protecting sensitive data. In this 
      work, we demonstrate the feasibility of FL in the development of a deep learning 
      model for screening diabetic retinopathy (DR) in fundus photographs. To this end, 
      we conduct a simulated FL framework using nearly 700,000 fundus photographs 
      collected from OPHDIAT, a French multi-center screening network for detecting DR. 
      We develop two FL algorithms: 1) a cross-center FL algorithm using data 
      distributed across the OPHDIAT centers and 2) a cross-grader FL algorithm using 
      data distributed across the OPHDIAT graders. We explore and assess different FL 
      strategies and compare them to a conventional learning algorithm, namely 
      centralized learning (CL), where all the data is stored in a centralized 
      repository. For the task of referable DR detection, our simulated FL algorithms 
      achieved similar performance to CL, in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC): 
      AUC =0.9482 for CL, AUC = 0.9317 for cross-center FL and AUC = 0.9522 for 
      cross-grader FL. Our work indicates that the FL algorithm is a viable and 
      reliable framework that can be applied in a screening network.Clinical relevance- 
      Given that data sharing is regarded as an essential component of modern medical 
      research, achieving collaborative learning while protecting sensitive data is 
      key.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the main retinal vascular complication of 
      DM, is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age 
      people worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference of 
      plasma metabolic profiles in patients with DR to better understand the mechanism 
      of this disease and disease progression. METHODS: We used ultrahigh-performance 
      liquid Q-Exactive mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analyses to 
      conduct a comprehensive analysis of plasma metabolites in a population with DR 
      and proliferative DR (PDR). A risk score based on the level of the selected 
      metabolite was established and evaluated using the least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator regularization logistic regression (LASSO-LR) based machine 
      learning model. RESULTS: 22 differentially expressed metabolites which belonged 
      to different metabolic pathway were identified and confirmed to be associated 
      with the occurrence of DR. A risk score based on the level of the selected 
      metabolite pseudouridine was established and evaluated to strongly associated 
      with the occurrence of DR. Four circulating plasma metabolites (pseudouridine, 
      glutamate, leucylleucine and N-acetyltryptophan) were identified to be 
      differentially expressed between patients with PDR and other patients, and a risk 
      score formula based on these plasma metabolites was developed and assessed to be 
      significantly related to PDR. CONCLUSIONS: Our work highlights the possible use 
      of the risk score assessment based on the plasma metabolites not only reveal in 
      the early diagnosis of DR and PDR but also assist in enhancing current 
      therapeutic strategies in the clinic.

TI  - Comparing code-free and bespoke deep learning approaches in ophthalmology.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-024-06432-x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Code-free deep learning (CFDL) allows clinicians without coding expertise to 
      build high-quality artificial intelligence (AI) models without writing code. In 
      this review, we comprehensively review the advantages that CFDL offers over 
      bespoke expert-designed deep learning (DL). As exemplars, we use the following 
      tasks: (1) diabetic retinopathy screening, (2) retinal multi-disease 
      classification, (3) surgical video classification, (4) oculomics and (5) resource 
      management. METHODS: We performed a search for studies reporting CFDL 
      applications in ophthalmology in MEDLINE (through PubMed) from inception to June 
      25, 2023, using the keywords 'autoML' AND 'ophthalmology'. After identifying 5 
      CFDL studies looking at our target tasks, we performed a subsequent search to 
      find corresponding bespoke DL studies focused on the same tasks. Only 
      English-written articles with full text available were included. Reviews, 
      editorials, protocols and case reports or case series were excluded. We 
      identified ten relevant studies for this review. RESULTS: Overall, studies were 
      optimistic towards CFDL's advantages over bespoke DL in the five ophthalmological 
      tasks. However, much of such discussions were identified to be mono-dimensional 
      and had wide applicability gaps. High-quality assessment of better CFDL 
      applicability over bespoke DL warrants a context-specific, weighted assessment of 
      clinician intent, patient acceptance and cost-effectiveness. We conclude that 
      CFDL and bespoke DL are unique in their own assets and are irreplaceable with 
      each other. Their benefits are differentially valued on a case-to-case basis. 
      Future studies are warranted to perform a multidimensional analysis of both 
      techniques and to improve limitations of suboptimal dataset quality, poor 
      applicability implications and non-regulated study designs. CONCLUSION: For 
      clinicians without DL expertise and easy access to AI experts, CFDL allows the 
      prototyping of novel clinical AI systems. CFDL models concert with bespoke 
      models, depending on the task at hand. A multidimensional, weighted evaluation of 
      the factors involved in the implementation of those models for a designated task 
      is warranted.

TI  - The Importance of Close Follow-Up in Patients with Early-Grade Diabetic 
      Retinopathy: A Taiwan Population-Based Study Grading via Deep Learning Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189768 [doi]
LID - 9768
AB  - (1) Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) can cause blindness. Current guidelines 
      on diabetic eye care recommend more frequent eye examinations for more severe DR 
      to prevent deterioration. However, close follow-up and early intervention at 
      earlier stages are important for the prevention of disease progression of other 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. The study was designed to investigate the 
      association between different stages of DR in type 2 DM patients and the 
      progression of DR; (2) Methods: A total of 2623 type 2 DM patients were included 
      in this study. In these patients, a total of 14,409 fundus color photographs was 
      obtained. The primary outcome was the progression of DR; (3) Results: The 
      progression of DR was highly associated with the initial grade of DR (p < 0.001). 
      Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) was the most likely to 
      progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), followed by moderate NPDR, 
      mild NPDR, and no retinopathy. However, progression to the next stage of DR 
      showed a different trend. We used no retinopathy as a reference. Mild NPDR showed 
      the highest risk for progression to the next stage [hazard ratio (HR): 2.00 (95% 
      conference interval (CI): 1.72-2.32)] relative to higher initial grades [HR 
      (moderate NPDR): 1.82 (95% CI: 1.58-2.09) and HR (severe NPDR): 0.87 (95% CI: 
      0.69-1.09)]. The same trend was observed in the multivariate analysis, in which 
      mild NPDR presented the highest risk for progression to the next stage (adjusted 
      HR (mild NPDR): 1.95 (95% CI: 1.68-2.27), adjusted HR (moderate NPDR): 1.73 (95% 
      CI: 1.50-1.99), and adjusted HR (severe NPDR): 0.82 (95% CI: 0.65-1.03)); (4) 
      Conclusions: Type 2 diabetic patients with earlier-grade DR appeared to exhibit 
      more rapid development to the next grade in our study. As these findings show, 
      more frequent fundus color photography follow-up in earlier-grade DR patients is 
      important to slow DR progression and awaken self-perception.

TI  - Recent Advanced Deep Learning Architectures for Retinal Fluid Segmentation on 
      Optical Coherence Tomography Images.

AB  - With non-invasive and high-resolution properties, optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) has been widely used as a retinal imaging modality for the effective 
      diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. The retinal fluid is often segmented by medical 
      experts as a pivotal biomarker to assist in the clinical diagnosis of age-related 
      macular diseases, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion. In recent 
      years, the advanced machine learning methods, such as deep learning paradigms, 
      have attracted more and more attention from academia in the retinal fluid 
      segmentation applications. The automatic retinal fluid segmentation based on deep 
      learning can improve the semantic segmentation accuracy and efficiency of macular 
      change analysis, which has potential clinical implications for ophthalmic 
      pathology detection. This article summarizes several different deep learning 
      paradigms reported in the up-to-date literature for the retinal fluid 
      segmentation in OCT images. The deep learning architectures include the backbone 
      of convolutional neural network (CNN), fully convolutional network (FCN), U-shape 
      network (U-Net), and the other hybrid computational methods. The article also 
      provides a survey on the prevailing OCT image datasets used in recent retinal 
      segmentation investigations. The future perspectives and some potential retinal 
      segmentation directions are discussed in the concluding context.

TI  - A reliable diabetic retinopathy grading via transfer learning and ensemble 
      learning with quadratic weighted kappa metric.

AB  - The most common eye infection in people with diabetes is diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). It might cause blurred vision or even total blindness. Therefore, it is 
      essential to promote early detection to prevent or alleviate the impact of DR. 
      However, due to the possibility that symptoms may not be noticeable in the early 
      stages of DR, it is difficult for doctors to identify them. Therefore, numerous 
      predictive models based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been 
      developed to determine all stages of DR. However, existing DR classification 
      models cannot classify every DR stage or use a computationally heavy approach. 
      Common metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score 
      are not reliable for assessing DR grading. This is because they do not account 
      for two key factors: the severity of the discrepancy between the assigned and 
      predicted grades and the ordered nature of the DR grading scale. This research 
      proposes computationally efficient ensemble methods for the classification of DR. 
      These methods leverage pre-trained model weights, reducing training time and 
      resource requirements. In addition, data augmentation techniques are used to 
      address data limitations, improve features, and improve generalization. This 
      combination offers a promising approach for accurate and robust DR grading. In 
      particular, we take advantage of transfer learning using models trained on DR 
      data and employ CLAHE for image enhancement and Gaussian blur for noise 
      reduction. We propose a three-layer classifier that incorporates dropout and ReLU 
      activation. This design aims to minimize overfitting while effectively extracting 
      features and assigning DR grades. We prioritize the Quadratic Weighted Kappa 
      (QWK) metric due to its sensitivity to label discrepancies, which is crucial for 
      an accurate diagnosis of DR. This combined approach achieves state-of-the-art QWK 
      scores (0.901, 0.967 and 0.944) in the Eyepacs, Aptos, and Messidor datasets.

TI  - Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using Convolutional Neural Networks for Feature 
      Extraction and Classification (DRFEC).
PG  - 1-59
LID - 10.1007/s11042-022-14165-4 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is caused as a result of Diabetes Mellitus which causes 
      development of various retinal abrasions in the human retina. These lesions cause 
      hindrance in vision and in severe cases, DR can lead to blindness. DR is observed 
      amongst 80% of patients who have been diagnosed from prolonged diabetes for a 
      period of 10-15 years. The manual process of periodic DR diagnosis and detection 
      for necessary treatment, is time consuming and unreliable due to unavailability 
      of resources and expert opinion. Therefore, computerized diagnostic systems which 
      use Deep Learning (DL) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, are 
      proposed to learn DR patterns from fundus images and identify the severity of the 
      disease. This paper proposes a comprehensive model using 26 state-of-the-art DL 
      networks to assess and evaluate their performance, and which contribute for deep 
      feature extraction and image classification of DR fundus images. In the proposed 
      model, ResNet50 has shown highest overfitting in comparison to Inception V3, 
      which has shown lowest overfitting when trained using the Kaggle's EyePACS fundus 
      image dataset. EfficientNetB4 is the most optimal, efficient and reliable DL 
      algorithm in detection of DR, followed by InceptionResNetV2, NasNetLarge and 
      DenseNet169. EfficientNetB4 has achieved a training accuracy of 99.37% and the 
      highest validation accuracy of 79.11%. DenseNet201 has achieved the highest 
      training accuracy of 99.58% and a validation accuracy of 76.80% which is less 
      than the top-4 best performing models.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global visual indicator of diabetes that leads to 
      blindness and loss of vision. Manual testing presents a more difficult task when 
      attempting to detect DR due to the complexity and variances of DR. Early 
      detection and treatment prevent the diabetic patients from visual loss. Also 
      classifying the intensity and levels of DR is crucial to provide necessary 
      treatment. This study develops a novel deep learning (DL) approach called He 
      Weighted Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory (HWBLSTM) with an effective 
      transfer learning technique for detecting DR from the RFI. The collected fundus 
      images initially undergo preprocessing to improve their quality, which includes 
      noise removal and contrast enhancement using a Hybrid Gaussian Filter and 
      probability density Function-based Gamma Correction (HGFPDFGC) technique. The 
      segmentation procedure divides the image into subgroups and is crucial for 
      accurate detection and classification. The segmentation of the study initially 
      removes the optical disk (OD) and blood vessels (BVs) from the preprocessed 
      images using mathematical morphological operations. Next, it segments the retinal 
      lesions from the OD and BV removed images using the Enhanced Grasshopper 
      Optimization-based Region Growing Algorithm (EGORGA). Then, the features from the 
      segmented retinal lesions are learned using a Squeeze Net (SQN), and the 
      dimensionality reduction of the extracted features is done using the Modified 
      Singular Value Decomposition (MSVD) approach. Finally, the classification is 
      performed by employing the HWBLSTM approach, which classifies the DR 
      abnormalities in datasets as non-DR (NDR), non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate 
      NPDR (MDNPDR), and severe DR, also known as proliferative DR (PDR). The proposed 
      approach is implemented on APTOS as well as MESSIDOR datasets. The outcomes 
      proved that the proposed technique accurately identifies the DR with minimal 
      computation overhead compared to the existing approaches.Communicated by

PG  - 80

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Machine learning approaches-which seek to predict outcomes or 
      classify patient features by recognizing patterns in large datasets-are 
      increasingly applied to clinical epidemiology research on diabetes. Given its 
      novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning 
      terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes 
      researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an 
      approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes 
      published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020. RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning 
      approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide 
      clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than 
      traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches 
      using neural networking and "deep learning" can be applied to medical image data, 
      particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin 
      ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified 
      new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older 
      and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating 
      underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine 
      learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk 
      stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. 
      Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source 
      datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies 
      to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions.

TI  - Deep learning-based signal-independent assessment of macular avascular area on 
      6×6 mm optical coherence tomography angiogram in diabetic retinopathy: a 
      comparison to instrument-embedded software.
PG  - 84-89
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-318646 [doi]
AB  - SYNOPSIS: A deep-learning-based macular extrafoveal avascular area (EAA) on a 
      6×6 mm optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiogram is less dependent on the 
      signal strength and shadow artefacts, providing better diagnostic accuracy for 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity than the commercial software measured 
      extrafoveal vessel density (EVD). AIMS: To compare a deep-learning-based EAA to 
      commercial output EVD in the diagnostic accuracy of determining DR severity 
      levels from 6×6 mm OCT angiography (OCTA) scans. METHODS: The 6×6 mm macular OCTA 
      scans were acquired on one eye of each participant with a spectral-domain OCTA 
      system. After excluding the central 1 mm diameter circle, the EAA on superficial 
      vascular complex was measured with a deep-learning-based algorithm, and the EVD 
      was obtained with commercial software. RESULTS: The study included 34 healthy 
      controls and 118 diabetic patients. EAA and EVD were highly correlated with DR 
      severity (ρ=0.812 and -0.577, respectively, both p<0.001) and visual acuity 
      (r=-0.357 and 0.420, respectively, both p<0.001). EAA had a significantly 
      (p<0.001) higher correlation with DR severity than EVD. With the specificity at 
      95%, the sensitivities of EAA for differentiating diabetes mellitus (DM), DR and 
      severe DR from control were 80.5%, 92.0% and 100.0%, respectively, significantly 
      higher than those of EVD 11.9% (p=0.001), 13.6% (p<0.001) and 15.8% (p<0.001), 
      respectively. EVD was significantly correlated with signal strength index (SSI) 
      (r=0.607, p<0.001) and shadow area (r=-0.530, p<0.001), but EAA was not 
      (r=-0.044, p=0.805 and r=-0.046, p=0.796, respectively). Adjustment of EVD with 
      SSI and shadow area lowered sensitivities for detection of DM, DR and severe DR. 
      CONCLUSION: Macular EAA on 6×6 mm OCTA measured with a deep learning-based 
      algorithm is less dependent on the signal strength and shadow artefacts, and 
      provides better diagnostic accuracy for DR severity than EVD measured with the 
      instrument-embedded software.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major complications of diabetes. In 
      this study, a diabetic retinopathy risk prediction model integrating machine 
      learning models and SHAP was established to increase the accuracy of risk 
      prediction for diabetic retinopathy, explain the rationality of the findings from 
      model prediction and improve the reliability of prediction results. METHODS: Data 
      were preprocessed for missing values and outliers, features selected through 
      information gain, a diabetic retinopathy risk prediction model established using 
      the CatBoost and the outputs of the mode interpreted using the SHAP model. 
      RESULTS: One thousand early warning data of diabetes complications derived from 
      diabetes complication early warning dataset from the National Clinical Medical 
      Sciences Data Center were used in this study. The CatBoost-based model for 
      diabetic retinopathy prediction performed the best in the comparative model test. 
      ALB_CR, HbA(1c), UPR_24, NEPHROPATHY and SCR were positively correlated with 
      diabetic retinopathy, while CP, HB, ALB, DBILI and CRP were negatively correlated 
      with diabetic retinopathy. The relationships between HEIGHT, WEIGHT and ESR 
      characteristics and diabetic retinopathy were not significant. CONCLUSION: The 
      risk factors for diabetic retinopathy include poor renal function, elevated blood 
      glucose level, liver disease, hematonosis and dysarteriotony, among others. 
      Diabetic retinopathy can be prevented by monitoring and effectively controlling 
      relevant indices. In this study, the influence relationships between the features 
      were also analyzed to further explore the potential factors of diabetic 
      retinopathy, which can provide new methods and new ideas for the early prevention 
      and clinical diagnosis of subsequent diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a predictive risk score model based on 
      deep learning (DL) independent of fundus photography, totally reliant on systemic 
      data through targeted screening from a population-based study to diagnose 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the Indian population. METHODS: It involved machine 
      learning application on datasets of a cross-sectional population-based study. A 
      total of 1425 subjects (1175 subjects with known diabetes and 250 with newly 
      diagnosed diabetes) were included in the study. We applied five machine learning 
      algorithms, random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machines 
      (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and decision trees (DT), to predict 
      diabetic retinopathy in our datasets. We incorporated a percentage split in the 
      first experiment and randomly divided our data set into 80% as a training set and 
      20% as a test set. We performed a three-way data split in the second experiment 
      to prevent overestimating predictive performance. We randomly divided our data 
      set into 60% as a training set, 20% as a validation set, and 20% as the test set. 
      Furthermore, we integrated five-fold cross-validation to split the percentage to 
      evaluate our method. We judged the predictive performance based on the receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy 
      (Acc), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: The RF classifier achieved the best 
      prediction performance with AUC, Acc, and sensitivity values of 0.91, 0.89, and 
      0.90, respectively, in the percentage split. Similarly, a three-way data split 
      attained an outcome of 0.86 and 0.85 in AUC and Acc. Likewise, the five-fold 
      cross-validation performed the best with results of 0.90, 0.97, 0.91, and 0.75 in 
      AUC, Acc, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: Since the RF 
      classifier achieved the best performance, we propose it to identify diabetic 
      retinopathy for targeted screening in the general population.

AB  - Retinal diseases affect an increasing number of patients worldwide because of the 
      aging population. Request for diagnostic imaging in ophthalmology is ramping up, 
      while the number of specialists keeps shrinking. Cutting-edge technology 
      embedding artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are thus advocated to help 
      ophthalmologists perform their clinical tasks as well as to provide a source for 
      the advancement of novel biomarkers. In particular, optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) evaluation of the retina can be augmented by algorithms based on machine 
      learning and deep learning to early detect, qualitatively localize and 
      quantitatively measure epi/intra/subretinal abnormalities or pathological 
      features of macular or neural diseases. In this paper, we discuss the use of AI 
      to facilitate efficacy and accuracy of retinal imaging in those diseases 
      increasingly treated by intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      inhibitors (i.e. anti-VEGF drugs), also including integration and interpretation 
      features in the process. We review recent advances by AI in diabetic retinopathy, 
      age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity that envision a 
      potentially key role of highly automated systems in screening, early diagnosis, 
      grading and individualized therapy. We discuss benefits and critical aspects of 
      automating the evaluation of disease activity, recurrences, the timing of 
      retreatment and therapeutically potential novel targets in ophthalmology. The 
      impact of massive employment of AI to optimize clinical assistance and encourage 
      tailored therapies for distinct patterns of retinal diseases is also discussed.

PG  - 95-100
LID - 10.3928/23258160-20200129-05 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      lesions using the authors' validated machine learning algorithms and provide 
      physicians with an automated and precise method to follow the progression of DR 
      and outcome of interventions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses were 
      conducted of 3,496 color fundus photography images from 19 patients with 
      clinically significant diabetic macular edema receiving conbercept treatment. The 
      modified seven-field fundus images were obtained at baseline and at the third, 
      sixth, and twelfth month visit, whereas the modified two-field fundus images were 
      obtained at the other monthly visits. The area of intraretinal hemorrhage and 
      hard exudate lesions was traced by the authors' validated algorithms. RESULTS: 
      The mean central foveal thickness at baseline was 459.9 μm ± 127.5 μm. Mean 
      central foveal thickness was 316.5 μm ± 53.0 μm at the twelfth month visit, which 
      decreased by 143.4 μm when compared with the baseline optical coherence 
      tomography. The mean total area of intraretinal hemorrhage in the study eye in 
      seven fields was 5.656 ± 1.176 mm(2) at baseline, 2.438 ± 0.976 mm(2) at the 
      third month, 2.901 ± 0.521 mm(2) at the sixth month, and 2.122 ± 0.582 mm(2) at 
      the end of the study. The area of intraretinal hemorrhage was reduced by 62.49% 
      from baseline to the end of study (P < .0001). The mean total area of hard 
      exudates in the study eye was 2.549 ± 0.776 mm(2) at baseline, 2.233 ± 0.576 
      mm(2) at the third month, 2.710 ± 0.621 mm(2) at the sixth month, and 1.473 ± 
      0.564 mm(2) at the end of the study. The mean total area of hard exudates 
      decreased by 41.1% at the twelfth month (P < .0001) compared with the first 
      visit. Significant decrease was observed in the area of intraretinal hemorrhage 
      during conbercept treatment. The hard exudates area fluctuated during loading 
      then subsequently decreased at the twelfth month. CONCLUSIONS: The present study 
      quantitatively analyzed the change in the area change of intraretinal hemorrhage 
      and hard exudate lesions during the course of conbercept treatment. The automated 
      system is promising to be a precise and objective method for monitoring the 
      progression of DR and outcomes of interventions in clinical settings. [Ophthalmic

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm that 
      enhances the quality of a single-frame enface OCTA scan to make it comparable to 
      4-frame averaged scan without the need for the repeated acquisitions required for 
      averaging. METHODS: Each of the healthy eyes and eyes from diabetic subjects that 
      were prospectively enrolled in this cross-sectional study underwent four repeated 
      6 × 6 mm macular scans (PLEX Elite 9000 SS-OCT), and the repeated scans of each 
      eye were co-registered to produce 4-frame averages. This prospective dataset of 
      original (single-frame) enface scans and their corresponding averaged scans was 
      divided into a training dataset and a validation dataset. In the training 
      dataset, a DL algorithm (named pseudoaveraging) was trained using original scans 
      as input and 4-frame averages as target. In the validation dataset, the 
      pseudoaveraging algorithm was applied to single-frame scans to produce 
      pseudoaveraged scans, and the single-frame and its corresponding averaged and 
      pseudoaveraged scans were all qualitatively compared. In a separate 
      retrospectively collected dataset of single-frame scans from eyes of diabetic 
      subjects, the DL algorithm was applied, and the produced pseudoaveraged scan was 
      qualitatively compared against its corresponding original. RESULTS: This study 
      included 39 eyes that comprised the prospective dataset (split into 5 eyes for 
      training and 34 eyes for validating the DL algorithm), and 105 eyes that 
      comprised the retrospective test dataset. Of the total 144 study eyes, 58% had 
      any level of diabetic retinopathy (with and without diabetic macular edema), and 
      the rest were from healthy eyes or eyes of diabetic subjects but without diabetic 
      retinopathy and without macular edema. Grading results in the validation dataset 
      showed that the pseudoaveraged enface scan ranked best in overall scan quality, 
      background noise reduction, and visibility of microaneurysms (p < 0.05). Averaged 
      scan ranked best for motion artifact reduction (p < 0.05). Grading results in the 
      test dataset showed that pseudoaveraging resulted in enhanced small vessels, 
      reduction of background noise, and motion artifact in 100%, 82%, and 98% of 
      scans, respectively. Rates of false-positive/-negative perfusion were zero. 
      CONCLUSION: Pseudoaveraging is a feasible DL approach to more efficiently improve 
      enface OCTA scan quality without introducing notable image artifacts.

AB  - We look at the recent application of deep learning (DL) methods in automated 
      fine-grained segmentation of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      images of the retina. We describe a new method combining fully convolutional 
      networks (FCN) with Gaussian Processes for post processing. We report performance 
      comparisons between the proposed approach, human clinicians, and other machine 
      learning (ML) such as graph based approaches. The approach is demonstrated on an 
      OCT dataset consisting of mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy from the 
      University of Miami. The method is shown to have performance on par with humans, 
      also compares favorably with the other ML methods, and appears to have as small 
      or smaller mean unsigned error (equal to 1.06), versus errors ranging from 1.17 
      to 1.81 for other methods, and compared with human error of 1.10.

AB  - PURPOSE: Disease staging involves the assessment of disease severity or 
      progression and is used for treatment selection. In diabetic retinopathy, disease 
      staging using a wide area is more desirable than that using a limited area. We 
      investigated if deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to grade 
      diabetic retinopathy and determine treatment and prognosis. METHODS: The 
      retrospective study analyzed 9,939 posterior pole photographs of 2,740 patients 
      with diabetes. Nonmydriatic 45° field color fundus photographs were taken of four 
      fields in each eye annually at Jichi Medical University between May 2011 and June 
      2015. A modified fully randomly initialized GoogLeNet deep learning neural 
      network was trained on 95% of the photographs using manual modified Davis grading 
      of three additional adjacent photographs. We graded 4,709 of the 9,939 posterior 
      pole fundus photographs using real prognoses. In addition, 95% of the photographs 
      were learned by the modified GoogLeNet. Main outcome measures were prevalence and 
      bias-adjusted Fleiss' kappa (PABAK) of AI staging of the remaining 5% of the 
      photographs. RESULTS: The PABAK to modified Davis grading was 0.64 (accuracy, 
      81%; correct answer in 402 of 496 photographs). The PABAK to real prognosis 
      grading was 0.37 (accuracy, 96%). CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel AI 
      disease-staging system for grading diabetic retinopathy that involves a retinal 
      area not typically visualized on fundoscopy and another AI that directly suggests 
      treatments and determines prognoses.

TI  - Hemorrhage Detection Based on 3D CNN Deep Learning Framework and Feature Fusion 
      for Evaluating Retinal Abnormality in Diabetic Patients.
LID - 10.3390/s21113865 [doi]
LID - 3865
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the main cause of blindness in diabetic patients. 
      Early and accurate diagnosis can improve the analysis and prognosis of the 
      disease. One of the earliest symptoms of DR are the hemorrhages in the retina. 
      Therefore, we propose a new method for accurate hemorrhage detection from the 
      retinal fundus images. First, the proposed method uses the modified contrast 
      enhancement method to improve the edge details from the input retinal fundus 
      images. In the second stage, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      architecture is proposed to detect hemorrhages. A modified pre-trained CNN model 
      is used to extract features from the detected hemorrhages. In the third stage, 
      all extracted feature vectors are fused using the convolutional sparse image 
      decomposition method, and finally, the best features are selected by using the 
      multi-logistic regression controlled entropy variance approach. The proposed 
      method is evaluated on 1509 images from HRF, DRIVE, STARE, MESSIDOR, DIARETDB0, 
      and DIARETDB1 databases and achieves the average accuracy of 97.71%, which is 
      superior to the previous works. Moreover, the proposed hemorrhage detection 
      system attains better performance, in terms of visual quality and quantitative 
      analysis with high accuracy, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is generally diagnosed 
      by the presence of hemorrhages and hard exudates, is one of the most prevalent 
      causes of visual impairment and blindness. Early detection of hard exudates (HEs) 
      in color fundus photographs can help in preventing such destructive damage. 
      However, this is a challenging task due to high intra-class diversity and high 
      similarity with other structures in the fundus images. Most of the existing 
      methods for detecting HEs are based on characterizing HEs using hand crafted 
      features (HCFs) only, which can not characterize HEs accurately. Deep learning 
      methods are scarce in this domain because they require large-scale sample sets 
      for training which are not generally available for most routine medical imaging 
      research. METHODS: To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology 
      for HE detection using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and multi-feature 
      joint representation. Specifically, we present a new optimized mathematical 
      morphological approach that first segments HE candidates accurately. Then, each 
      candidate is characterized using combined features based on deep features with 
      HCFs incorporated, which is implemented by a ridge regression-based feature 
      fusion. This method employs multi-space-based intensity features, geometric 
      features, a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture descriptor, a 
      gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM)-based texture descriptor to construct HCFs, 
      and a DCNN to automatically learn the deep information of HE. Finally, a random 
      forest is employed to identify the true HEs among candidates. RESULTS: The 
      proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark databases. It obtains an F-score of 
      0.8929 with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9644 on the e-optha database and an 
      F-score of 0.9326 with an AUC of 0.9323 on the HEI-MED database. These results 
      demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our model 
      also proves to be suitable for clinical applications based on private clinical 
      images from a local hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This newly proposed method integrates 
      the traditional HCFs and deep features learned from DCNN for detecting HEs. It 
      achieves a new state-of-the-art in both detecting HEs and DR screening. 
      Furthermore, the proposed feature selection and fusion strategy reduces feature 
      dimension and improves HE detection performance.

AB  - Millions of people are affected by retinal abnormalities worldwide. Early 
      detection and treatment of these abnormalities could arrest further progression, 
      saving multitudes from avoidable blindness. Manual disease detection is 
      time-consuming, tedious and lacks repeatability. There have been efforts to 
      automate ocular disease detection, riding on the successes of the application of 
      Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) for 
      Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). These models have performed well, however, there 
      remain challenges owing to the complex nature of retinal lesions. This work 
      reviews the most common retinal pathologies, provides an overview of prevalent 
      imaging modalities and presents a critical evaluation of current deep-learning 
      research for the detection and grading of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, 
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration and multiple retinal diseases. The work 
      concluded that CAD, through deep learning, will increasingly be vital as an 
      assistive technology. As future work, there is a need to explore the potential 
      impact of using ensemble CNN architectures in multiclass, multilabel tasks. 
      Efforts should also be expended on the improvement of model explainability to win 
      the trust of clinicians and patients.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual impairment globally. It 
      occurs due to long-term diabetes with fluctuating blood glucose levels. It has 
      become a significant concern for people in the working age group as it can lead 
      to vision loss in the future. Manual examination of fundus images is 
      time-consuming and requires much effort and expertise to determine the severity 
      of the retinopathy. To diagnose and evaluate the disease, deep learning-based 
      technologies have been used, which analyze blood vessels, microaneurysms, 
      exudates, macula, optic discs, and hemorrhages also used for initial detection 
      and grading of DR. This study examines the fundamentals of diabetes, its 
      prevalence, complications, and treatment strategies that use artificial 
      intelligence methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and 
      federated learning (FL). The research covers future studies, performance 
      assessments, biomarkers, screening methods, and current datasets. Various neural 
      network designs, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative 
      adversarial networks (GANs), and applications of ML, DL, and FL in the processing 
      of fundus images, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their 
      variations, are thoroughly examined. The potential research methods, such as 
      developing DL models and incorporating heterogeneous data sources, are also 
      outlined. Finally, the challenges and future directions of this research are 
      discussed.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most threatening complications in 
      diabetic patients, leading to permanent blindness without timely treatment. 
      However, DR screening is not only a time-consuming task that requires experienced 
      ophthalmologists but also easy to produce misdiagnosis. In recent years, deep 
      learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks have attracted 
      increasing research attention in medical image analysis, especially for DR 
      diagnosis. However, dataset labeling is expensive work and it is necessary for 
      existing deep-learning-based DR detection models. For this study, a novel domain 
      adaptation method (multi-model domain adaptation) is developed for unsupervised 
      DR classification in unlabeled retinal images. At the same time, it only exploits 
      discriminative information from multiple source models without access to any 
      data. In detail, we integrate a weight mechanism into the multi-model-based 
      domain adaptation by measuring the importance of each source domain in a novel 
      way, and a weighted pseudo-labeling strategy is attached to the source feature 
      extractors for training the target DR classification model. Extensive experiments 
      are performed on four source datasets (DDR, IDRiD, Messidor, and Messidor-2) to a 
      target domain APTOS 2019, showing that MMDA produces competitive performance for 
      present state-of-the-art methods for DR classification. As a novel DR detection 
      approach, this article presents a new domain adaptation solution for medical 
      image analysis when the source data is unavailable.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the present article, we will provide an understanding and 
      review of artificial intelligence in the subspecialty of retina and its potential 
      applications within the specialty. RECENT FINDINGS: Given the significant use of 
      diagnostic imaging within retina, this subspecialty is a fitting area for the 
      incorporation of artificial intelligence. Researchers have aimed at creating 
      models to assist in the diagnosis and management of retinal disease as well as in 
      the prediction of disease course and treatment response. Most of this work thus 
      far has focused on diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and 
      retinopathy of prematurity, although other retinal diseases have started to be 
      explored as well. SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence is well-suited to transform 
      the practice of ophthalmology. A basic understanding of the technology is 
      important for its effective implementation and growth.

TI  - Multi-label classification of retinal lesions in diabetic retinopathy for 
      automatic analysis of fundus fluorescein angiography based on deep learning.
PG  - 779-785
LID - 10.1007/s00417-019-04575-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To automatically detect and classify the lesions of diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) in fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) images using deep learning algorithm 
      through comparing 3 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). METHODS: A total of 
      4067 FFA images from Eye Center at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang 
      University School of Medicine were annotated with 4 kinds of lesions of DR, 
      including non-perfusion regions (NP), microaneurysms, leakages, and laser scars. 
      Three CNNs including DenseNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 were trained to achieve 
      multi-label classification, which means the algorithms could identify 4 retinal 
      lesions above at the same time. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of 
      DenseNet reached 0.8703, 0.9435, 0.9647, and 0.9653 for detecting NP, 
      microaneurysms, leakages, and laser scars, respectively. For ResNet50, AUC was 
      0.8140 for NP, 0.9097 for microaneurysms, 0.9585 for leakages, and 0.9115 for 
      laser scars. And for VGG16, AUC was 0.7125 for NP, 0.5569 for microaneurysms, 
      0.9177 for leakages, and 0.8537 for laser scars. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental 
      results demonstrate that DenseNet is a suitable model to automatically detect and 
      distinguish retinal lesions in the FFA images with multi-label classification, 
      which lies the foundation of automatic analysis for FFA images and comprehensive 
      diagnosis and treatment decision-making for DR.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease facilitated by the rapid spread of 
      diabetes worldwide. DR can blind diabetic individuals. Early detection of DR is 
      essential to restoring vision and providing timely treatment. DR can be detected 
      manually by an ophthalmologist, examining the retinal and fundus images to 
      analyze the macula, morphological changes in blood vessels, hemorrhage, exudates, 
      and/or microaneurysms. This is a time consuming, costly, and challenging task. An 
      automated system can easily perform this function by using artificial 
      intelligence, especially in screening for early DR. Recently, much 
      state-of-the-art research relevant to the identification of DR has been reported. 
      This article describes the current methods of detecting non-proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy, exudates, hemorrhage, and microaneurysms. In addition, the 
      authors point out future directions in overcoming current challenges in the field 
      of DR research.

TI  - Detecting Anomalies in Retinal Diseases Using Generative, Discriminative, and 
      Self-supervised Deep Learning.
PG  - 185-189

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Anomaly detectors could be pursued for retinal diagnoses based on 
      artificial intelligence systems that may not have access to training examples for 
      all retinal diseases in all phenotypic presentations. Possible applications could 
      include screening of population for any retinal disease rather than a specific 
      disease such as diabetic retinopathy, detection of novel retinal diseases or 
      novel presentations of common retinal diseases, and detection of rare diseases 
      with little or no data available for training. OBJECTIVE: To study the 
      application of anomaly detection to retinal diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: High-resolution retinal images from the publicly available EyePACS 
      data set with fundus images with a corresponding label ranging from 0 to 4 for 
      representing different severities of diabetic retinopathy. Sixteen variants of 
      anomaly detectors were designed. For evaluation, a surrogate problem was 
      constructed, using diabetic retinopathy images, in which only retinas with 
      nonreferable diabetic retinopathy, ie, no diabetic macular edema, and no diabetic 
      retinopathy or mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy were used 
      for training an artificial intelligence system, but both nonreferable and 
      referable diabetic retinopathy (including diabetic macular edema or proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy) were used to test the system for detecting retinal disease. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Anomaly detectors were evaluated by commonly accepted 
      performance metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve, F1 score, and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 88 692 high-resolution retinal 
      images of 44 346 individuals with varying severity of diabetic retinopathy were 
      analyzed. The best performing across all anomaly detectors had an area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.789-0.827) and was obtained 
      using an embedding method that involved a self-supervised network. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests when abnormal (diseased) data, ie, referable 
      diabetic retinopathy in this study, were not available for training of retinal 
      diagnostic systems wherein only nonreferable diabetic retinopathy was used for 
      training, anomaly detection techniques were useful in identifying images with and 
      without referable diabetic retinopathy. This suggests that anomaly detectors may 
      be used to detect retinal diseases in more generalized settings and potentially 
      could play a role in screening of populations for retinal diseases or identifying 
      novel diseases and phenotyping or detecting unusual presentations of common 
      retinal diseases.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a major frontier in computer science 
      research. Although AI has broad application across many medical fields, it will 
      have particular utility in ophthalmology and will dramatically change the 
      diagnostic and treatment pathways for many eye conditions such as corneal 
      ectasias, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. 
      However, given that AI has primarily been driven as a computer science, its 
      concepts and terminology are unfamiliar to many medical professionals. Important 
      key terms such as machine learning and deep learning are often misunderstood and 
      incorrectly used interchangeably. This article presents an overview of AI and new 
      developments relevant to ophthalmology.

AB  - We have attempted to reproduce the results in Development and validation of a 
      deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus 
      photographs, published in JAMA 2016; 316(22), using publicly available data sets. 
      We re-implemented the main method in the original study since the source code is 
      not available. The original study used non-public fundus images from EyePACS and 
      three hospitals in India for training. We used a different EyePACS data set from 
      Kaggle. The original study used the benchmark data set Messidor-2 to evaluate the 
      algorithm's performance. We used another distribution of the Messidor-2 data set, 
      since the original data set is no longer available. In the original study, 
      ophthalmologists re-graded all images for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, 
      and image gradability. We have one diabetic retinopathy grade per image for our 
      data sets, and we assessed image gradability ourselves. We were not able to 
      reproduce the original study's results with publicly available data. Our 
      algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.951 
      (95% CI, 0.947-0.956) on the Kaggle EyePACS test set and 0.853 (95% CI, 
      0.835-0.871) on Messidor-2 did not come close to the reported AUC of 0.99 on both 
      test sets in the original study. This may be caused by the use of a single grade 
      per image, or different data. This study shows the challenges of reproducing deep 
      learning method results, and the need for more replication and reproduction 
      studies to validate deep learning methods, especially for medical image analysis.

TI  - Adversarial Attack and Defence through Adversarial Training and Feature Fusion 
      for Diabetic Retinopathy Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s21113922 [doi]
LID - 3922
AB  - Due to the rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) 
      approaches, the security and robustness of the deployed algorithms need to be 
      guaranteed. The security susceptibility of the DL algorithms to adversarial 
      examples has been widely acknowledged. The artificially created examples will 
      lead to different instances negatively identified by the DL models that are 
      humanly considered benign. Practical application in actual physical scenarios 
      with adversarial threats shows their features. Thus, adversarial attacks and 
      defense, including machine learning and its reliability, have drawn growing 
      interest and, in recent years, has been a hot topic of research. We introduce a 
      framework that provides a defensive model against the adversarial speckle-noise 
      attack, the adversarial training, and a feature fusion strategy, which preserves 
      the classification with correct labelling. We evaluate and analyze the 
      adversarial attacks and defenses on the retinal fundus images for the Diabetic 
      Retinopathy recognition problem, which is considered a state-of-the-art endeavor. 
      Results obtained on the retinal fundus images, which are prone to adversarial 
      attacks, are 99% accurate and prove that the proposed defensive model is robust.

TI  - HDR-EfficientNet: A Classification of Hypertensive and Diabetic Retinopathy Using 
      Optimize EfficientNet Architecture.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13203236 [doi]
LID - 3236
AB  - Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are retinal diseases 
      closely associated with high blood pressure. The severity and duration of 
      hypertension directly impact the prevalence of HR. The early identification and 
      assessment of HR are crucial to preventing blindness. Currently, limited 
      computer-aided methods are available for detecting HR and DR. These existing 
      systems rely on traditional machine learning approaches, which require complex 
      image processing techniques and are often limited in their application. To 
      address this challenge, this work introduces a deep learning (DL) method called 
      HDR-EfficientNet, which aims to provide an efficient and accurate approach to 
      identifying various eye-related disorders, including diabetes and hypertensive 
      retinopathy. The proposed method utilizes an EfficientNet-V2 network for 
      end-to-end training focused on disease classification. Additionally, a 
      spatial-channel attention method is incorporated into the approach to enhance its 
      ability to identify specific areas of damage and differentiate between different 
      illnesses. The HDR-EfficientNet model is developed using transfer learning, which 
      helps overcome the challenge of imbalanced sample classes and improves the 
      network's generalization. Dense layers are added to the model structure to 
      enhance the feature selection capacity. The performance of the implemented system 
      is evaluated using a large dataset of over 36,000 augmented retinal fundus 
      images. The results demonstrate promising accuracy, with an average area under 
      the curve (AUC) of 0.98, a specificity (SP) of 96%, an accuracy (ACC) of 98%, and 
      a sensitivity (SE) of 95%. These findings indicate the effectiveness of the 
      suggested HDR-EfficientNet classifier in diagnosing HR and DR. In summary, the 
      HDR-EfficientNet method presents a DL-based approach that offers improved 
      accuracy and efficiency for the detection and classification of HR and DR, 
      providing valuable support in diagnosing and managing these eye-related 
      conditions.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains one of the world's frequent eye illnesses, 
      leading to vision loss among working-aged individuals. Hemorrhages and exudates 
      are examples of signs of DR. However, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly 
      deep learning (DL), is poised to impact nearly every aspect of human life and 
      gradually transform medical practice. Insight into the condition of the retina is 
      becoming more accessible thanks to major advancements in diagnostic technology. 
      AI approaches can be used to assess lots of morphological datasets derived from 
      digital images in a rapid and noninvasive manner. Computer-aided diagnosis tools 
      for automatic detection of DR early-stage signs will ease the pressure on 
      clinicians. In this work, we apply two methods to the color fundus images taken 
      on-site at the Cheikh Zaïd Foundation's Ophthalmic Center in Rabat to detect both 
      exudates and hemorrhages. First, we apply the U-Net method to segment exudates 
      and hemorrhages into red and green colors, respectively. Second, the You Look 
      Only Once Version 5 (YOLOv5) method identifies the presence of hemorrhages and 
      exudates in an image and predicts a probability for each bounding box. The 
      segmentation proposed method obtained a specificity of 85%, a sensitivity of 85%, 
      and a Dice score of 85%. The detection software successfully detected 100% of 
      diabetic retinopathy signs, the expert doctor detected 99% of DR signs, and the 
      resident doctor detected 84%.

AB  - Entropy images, representing the complexity of original fundus photographs, may 
      strengthen the contrast between diabetic retinopathy (DR) lesions and unaffected 
      areas. The aim of this study is to compare the detection performance for severe 
      DR between original fundus photographs and entropy images by deep learning. A 
      sample of 21,123 interpretable fundus photographs obtained from a publicly 
      available data set was expanded to 33,000 images by rotating and flipping. All 
      photographs were transformed into entropy images using block size 9 and downsized 
      to a standard resolution of 100 × 100 pixels. The stages of DR are classified 
      into 5 grades based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease 
      Severity Scale: Grade 0 (no DR), Grade 1 (mild nonproliferative DR), Grade 2 
      (moderate nonproliferative DR), Grade 3 (severe nonproliferative DR), and Grade 4 
      (proliferative DR). Of these 33,000 photographs, 30,000 images were randomly 
      selected as the training set, and the remaining 3,000 images were used as the 
      testing set. Both the original fundus photographs and the entropy images were 
      used as the inputs of convolutional neural network (CNN), and the results of 
      detecting referable DR (Grades 2-4) as the outputs from the two data sets were 
      compared. The detection accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of using the 
      original fundus photographs data set were 81.80%, 68.36%, 89.87%, respectively, 
      for the entropy images data set, and the figures significantly increased to 
      86.10%, 73.24%, and 93.81%, respectively (all p values <0.001). The entropy image 
      quantifies the amount of information in the fundus photograph and efficiently 
      accelerates the generating of feature maps in the CNN. The research results draw 
      the conclusion that transformed entropy imaging of fundus photographs can 
      increase the machinery detection accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 
      referable DR for the deep learning-based system.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an outcome of prolonged diabetes which directly or 
      indirectly affect the human vision. DR is asymptomatic in its early stages and 
      the late diagnosis lead to undeviating loss of vision. The computer aided 
      diagnosis with the assistance of medical images helps in timely and accurate 
      treatment. Microaneurysms (MA) mark the onset of DR, thus a vital point in 
      screening of this disease. This review discuses various state of the art methods 
      available till date for automated computer aided analysis of microaneurysms and 
      haemorrhages. The paper also highlights qualitative and quantitative comparison 
      of the existing literature with limitations for analysis of microaneurysms and 
      haemorrhages. It is an attempt to systematize the available algorithms for an 
      easy gathering and guidance to researchers working in this domain for future 
      research.

TI  - Image quality assessment of retinal fundus photographs for diabetic retinopathy 
      in the machine learning era: a review.
PG  - 426-433

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the image quality assessment (IQA) and quality 
      criteria employed in publicly available datasets for diabetic retinopathy (DR). A 
      literature search strategy was used to identify relevant datasets, and 20 
      datasets were included in the analysis. Out of these, 12 datasets mentioned 
      performing IQA, but only eight specified the quality criteria used. The reported 
      quality criteria varied widely across datasets, and accessing the information was 
      often challenging. The findings highlight the importance of IQA for AI model 
      development while emphasizing the need for clear and accessible reporting of IQA 
      information. The study suggests that automated quality assessments can be a valid 
      alternative to manual labeling and emphasizes the importance of establishing 
      quality standards based on population characteristics, clinical use, and research 
      purposes. In conclusion, image quality assessment is important for AI model 
      development; however, strict data quality standards must not limit data sharing. 
      Given the importance of IQA for developing, validating, and implementing deep 
      learning (DL) algorithms, it's recommended that this information be reported in a 
      clear, specific, and accessible way whenever possible. Automated quality 
      assessments are a valid alternative to the traditional manual labeling process, 
      and quality standards should be determined according to population 
      characteristics, clinical use, and research purpose.

TI  - Automatic Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Stage Focusing Exclusively on Retinal 
      Hemorrhage.
LID - 10.3390/medicina58111681 [doi]
LID - 1681
AB  - Background and Objectives: The present study evaluated the detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) using an automated fundus camera focusing exclusively on retinal 
      hemorrhage (RH) using a deep convolutional neural network, which is a 
      machine-learning technology. Materials and Methods: This investigation was 
      conducted via a prospective and observational study. The study included 89 fundus 
      ophthalmoscopy images. Seventy images passed an image quality review and were 
      graded as showing no apparent DR (n = 51), mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR; n = 
      16), moderate NPDR (n = 1), severe NPDR (n = 1), and proliferative DR (n = 1) by 
      three retinal experts according to the International Clinical Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Severity scale. The RH numbers and areas were automatically detected 
      and the results of two tests-the detection of mild-or-worse NPDR and the 
      detection of moderate-or-worse NPDR-were examined. Results: The detection of 
      mild-or-worse DR showed a sensitivity of 0.812 (95% confidence interval: 
      0.680-0.945), specificity of 0.888, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.884, 
      whereas the detection of moderate-or-worse DR showed a sensitivity of 1.0, 
      specificity of 1.0, and AUC of 1.0. Conclusions: Automated diagnosis using 
      artificial intelligence focusing exclusively on RH could be used to diagnose DR 
      requiring ophthalmologist intervention.

AB  - Applications of artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning, in 
      ophthalmology research have started with the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy 
      and have now expanded to all areas of ophthalmology, mainly in the identification 
      of fundus diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. In 
      addition to fundus photography, optical coherence tomography is often used as an 
      imaging device. In addition to simple binary classification, region 
      identification (segmentation model) is used as an identification method for 
      interpretability. Furthermore, there have been AI applications in the area of 
      regression estimation, which is different from diagnostic identification. While 
      expectations for deep learning AI are rising, regulatory agencies have begun 
      issuing guidance on the medical applications of AI. The reason behind this trend 
      is that there are a number of existing issues regarding the application of AI 
      that need to be considered, including, but not limited to, the handling of 
      personal information by large technology companies, the black-box issue, the 
      flaming issue, the theory of responsibility, and issues related to improving the 
      performance of commercially available AI. Furthermore, researchers have reported 
      that there are a plethora of issues that simply cannot be solved by the high 
      performance of artificial intelligence models, such as educating users and 
      securing the communication environment, which are just a few of the necessary 
      steps toward the actual implementation process of an AI society. Multifaceted 
      perspectives and efforts are needed to create better ophthalmology care through 
      AI.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate deep learning models that screen multiple 
      abnormal findings in retinal fundus images. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: For the development and testing of deep learning models, 309 786 
      readings from 103 262 images were used. Two additional external datasets (the 
      Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset and e-ophtha) were used for testing. A 
      third external dataset (Messidor) was used for comparison of the models with 
      human experts. METHODS: Macula-centered retinal fundus images from the Seoul 
      National University Bundang Hospital Retina Image Archive, obtained at the health 
      screening center and ophthalmology outpatient clinic at Seoul National University 
      Bundang Hospital, were assessed for 12 major findings (hemorrhage, hard exudate, 
      cotton-wool patch, drusen, membrane, macular hole, myelinated nerve fiber, 
      chorioretinal atrophy or scar, any vascular abnormality, retinal nerve fiber 
      layer defect, glaucomatous disc change, and nonglaucomatous disc change) with 
      their regional information using deep learning algorithms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity and 
      specificity of the deep learning algorithms at the highest harmonic mean were 
      evaluated and compared with the performance of retina specialists, and 
      visualization of the lesions was qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Areas under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curves for all findings were high at 96.2% to 
      99.9% when tested in the in-house dataset. Lesion heatmaps highlight salient 
      regions effectively in various findings. Areas under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves for diabetic retinopathy-related findings tested in the 
      Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset and e-ophtha dataset were 94.7% to 
      98.0%. The model demonstrated a performance that rivaled that of human experts, 
      especially in the detection of hemorrhage, hard exudate, membrane, macular hole, 
      myelinated nerve fiber, and glaucomatous disc change. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep 
      learning algorithms with region guidance showed reliable performance for 
      detection of multiple findings in macula-centered retinal fundus images. These 
      interpretable, as well as reliable, classification outputs open the possibility 
      for clinical use as an automated screening system for retinal fundus images.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early detection and grading of Diabetic Retinopathy 
      (DR) is essential to determine an adequate treatment and prevent severe vision 
      loss. However, the manual analysis of fundus images is time consuming and DR 
      screening programs are challenged by the availability of human graders. Current 
      automatic approaches for DR grading attempt the joint detection of all signs at 
      the same time. However, the classification can be optimized if red lesions and 
      bright lesions are independently processed since the task gets divided and 
      simplified. Furthermore, clinicians would greatly benefit from explainable 
      artificial intelligence (XAI) to support the automatic model predictions, 
      especially when the type of lesion is specified. As a novelty, we propose an 
      end-to-end deep learning framework for automatic DR grading (5 severity degrees) 
      based on separating the attention of the dark structures from the bright 
      structures of the retina. As the main contribution, this approach allowed us to 
      generate independent interpretable attention maps for red lesions, such as 
      microaneurysms and hemorrhages, and bright lesions, such as hard exudates, while 
      using image-level labels only. METHODS: Our approach is based on a novel 
      attention mechanism which focuses separately on the dark and the bright 
      structures of the retina by performing a previous image decomposition. This 
      mechanism can be seen as a XAI approach which generates independent attention 
      maps for red lesions and bright lesions. The framework includes an image quality 
      assessment stage and deep learning-related techniques, such as data augmentation, 
      transfer learning and fine-tuning. We used the architecture Xception as a feature 
      extractor and the focal loss function to deal with data imbalance. RESULTS: The 
      Kaggle DR detection dataset was used for method development and validation. The 
      proposed approach achieved 83.7 % accuracy and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.78 
      to classify DR among 5 severity degrees, which outperforms several 
      state-of-the-art approaches. Nevertheless, the main result of this work is the 
      generated attention maps, which reveal the pathological regions on the image 
      distinguishing the red lesions and the bright lesions. These maps provide 
      explainability to the model predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      our framework is effective to automatically grade DR. The separate attention 
      approach has proven useful for optimizing the classification. On top of that, the 
      obtained attention maps facilitate visual interpretation for clinicians. 
      Therefore, the proposed method could be a diagnostic aid for the early detection 
      and grading of DR.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is an eye deficiency that affects retina as a result of the 
      patient having diabetes mellitus caused by high sugar levels, which may 
      eventually lead to macular edema. The objective of this study is to design and 
      compare several deep learning models that detect severity of diabetic 
      retinopathy, determine risk of leading to macular edema, and segment different 
      types of disease patterns using retina images. Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image 
      Dataset (IDRiD) dataset was used for disease grading and segmentation. Since 
      images of the dataset have different brightness and contrast, we employed three 
      techniques for generating processed images from the original images, which 
      include brightness, color and, contrast (BCC) enhancing, color jitters (CJ), and 
      contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). After image 
      preporcessing, we used pre-trained ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19 models on these 
      different preprocessed images both for determining the severity of the 
      retinopathy and also the chances of macular edema. UNet was also applied to 
      segment different types of diseases. To train and test these models, image 
      dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation data at 70%, 20%, and 
      10% ratios, respectively. During model training, data augmentation method was 
      also applied to increase the number of training images. Study results show that 
      for detecting the severity of retinopathy and macular edema, ResNet50 showed the 
      best accuracy using BCC and original images with an accuracy of 60.2% and 82.5%, 
      respectively, on validation dataset. In segmenting different types of diseases, 
      UNet yielded the highest testing accuracy of 65.22% and 91.09% for microaneurysms 
      and hard exudates using BCC images, 84.83% for optic disc using CJ images, 59.35% 
      and 89.69% for hemorrhages and soft exudates using CLAHE images, respectively. 
      Thus, image preprocessing can play an important role to improve efficacy and 
      performance of deep learning models.

AB  - In recent years, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) 
      models is attracting increasing global interest in the field of ophthalmology. DL 
      models are considered the current state-of-art among the AI technologies. In 
      fact, DL systems have the capability to recognize, quantify and describe 
      pathological clinical features. Their role is currently being investigated for 
      the early diagnosis and management of several retinal diseases and glaucoma. The 
      application of DL models to fundus photographs, visual fields and optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) imaging has provided promising results in the early 
      detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), wet age-related macular degeneration 
      (w-AMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and glaucoma. In this review we analyze 
      the current evidence of AI applied to these ocular diseases, as well as discuss 
      the possible future developments and potential clinical implications, without 
      neglecting the present limitations and challenges in order to adopt AI and DL 
      models as powerful tools in the everyday routine clinical practice.

AB  - Detecting the early signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is essential, as timely 
      treatment might reduce or even prevent vision loss. Moreover, automatically 
      localizing the regions of the retinal image that might contain lesions can 
      favorably assist specialists in the task of detection. In this study, we designed 
      a lesion localization model using a deep network patch-based approach. Our goal 
      was to reduce the complexity of the model while improving its performance. For 
      this purpose, we designed an efficient procedure (including two convolutional 
      neural network models) for selecting the training patches, such that the 
      challenging examples would be given special attention during the training 
      process. Using the labeling of the region, a DR decision can be given to the 
      initial image, without the need for special training. The model is trained on the 
      Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database, Calibration Level 1 (DIARETDB1) database 
      and is tested on several databases (including Messidor) without any further 
      adaptation. It reaches an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      of 0.912-95%CI(0.897-0.928) for DR screening, and a sensitivity of 
      0.940-95%CI(0.921-0.959). These values are competitive with other 
      state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective screening is a desirable method for the early detection and 
      successful treatment for diabetic retinopathy, and fundus photography is 
      currently the dominant medium for retinal imaging due to its convenience and 
      accessibility. Manual screening using fundus photographs has however involved 
      considerable costs for patients, clinicians and national health systems, which 
      has limited its application particularly in less-developed countries. The advent 
      of artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning techniques, has 
      however raised the possibility of widespread automated screening. MAIN TEXT: In 
      this review, we first briefly survey major published advances in retinal analysis 
      using artificial intelligence. We take care to separately describe standard 
      multiple-field fundus photography, and the newer modalities of ultra-wide field 
      photography and smartphone-based photography. Finally, we consider several 
      machine learning concepts that have been particularly relevant to the domain and 
      illustrate their usage with extant works. CONCLUSIONS: In the ophthalmology 
      field, it was demonstrated that deep learning tools for diabetic retinopathy show 
      clinically acceptable diagnostic performance when using colour retinal fundus 
      images. Artificial intelligence models are among the most promising solutions to 
      tackle the burden of diabetic retinopathy management in a comprehensive manner. 
      However, future research is crucial to assess the potential clinical deployment, 
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different DL systems in clinical practice and 
      improve clinical acceptance.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is considered one of the most common diseases that can lead 
      to blindness in the working age, and the chance of developing it increases as 
      long as a person suffers from diabetes. Protecting the sight of the patient or 
      decelerating the evolution of this disease depends on its early detection as well 
      as identifying the exact levels of this pathology, which is done manually by 
      ophthalmologists. This manual process is very consuming in terms of the time and 
      experience of an expert ophthalmologist, which makes developing an automated 
      method to aid in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy an essential and urgent 
      need. In this paper, we aim to propose a new hybrid deep learning method based on 
      a fine-tuning vision transformer and a modified capsule network for automatic 
      diabetic retinopathy severity level prediction. The proposed approach consists of 
      a new range of computer vision operations, including the power law transformation 
      technique and the contrast-limiting adaptive histogram equalization technique in 
      the preprocessing step. While the classification step builds up on a fine-tuning 
      vision transformer, a modified capsule network, and a classification model 
      combined with a classification model, The effectiveness of our approach was 
      evaluated using four datasets, including the APTOS, Messidor-2, DDR, and EyePACS 
      datasets, for the task of severity levels of diabetic retinopathy. We have 
      attained excellent test accuracy scores on the four datasets, respectively: 
      88.18%, 87.78%, 80.36%, and 78.64%. Comparing our results with the 
      state-of-the-art, we reached a better performance.

AB  - The European Medicines Agency has defined Big Data by the "3 V's": Volume, 
      Velocity and Variety. These large databases allow access to real life data on 
      patient care. They are particularly suited for studies of adverse events and 
      pharmacoepidemiology. Deep learning is a collection of algorithms used in machine 
      learning, used to model high-level abstractions in data using model 
      architectures, which are composed of multiple nonlinear transformations. This 
      article shows how Big Data and Deep Learning can help in ophthalmology, pointing 
      out their advantages and disadvantages. A literature review is presented in this 
      article illustrating the uses of Deep Learning in ophthalmology.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a late microvascular complication of Diabetes 
      Mellitus (DM) that could lead to permanent blindness in patients, without early 
      detection. Although adequate management of DM via regular eye examination can 
      preserve vision in in 98% of the DR cases, DR screening and diagnoses based on 
      clinical lesion features devised by expert clinicians; are costly, time-consuming 
      and not sufficiently accurate. This raises the requirements for Artificial 
      Intelligent (AI) systems which can accurately detect DR automatically and thus 
      preventing DR before affecting vision. Hence, such systems can help clinician 
      experts in certain cases and aid ophthalmologists in rapid diagnoses. To address 
      such requirements, several approaches have been proposed in the literature that 
      use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to develop such 
      systems. However, these approaches ignore the highly valuable clinical lesion 
      features that could contribute significantly to the accurate detection of DR. 
      Therefore, in this study we introduce a framework called DR-detector that employs 
      the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of 
      the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly 
      known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features 
      for accurate detection of DR. The retinal lesion features are extracted via image 
      segmentation technique using the UNET DL model and captures exudates (EXs), 
      microaneurysms (MAs), and hemorrhages (HEMs) that are relevant lesions for DR 
      detection. The feature combination approach implemented in DR-detector has been 
      applied to two common TL models in the literature namely VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We 
      trained the DR-detector model using a training dataset comprising of 1,840 color 
      fundus images collected from e-ophtha, retinal lesions and APTOS 2019 Kaggle 
      datasets of which 920 images are healthy. To validate the DR-detector model, we 
      test the model on external dataset that consists of 81 healthy images collected 
      from High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) dataset and MESSIDOR-2 datasets and 81 images 
      with DR signs collected from Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) 
      dataset annotated for DR by expert. The experimental results show that the 
      DR-detector model achieves a testing accuracy of 100% in detecting DR after 
      training it with the combination of ResNet-50 and lesion features and 99.38% 
      accuracy after training it with the combination of VGG-16 and lesion features. 
      More importantly, the results also show a higher contribution of specific lesion 
      features toward the performance of the DR-detector model. For instance, using 
      only the hemorrhages feature to train the model, our model achieves an accuracy 
      of 99.38 in detecting DR, which is higher than the accuracy when training the 
      model with the combination of all lesion features (89%) and equal to the accuracy 
      when training the model with the combination of all lesions and VGG-16 features 
      together. This highlights the possibility of using only the clinical features, 
      such as lesions that are clinically interpretable, to build the next generation 
      of robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems with great clinical 
      interpretability for DR detection. The code of the DR-detector framework is 
      available on GitHub at https://github.com/Janga-Lab/DR-detector and can be 
      readily employed for detecting DR from retinal image datasets.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the primary cause of blindness in adults. 
      Incorporating machine learning into DR grading can improve the accuracy of 
      medical diagnosis. However, problems, such as severe data imbalance, persists. 
      Existing studies on DR grading ignore the correlation between its labels. In this 
      study, a category weighted network (CWN) was proposed to achieve data balance at 
      the model level. In the CWN, a reference for weight settings is provided by 
      calculating the category gradient norm and reducing the experimental overhead. We 
      proposed to use relation weighted labels instead of the one-hot label to 
      investigate the distance relationship between labels. Experiments revealed that 
      the proposed CWN achieved excellent performance on various DR datasets. 
      Furthermore, relation weighted labels exhibit broad applicability and can improve 
      other methods using one-hot labels. The proposed method achieved kappa scores of 
      0.9431 and 0.9226 and accuracy of 90.94% and 86.12% on DDR and APTOS datasets, 
      respectively.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is an increasingly prevalent eye disorder that can lead to 
      severe vision impairment. The severity grading of the disease using retinal 
      images is key to provide an adequate treatment. However, in order to learn the 
      diverse patterns and complex relations that are required for the grading, deep 
      neural networks require very large annotated datasets that are not always 
      available. This has been typically addressed by reusing networks that were 
      pre-trained for natural image classification, hence relying on additional 
      annotated data from a different domain. In contrast, we propose a novel 
      pre-training approach that takes advantage of unlabeled multimodal visual data 
      commonly available in ophthalmology. The use of multimodal visual data for 
      pre-training purposes has been previously explored by training a network in the 
      prediction of one image modality from another. However, that approach does not 
      ensure a broad understanding of the retinal images, given that the network may 
      exclusively focus on the similarities between modalities while ignoring the 
      differences. Thus, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training that 
      explicitly teaches the networks to learn the common characteristics between 
      modalities as well as the characteristics that are exclusive to the input 
      modality. This provides a complete comprehension of the input domain and 
      facilitates the training of downstream tasks that require a broad understanding 
      of the retinal images, such as the grading of diabetic retinopathy. To validate 
      and analyze the proposed approach, we performed an exhaustive experimentation on 
      different public datasets. The transfer learning performance for the grading of 
      diabetic retinopathy is evaluated under different settings while also comparing 
      against previous state-of-the-art pre-training approaches. Additionally, a 
      comparison against relevant state-of-the-art works for the detection and grading 
      of diabetic retinopathy is also provided. The results show a satisfactory 
      performance of the proposed approach, which outperforms previous pre-training 
      alternatives in the grading of diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Vision Transformer-based recognition of diabetic retinopathy grade.
PG  - 7850-7863
LID - 10.1002/mp.15312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the domain of natural language processing, Transformers are 
      recognized as state-of-the-art models, which opposing to typical convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs) do not rely on convolution layers. Instead, Transformers 
      employ multi-head attention mechanisms as the main building block to capture 
      long-range contextual relations between image pixels. Recently, CNNs dominated 
      the deep learning solutions for diabetic retinopathy grade recognition. However, 
      spurred by the advantages of Transformers, we propose a Transformer-based method 
      that is appropriate for recognizing the grade of diabetic retinopathy. PURPOSE: 
      The purposes of this work are to demonstrate that (i) the pure attention 
      mechanism is suitable for diabetic retinopathy grade recognition and (ii) 
      Transformers can replace traditional CNNs for diabetic retinopathy grade 
      recognition. METHODS: This paper proposes a Vision Transformer-based method to 
      recognize the grade of diabetic retinopathy. Fundus images are subdivided into 
      non-overlapping patches, which are then converted into sequences by flattening, 
      and undergo a linear and positional embedding process to preserve positional 
      information. Then, the generated sequence is input into several multi-head 
      attention layers to generate the final representation. The first token sequence 
      is input to a softmax classification layer to produce the recognition output in 
      the classification stage. RESULTS: The dataset for training and testing employs 
      fundus images of different resolutions, subdivided into patches. We challenge our 
      method against current CNNs and extreme learning machines and achieve an 
      appealing performance. Specifically, the suggested deep learning architecture 
      attains an accuracy of 91.4%, specificity = 0.977 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      (0.951-1)), precision = 0.928 (95% CI (0.852-1)), sensitivity = 0.926 (95% CI 
      (0.863-0.989)), quadratic weighted kappa score = 0.935, and area under curve 
      (AUC) = 0.986. CONCLUSION: Our comparative experiments against current methods 
      conclude that our model is competitive and highlight that an attention mechanism 
      based on a Vision Transformer model is promising for the diabetic retinopathy 
      grade recognition task.

AB  - One of the major causes of blindness in human beings is the diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). To prevent blindness, early detection of DR is therefore necessary. In this 
      paper, a hybrid model is proposed for diagnosing DR from fundus images. A 
      combination of morphological image processing and Inception v3 deep learning 
      techniques are exploited to detect DR as well as to classify healthy, mild 
      non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and proliferative DR 
      (PDR). The proposed algorithm was carried out in several steps such as 
      segmentation of blood vessels, localization and removal of optic disc, and 
      macula, abnormal features detection (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and 
      neovascularization), and classification. Microaneurysms and hemorrhages that 
      appear in the retina are the early signs of DR. In this work, we have detected 
      microaneurysms and hemorrhages by applying dynamic contrast limited adaptive 
      histogram equalization and threshold value on overlapping patched images. An 
      overall accuracy of 96.83% is obtained to classify DR into five different stages. 
      The better performance demonstrates the effectiveness and novelty of the proposed 
      work as compared to the recent reported work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of a deep learning model to distinguish between 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), retinal vein occlusions 
      (RVOs) and healthy eyes using ultra-widefield colour fundus photography 
      (UWF-CFP). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this retrospective study, UWF-CFP images of 
      patients with retinal vascular disease (DR, RVO, and SCR) and healthy controls 
      were included. The images were used to train a multilayer deep convolutional 
      neural network to differentiate on UWF-CFP between different vascular diseases 
      and healthy controls. A total of 224 UWF-CFP images were included, of which 169 
      images were of retinal vascular diseases and 55 were healthy controls. A 
      cross-validation technique was used to ensure that every image from the dataset 
      was tested once. Established augmentation techniques were applied to enhance 
      performances, along with an Adam optimiser for training. The visualisation method 
      was integrated gradient visualisation. RESULTS: The best performance of the model 
      was obtained using 10 epochs, with an overall accuracy of 88.4%. For DR, the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was 90.5% and the 
      accuracy was 85.2%. For RVO, the AUC was 91.2% and the accuracy 88.4%. For SCR, 
      the AUC was 96.7% and the accuracy 93.8%. For healthy controls, the ROC was 88.5% 
      with an accuracy that reached 86.2%. CONCLUSION: Deep learning algorithms can 
      classify several retinal vascular diseases on UWF-CPF with good accuracy. This 
      technology may be a useful tool for telemedicine and areas with a shortage of 
      ophthalmic care.

TI  - DRRisk: A Web-based tool to Assess the Risk of Diabetic Retinopathy through 
      Machine Learning on Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 452-460
AB  - Objective: We developed a web-based tool for diabetic retinopathy (DR) risk 
      assessment called DRRisk (https://drandml.cdrewu.edu/) using machine learning on 
      electronic health record (EHR) data, with a goal of preventing vision loss in 
      persons with diabetes, especially in underserved settings. Methods: DRRisk uses 
      Python's Flask framework. Its user-interface is implemented using HTML, CSS and 
      Javascript. Clinical experts were consulted on the tool's design. Results: DRRisk 
      assesses current DR risk for people with diabetes, categorizing their risk level 
      as low, moderate, or high, depending on the percentage of DR risk assigned by the 
      underlying machine learning model. Discussion: A goal of our tool is to help 
      providers prioritize patients at high risk for DR in order to prevent blindness. 
      Conclusion: Our tool uses DR risk factors from EHR data to calculate a diabetic 
      person's current DR risk. It may be useful for identifying unscreened diabetic 
      patients who have undiagnosed DR.

AB  - Diabetes retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. 
      Early detection of this condition is essential for preventing patients' loss of 
      eyesight caused by diabetes mellitus being untreated for an extended period. This 
      paper proposes the design of an augmented bioinspired multidomain feature 
      extraction and selection model for diabetic retinopathy severity estimation using 
      an ensemble learning process. The proposed approach initiates by identifying DR 
      severity levels from retinal images that segment the optical disc, macula, blood 
      vessels, exudates, and hemorrhages using an adaptive thresholding process. Once 
      the images are segmented, multidomain features are extracted from the retinal 
      images, including frequency, entropy, cosine, gabor, and wavelet components. 
      These data were fed into a novel Modified Moth Flame Optimization-based feature 
      selection method that assisted in optimal feature selection. Finally, an ensemble 
      model using various ML (machine learning) algorithms, which included Naive Bayes, 
      K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Random 
      Forests, and Logistic Regression were used to identify the various severity 
      complications of DR. The experiments on different openly accessible data sources 
      have shown that the proposed method outperformed conventional methods and 
      achieved an Accuracy of 96.5% in identifying DR severity levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetic retinopathy is a type of diabetes that causes 
      vascular changes that can lead to blindness. The ravages of this disease cannot 
      be reversed, so early detection is essential. This work presents an automated 
      method for early detection of this disease using fundus colored images. METHODS: 
      A bio-inspired approach is proposed on synaptic metaplasticity in convolutional 
      neural networks. This biological phenomenon is known to directly interfere in 
      both learning and memory by reinforcing less common occurrences during the 
      learning process. Synaptic metaplasticity has been included in the 
      backpropagation stage of a convolution operation for every convolutional layer. 
      RESULTS: The proposed method has been evaluated by using a public small diabetic 
      retinopathy dataset from Kaggle with four award-winning convolutional neural 
      network architectures. Results show that convolutional neural network 
      architectures including synaptic metaplasticity improve both learning rate and 
      accuracy. Furthermore, obtained results outperform other methods in current 
      literature, even using smaller datasets for training. Best results have been 
      obtained for the InceptionV3 architecture with synaptic metaplasticity with a 
      95.56% accuracy, 94.24% F1-score, 98.9% precision and 90% recall, using 3662 
      images for training. CONCLUSIONS: Convolutional neural networks with synaptic 
      metaplasticity are suitable for early detection of diabetic retinopathy due to 
      their fast convergence rate, training simplicity and high performance.

AB  - Systematic screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been widely recommended 
      for early detection in patients with diabetes to address preventable vision loss. 
      However, substantial manpower and financial resources are required to deploy 
      opportunistic screening and transition to systematic DR screening programs. The 
      advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may improve access and reduce 
      the financial burden for DR screening while maintaining comparable or enhanced 
      clinical effectiveness. To deploy an AI-based DR screening program in a 
      real-world setting, it is imperative that health economic assessment (HEA) and 
      patient safety analyses are conducted to guide appropriate allocation of 
      resources and design safe, reliable systems. Few studies published to date 
      include these considerations when integrating AI-based solutions into DR 
      screening programs. In this article, we provide an overview of the current 
      state-of-the-art of AI technology (focusing on deep learning systems), followed 
      by an appraisal of existing literature on the applications of AI in 
      ophthalmology. We also discuss practical considerations that drive the 
      development of a successful DR screening program, such as the implications of 
      false-positive or false-negative results and image gradeability. Finally, we 
      examine different plausible methods for HEA and safety analyses that can be used 
      to assess concerns regarding AI-based screening.

      directions.

LID - 3
AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought breakthroughs in many areas 
      of medicine. In ophthalmology, AI has delivered robust results in the screening 
      and detection of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. Cataract management is another field 
      that can benefit from greater AI application. Cataract  is the leading cause of 
      reversible visual impairment with a rising global clinical burden. Improved 
      diagnosis, monitoring, and surgical management are necessary to address this 
      challenge. In addition, patients in large developing countries often suffer from 
      limited access to tertiary care, a problem further exacerbated by the ongoing 
      COVID-19 pandemic. AI on the other hand, can help transform cataract management 
      by improving automation, efficacy and overcoming geographical barriers. First, AI 
      can be applied as a telediagnostic platform to screen and diagnose patients with 
      cataract using slit-lamp and fundus photographs. This utilizes a deep-learning, 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify referable cataracts 
      appropriately. Second, some of the latest intraocular lens formulas have used AI 
      to enhance prediction accuracy, achieving superior postoperative refractive 
      results compared to traditional formulas. Third, AI can be used to augment 
      cataract surgical skill training by identifying different phases of cataract 
      surgery on video and to optimize operating theater workflows by accurately 
      predicting the duration of surgical procedures. Fourth, some AI CNN models are 
      able to effectively predict the progression of posterior capsule opacification 
      and eventual need for YAG laser capsulotomy. These advances in AI could transform 
      cataract management and enable delivery of efficient ophthalmic services. The key 
      challenges include ethical management of data, ensuring data security and 
      privacy, demonstrating clinically acceptable performance, improving the 
      generalizability of AI models across heterogeneous populations, and improving the 
      trust of end-users.

AB  - The uncertainty in predictions from deep neural network analysis of medical 
      imaging is challenging to assess but potentially important to include in 
      subsequent decision-making. Using data from diabetic retinopathy detection, we 
      present an empirical evaluation of the role of model calibration in 
      uncertainty-based referral, an approach that prioritizes referral of observations 
      based on the magnitude of a measure of uncertainty. We consider several 
      configurations of network architecture, methods for uncertainty estimation, and 
      training data size. We identify a strong relationship between the effectiveness 
      of uncertainty-based referral and having a well-calibrated model. This is 
      especially relevant as complex deep neural networks tend to have high calibration 
      errors. Finally, we show that post-calibration of the neural network helps 
      uncertainty-based referral with identifying hard-to-classify observations.

AB  - Background: Over the next 25 years, the global prevalence of diabetes is expected 
      to grow to affect 700 million individuals. Consequently, an unprecedented number 
      of patients will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye disease. This 
      demand will almost certainly exceed the supply of eye care professionals to 
      individually evaluate each patient on an annual basis, signaling the need for 
      21st century tools to assist our profession in meeting this challenge. Methods: 
      Review of available literature on artificial intelligence (AI) as applied to 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection and predictionResults: The field of AI has 
      seen exponential growth in evaluating fundus photographs for DR. AI systems 
      employ machine learning and artificial neural networks to teach themselves how to 
      grade DR from libraries of tens of thousands of images and may be able to predict 
      future DR progression based on baseline fundus photographs. Conclusions: AI 
      algorithms are highly promising for the purposes of DR detection and will likely 
      be able to reliably predict DR worsening in the future. A deeper understanding of 
      these systems and how they interpret images is critical as they transition from 
      the bench into the clinic.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye abnormality caused by long-term diabetes and 
      it is the most common cause of blindness before the age of 50. Microaneurysms 
      (MAs), resulting from leakage from retinal blood vessels, are early indicators of 
      DR. In this paper, we analyzed MA detectability using small 25 by 25 pixel 
      patches extracted from fundus images in the DIAbetic RETinopathy DataBase - 
      Calibration Level 1 (DIARETDB1). Raw pixel intensities of extracted patches 
      served directly as inputs into the following classifiers: random forest (RF), 
      neural network, and support vector machine. We also explored the use of two 
      techniques (principal component analysis and RF feature importance) for reducing 
      input dimensionality. With traditional machine learning methods and 
      leave-10-patients-out cross validation, our method outperformed a deep 
      learning-based MA detection method, with AUC performance improved from 0.962 to 
      0.985 and F-measure improved from 0.913 to 0.926, using the same DIARETDB1 
      database. Furthermore, we validated our method on a different dataset-retinopathy 
      online challenge (ROC) data set. The performance of the three classifiers and the 
      pattern with different percentage of principal components are consistent on the 
      two data sets. Especially, we trained the RF on DIARETDB1 and applied it to ROC; 
      the performance is very similar to that of the RF trained and tested using cross 
      validation on ROC data set. This result indicates that our method has the 
      potential to generalize to different datasets.

TI  - Detection of Diabetic Eye Disease from Retinal Images Using a Deep Learning Based 
      CenterNet Model.
LID - 10.3390/s21165283 [doi]
LID - 5283
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease that alters the blood vessels of a 
      person suffering from diabetes. Diabetic macular edema (DME) occurs when DR 
      affects the macula, which causes fluid accumulation in the macula. Efficient 
      screening systems require experts to manually analyze images to recognize 
      diseases. However, due to the challenging nature of the screening method and lack 
      of trained human resources, devising effective screening-oriented treatment is an 
      expensive task. Automated systems are trying to cope with these challenges; 
      however, these methods do not generalize well to multiple diseases and real-world 
      scenarios. To solve the aforementioned issues, we propose a new method comprising 
      two main steps. The first involves dataset preparation and feature extraction and 
      the other relates to improving a custom deep learning based CenterNet model 
      trained for eye disease classification. Initially, we generate annotations for 
      suspected samples to locate the precise region of interest, while the other part 
      of the proposed solution trains the Center Net model over annotated images. 
      Specifically, we use DenseNet-100 as a feature extraction method on which the 
      one-stage detector, CenterNet, is employed to localize and classify the disease 
      lesions. We evaluated our method over challenging datasets, namely, APTOS-2019 
      and IDRiD, and attained average accuracy of 97.93% and 98.10%, respectively. We 
      also performed cross-dataset validation with benchmark EYEPACS and Diaretdb1 
      datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed 
      approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods due to more effective localization 
      power of CenterNet, as it can easily recognize small lesions and deal with 
      over-fitted training data. Our proposed framework is proficient in correctly 
      locating and classifying disease lesions. In comparison to existing DR and DME 
      classification approaches, our method can extract representative key points from 
      low-intensity and noisy images and accurately classify them. Hence our approach 
      can play an important role in automated detection and recognition of DR and DME 
      lesions.

      classification.
PG  - 285-301
LID - 10.3233/XST-230252 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness. However, 
      because the data distribution of classes is not always balanced, it is 
      challenging for automated early DR detection using deep learning techniques. In 
      this paper, we propose an adaptive weighted ensemble learning method for DR 
      detection based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Specifically, we 
      develop an ensemble learning model based on three advanced deep learning models 
      for higher performance. To better utilize the cues implied in these base models, 
      a novel decision fusion scheme is proposed based on the Bayesian theory in terms 
      of the key evaluation indicators, to dynamically adjust the weighting 
      distribution of base models to alleviate the negative effects potentially caused 
      by the problem of unbalanced data size. Extensive experiments are performed on 
      two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A 
      quadratic weighted kappa of 0.8487 and an accuracy of 0.9343 on the DRAC2022 
      dataset, and a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.9007 and an accuracy of 0.8956 on 
      the APTOS2019 dataset are obtained, respectively. The results demonstrate that 
      our method has the ability to enhance the ovearall performance of DR detection on 
      OCT images.

      Dataset Through Integration of Deep Learning.
PG  - 5200-5206
LID - 10.1167/iovs.16-19964 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare performance of a deep-learning enhanced algorithm for 
      automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), to the previously published 
      performance of that algorithm, the Iowa Detection Program (IDP)-without deep 
      learning components-on the same publicly available set of fundus images and 
      previously reported consensus reference standard set, by three US Board certified 
      retinal specialists. METHODS: We used the previously reported consensus reference 
      standard of referable DR (rDR), defined as International Clinical Classification 
      of Diabetic Retinopathy moderate, severe nonproliferative (NPDR), proliferative 
      DR, and/or macular edema (ME). Neither Messidor-2 images, nor the three retinal 
      specialists setting the Messidor-2 reference standard were used for training 
      IDx-DR version X2.1. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, area 
      under the curve (AUC), and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. 
      RESULTS: Sensitivity was 96.8% (95% CI: 93.3%-98.8%), specificity was 87.0% (95% 
      CI: 84.2%-89.4%), with 6/874 false negatives, resulting in a negative predictive 
      value of 99.0% (95% CI: 97.8%-99.6%). No cases of severe NPDR, PDR, or ME were 
      missed. The AUC was 0.980 (95% CI: 0.968-0.992). Sensitivity was not 
      statistically different from published IDP sensitivity, which had a CI of 94.4% 
      to 99.3%, but specificity was significantly better than the published IDP 
      specificity CI of 55.7% to 63.0%. CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning enhanced algorithm 
      for the automated detection of DR, achieves significantly better performance than 
      a previously reported, otherwise essentially identical, algorithm that does not 
      employ deep learning. Deep learning enhanced algorithms have the potential to 
      improve the efficiency of DR screening, and thereby to prevent visual loss and 
      blindness from this devastating disease.

LID - 10.1111/cxo.12847 [doi]
AB  - Optical coherence tomography is an imaging technology that has revolutionised the 
      detection, assessment and management of ocular disease. It is now a mainstream 
      technology in clinical practice and is performed by non-specialised personnel in 
      some settings. This article provides a clinical perspective on the implications 
      of that movement and describes best practice using multimodal imaging and an 
      evidence-based approach. Practical, illustrative guides on the interpretation of 
      optical coherence tomography are provided for three major diseases of the ocular 
      fundus, in which optical coherence tomography is often crucial to management: 
      age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Topics 
      discussed include: cross-sectional and longitudinal signs in ocular disease, 
      so-called 'red-green' disease whereby clinicians rely on machine/statistical 
      comparisons for diagnosis in managing treatment-naïve patients, and the utility 
      of optical coherence tomography angiography and machine learning.

LID - 38
AB  - PURPOSE: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) permits visualization 
      of the changes to the retinal circulation due to diabetic retinopathy (DR), a 
      microvascular complication of diabetes. We demonstrate accurate segmentation of 
      the vascular morphology for the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep 
      vascular complex (DVC) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for 
      quantitative analysis. METHODS: The main CNN training dataset consisted of 
      retinal OCT-A with a 6 × 6-mm field of view (FOV), acquired using a Zeiss 
      PlexElite. Multiple-volume acquisition and averaging enhanced the vasculature 
      contrast used for constructing the ground truth for neural network training. We 
      used transfer learning from a CNN trained on smaller FOVs of the SCP acquired 
      using different OCT instruments. Quantitative analysis of perfusion was performed 
      on the resulting automated vasculature segmentations in representative patients 
      with DR. RESULTS: The automated segmentations of the OCT-A images maintained the 
      distinct morphologies of the SCP and DVC. The network segmented the SCP with an 
      accuracy and Dice index of 0.8599 and 0.8618, respectively, and 0.7986 and 
      0.8139, respectively, for the DVC. The inter-rater comparisons for the SCP had an 
      accuracy and Dice index of 0.8300 and 0.6700, respectively, and 0.6874 and 
      0.7416, respectively, for the DVC. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer learning reduces the 
      amount of manually annotated images required while producing high-quality 
      automatic segmentations of the SCP and DVC that exceed inter-rater comparisons. 
      The resulting intercapillary area quantification provides a tool for in-depth 
      clinical analysis of retinal perfusion. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Accurate retinal 
      microvasculature segmentation with the CNN results in improved perfusion analysis 
      in diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - A Hybrid Technique for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Based on Ensemble-Optimized 
      CNN and Texture Features.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13101816 [doi]
LID - 1816
AB  - One of the most prevalent chronic conditions that can result in permanent vision 
      loss is diabetic retinopathy (DR). Diabetic retinopathy occurs in five stages: no 
      DR, and mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative DR. The early detection of DR 
      is essential for preventing vision loss in diabetic patients. In this paper, we 
      propose a method for the detection and classification of DR stages to determine 
      whether patients are in any of the non-proliferative stages or in the 
      proliferative stage. The hybrid approach based on image preprocessing and 
      ensemble features is the foundation of the proposed classification method. We 
      created a convolutional neural network (CNN) model from scratch for this study. 
      Combining Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and deep learning features resulted in the 
      creation of the ensemble features vector, which was then optimized using the 
      Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA) and the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Moreover, 
      this optimized feature vector was fed to the machine learning classifiers. The 
      SVM classifier achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.85% on a 
      publicly available dataset, i.e., Kaggle EyePACS. Rigorous testing and 
      comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches in the literature indicate the 
      effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Validation of a deep learning system for the detection of diabetic retinopathy in 
      Indigenous Australians.
PG  - 268-273

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Deep learning systems (DLSs) for diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      detection show promising results but can underperform in racial and ethnic 
      minority groups, therefore external validation within these populations is 
      critical for health equity. This study evaluates the performance of a DLS for DR 
      detection among Indigenous Australians, an understudied ethnic group who suffer 
      disproportionately from DR-related blindness. METHODS: We performed a 
      retrospective external validation study comparing the performance of a DLS 
      against a retinal specialist for the detection of more-than-mild DR (mtmDR), 
      vision-threatening DR (vtDR) and all-cause referable DR. The validation set 
      consisted of 1682 consecutive, single-field, macula-centred retinal photographs 
      from 864 patients with diabetes (mean age 54.9 years, 52.4% women) at an 
      Indigenous primary care service in Perth, Australia. Three-person adjudication by 
      a panel of specialists served as the reference standard. RESULTS: For mtmDR 
      detection, sensitivity of the DLS was superior to the retina specialist (98.0% 
      (95% CI, 96.5 to 99.4) vs 87.1% (95% CI, 83.6 to 90.6), McNemar's test p<0.001) 
      with a small reduction in specificity (95.1% (95% CI, 93.6 to 96.4) vs 97.0% (95% 
      CI, 95.9 to 98.0), p=0.006). For vtDR, the DLS's sensitivity was again superior 
      to the human grader (96.2% (95% CI, 93.4 to 98.6) vs 84.4% (95% CI, 79.7 to 
      89.2), p<0.001) with a slight drop in specificity (95.8% (95% CI, 94.6 to 96.9) 
      vs 97.8% (95% CI, 96.9 to 98.6), p=0.002). For all-cause referable DR, there was 
      a substantial increase in sensitivity (93.7% (95% CI, 91.8 to 95.5) vs 74.4% (95% 
      CI, 71.1 to 77.5), p<0.001) and a smaller reduction in specificity (91.7% (95% 
      CI, 90.0 to 93.3) vs 96.3% (95% CI, 95.2 to 97.4), p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The DLS 
      showed improved sensitivity and similar specificity compared with a retina 
      specialist for DR detection. This demonstrates its potential to support DR 
      screening among Indigenous Australians, an underserved population with a high 
      burden of diabetic eye disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most prevalent 
      microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and can lead to irreversible 
      visual loss. Screening programs, based on retinal imaging techniques, are 
      fundamental to detect the disease since the initial stages are asymptomatic. Most 
      of these examinations reflect negative cases and many have poor image quality, 
      representing an important inefficiency factor. The SCREEN-DR project aims to 
      tackle this limitation, by researching and developing computer-aided methods for 
      diabetic retinopathy detection. This article presents a multidisciplinary 
      collaborative platform that was created to meet the needs of physicians and 
      researchers, aiming at the creation of machine learning algorithms to facilitate 
      the screening process. METHODS: Our proposal is a collaborative platform for 
      textual and visual annotation of image datasets. The architecture and layout were 
      optimized for annotating DR images by gathering feedback from several physicians 
      during the design and conceptualization of the platform. It allows the 
      aggregation and indexing of imagiology studies from diverse sources, and supports 
      the creation and annotation of phenotype-specific datasets to feed artificial 
      intelligence algorithms. The platform makes use of an anonymization pipeline and 
      role-based access control for securing personal data. RESULTS: The SCREEN-DR 
      platform has been deployed in the production environment of the SCREEN-DR project 
      at http://demo.dicoogle.com/screen-dr, and the source code of the project is 
      publicly available. We provide a description of the platform's interface and use 
      cases it supports. At the time of publication, four physicians have created a 
      total of 1826 annotations for 701 distinct images, and the annotated data has 
      been used for training classification models.

LID - 10.37737/ace.22009 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning refers to a series of processes in which a computer finds rules 
      from a vast amount of data. With recent advances in computer technology and the 
      availability of a wide variety of health data, machine learning has rapidly 
      developed and been applied in medical research. Currently, there are three types 
      of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In 
      medical research, supervised learning is commonly used for diagnoses and 
      prognoses, while unsupervised learning is used for phenotyping a disease, and 
      reinforcement learning for maximizing favorable results, such as optimization of 
      total patients' waiting time in the emergency department. The present article 
      focuses on the concept and application of supervised learning in medicine, the 
      most commonly used machine learning approach in medicine, and provides a brief 
      explanation of four algorithms widely used for prediction (random forests, 
      gradient-boosted decision tree, support vector machine, and neural network). 
      Among these algorithms, the neural network has further developed into deep 
      learning algorithms to solve more complex tasks. Along with simple classification 
      problems, deep learning is commonly used to process medical imaging, such as 
      retinal fundus photographs for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Although machine 
      learning can bring new insights into medicine by processing a vast amount of data 
      that are often beyond human capacity, algorithms can also fail when domain 
      knowledge is neglected. The combination of algorithms and human cognitive ability 
      is a key to the successful application of machine learning in medicine.

TI  - Computational Intelligence-Based Disease Severity Identification: A Review of 
      Multidisciplinary Domains.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13071212 [doi]
LID - 1212
AB  - Disease severity identification using computational intelligence-based approaches 
      is gaining popularity nowadays. Artificial intelligence and 
      deep-learning-assisted approaches are proving to be significant in the rapid and 
      accurate diagnosis of several diseases. In addition to disease identification, 
      these approaches have the potential to identify the severity of a disease. The 
      problem of disease severity identification can be considered multi-class 
      classification, where the class labels are the severity levels of the disease. 
      Plenty of computational intelligence-based solutions have been presented by 
      researchers for severity identification. This paper presents a comprehensive 
      review of recent approaches for identifying disease severity levels using 
      computational intelligence-based approaches. We followed the PRISMA guidelines 
      and compiled several works related to the severity identification of 
      multidisciplinary diseases of the last decade from well-known publishers, such as 
      MDPI, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, etc. This article is devoted toward the severity 
      identification of two main diseases, viz. Parkinson's Disease and Diabetic 
      Retinopathy. However, severity identification of a few other diseases, such as 
      COVID-19, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, tuberculosis, sepsis, sleep 
      apnea, psychosis, traumatic brain injury, breast cancer, knee osteoarthritis, and 
      Alzheimer's disease, was also briefly covered. Each work has been carefully 
      examined against its methodology, dataset used, and the type of disease on 
      several performance metrics, accuracy, specificity, etc. In addition to this, we 
      also presented a few public repositories that can be utilized to conduct research 
      on disease severity identification. We hope that this review not only acts as a 
      compendium but also provides insights to the researchers working on disease 
      severity identification using computational intelligence-based approaches.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is currently one of the severe complications leading to 
      blindness, and computer-aided, diagnosis technology-assisted DR grading has 
      become a popular research trend especially for the development of deep learning 
      methods. However, most deep learning-based DR grading models require a large 
      number of annotations to provide data guidance, and it is laborious for experts 
      to find subtle lesion areas from fundus images, making accurate annotation more 
      expensive than other vision tasks. In contrast, large-scale unlabeled data are 
      easily accessible, becoming a potential solution to reduce the annotating 
      workload in DR grading. Thus, this paper explores the internal correlations from 
      unknown fundus images assisted by limited labeled fundus images to solve the 
      semisupervised DR grading problem and proposes an augmentation-consistent 
      clustering network (ACCN) to address the above-mentioned challenges. 
      Specifically, the augmentation provides an efficient cue for the similarity 
      information of unlabeled fundus images, assisting the supervision from the 
      labeled data. By mining the consistent correlations from augmentation and raw 
      images, the ACCN can discover subtle lesion features by clustering with fewer 
      annotations. Experiments on Messidor and APTOS 2019 datasets show that the ACCN 
      surpasses many state-of-the-art methods in a semisupervised manner.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Using Color Retinal 
      Photographs: From Development to Deployment.
PG  - 1419-1437
LID - 10.1007/s40123-023-00691-3 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of preventable blindness, is expected 
      to remain a growing health burden worldwide. Screening to detect early 
      sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; 
      nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources 
      to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially 
      lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the 
      use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of 
      application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine 
      learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a 
      high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and 
      specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML 
      is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective 
      validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large 
      number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the 
      approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous 
      approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few 
      reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that 
      AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased 
      screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The 
      challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower 
      ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health 
      record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such 
      as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and 
      health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations 
      of using AI in the context of the country. The deployment of AI for DR screening 
      should follow the governance model for AI in healthcare which outlines four main 
      components: fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, and accountability.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology in healthcare and holds 
      the potential to disrupt many arms in medical care. In particular, disciplines 
      using medical imaging modalities, including e.g. radiology but ophthalmology as 
      well, are already confronted with a wide variety of AI implications. In 
      ophthalmologic research, AI has demonstrated promising results limited to 
      specific diseases and imaging tools, respectively. Yet, implementation of AI in 
      clinical routine is not widely spread due to availability, heterogeneity in 
      imaging techniques and AI methods. In order to describe the status quo, this 
      narrational review provides a brief introduction to AI ("what the ophthalmologist 
      needs to know"), followed by an overview of different AI-based applications in 
      ophthalmology and a discussion on future challenges.Abbreviations: Age-related

LID - 10.3233/SHTI220166 [doi]
AB  - Due to the presence of high glucose levels, diabetes mellitus (DM) is a 
      widespread disease that can damage blood vessels in the retina and lead to loss 
      of the visual system. To combat this disease, called Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), 
      retinography, using images of the fundus of the retina, is the most used method 
      for the diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy. The Deep Learning (DL) area achieved 
      high performance for the classification of retinal images and even achieved 
      almost the same human performance in diagnostic tasks. However, the performance 
      of DL architectures is highly dependent on the optimal configuration of the 
      hyperparameters. In this article, we propose the use of Neuroevolutionary 
      Algorithms to optimize the hyperparameters corresponding to the DL model for the 
      diagnosis of DR. The results obtained prove that the proposed method outperforms 
      the results obtained by the classical approach.

PG  - 1783-1788

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of a deep learning-based vascular 
      segmentation tool for UWFA and evaluate its ability to automatically identify 
      quality-optimized phase-specific images. METHODS: Cumulative retinal vessel areas 
      (RVA) were extracted from all available UWFA frames. Cubic splines were fitted 
      for serial vascular assessment throughout the angiographic phases of eyes with 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), or normal retinal 
      vasculature. The image with maximum RVA was selected as the optimum early phase. 
      A late phase frame was selected at a minimum of 4 min that most closely mirrored 
      the RVA from the selected early image. Trained image analysts evaluated the 
      selected pairs. RESULTS: A total of 13,980 UWFA sequences from 462 sessions were 
      used to evaluate the performance and 1578 UWFA sequences from 66 sessions were 
      used to create cubic splines. Maximum RVA was detected at a mean of 41 ± 15, 
      47 ± 27, 38 ± 8 s for DR, SCR, and normals respectively. In 85.2% of the 
      sessions, appropriate images for both phases were successfully identified. The 
      individual success rate was 90.7% for early and 94.6% for late frames. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vascular characteristics are highly phased and field-of-view 
      sensitive. Vascular parameters extracted by deep learning algorithms can be used 
      for quality assessment of angiographic images and quality optimized phase 
      selection. Clinical applications of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation 
      and phase selection system might significantly improve the speed, consistency,

TI  - Variability of Grading DR Screening Images among Non-Trained Retina Specialists.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11113125 [doi]
LID - 3125
AB  - Poland has never had a widespread diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program and 
      subsequently has no purpose-trained graders and no established grader training 
      scheme. Herein, we compare the performance and variability of three retinal 
      specialists with no additional DR grading training in assessing images from 335 
      real-life screening encounters and contrast their performance against IDx-DR, a 
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved DR screening suite. A total of 
      1501 fundus images from 670 eyes were assessed by each grader with a final grade 
      on a per-eye level. Unanimous agreement between all graders was achieved for 385 
      eyes, and 110 patients, out of which 98% had a final grade of no DR. Thirty-six 
      patients had final grades higher than mild DR, out of which only two had no 
      grader disagreements regarding severity. A total of 28 eyes underwent 
      adjudication due to complete grader disagreement. Four patients had discordant 
      grades ranging from no DR to severe DR between the human graders and IDx-DR. 
      Retina specialists achieved kappa scores of 0.52, 0.78, and 0.61. Retina 
      specialists had relatively high grader variability and only a modest concordance 
      with IDx-DR results. Focused training and verification are recommended for any 
      potential DR graders before assessing DR screening images.

TI  - Optical Coherence Tomography Image Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning and 
      Ant Colony Optimization.
LID - 10.3390/s23156706 [doi]
LID - 6706
AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used to detect and classify retinal 
      diseases. However, OCT-image-based manual detection by ophthalmologists is prone 
      to errors and subjectivity. Thus, various automation methods have been proposed; 
      however, improvements in detection accuracy are required. Particularly, automated 
      techniques using deep learning on OCT images are being developed to detect 
      various retinal disorders at an early stage. Here, we propose a deep 
      learning-based automatic method for detecting and classifying retinal diseases 
      using OCT images. The diseases include age-related macular degeneration, branch 
      retinal vein occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, central serous 
      chorioretinopathy, and diabetic macular edema. The proposed method comprises four 
      main steps: three pretrained models, DenseNet-201, InceptionV3, and ResNet-50, 
      are first modified according to the nature of the dataset, after which the 
      features are extracted via transfer learning. The extracted features are 
      improved, and the best features are selected using ant colony optimization. 
      Finally, the best features are passed to the k-nearest neighbors and support 
      vector machine algorithms for final classification. The proposed method, 
      evaluated using OCT retinal images collected from Soonchunhyang University 
      Bucheon Hospital, demonstrates an accuracy of 99.1% with the incorporation of 
      ACO. Without ACO, the accuracy achieved is 97.4%. Furthermore, the proposed 
      method exhibits state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing techniques 
      in terms of accuracy.

TI  - [ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN OPHTHALMOLOGY].
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) was first introduced in 1956, and effectively 
      represents the fourth industrial revolution in human history. Over time, this 
      medium has evolved to be the preferred method of medical imagery interpretation. 
      Today, the implementation of AI in the medical field as a whole, and the 
      ophthalmological field in particular, is diverse and includes diagnose, follow-up 
      and monitoring of the progression of ocular diseases. For example, AI algorithms 
      can identify ectasia, and pre-clinical signs of keratoconus, using images and 
      information computed from various corneal maps. Machine learning (ML) is a 
      specific technique for implementing AI. It is defined as a series of automated 
      methods that identify patterns and templates in data and leverage these to 
      perform predictions on new data. This technology was first applied in the 1980s. 
      Deep learning is an advanced form of ML inspired by and designed to imitate the 
      human brain process, constructed of layers, each responsible for identifying 
      patterns, thereby successfully modeling complex scenarios. The significant 
      advantage of ML in medicine is in its' ability to monitor and follow patients 
      with efficiency at a low cost. Deep learning is utilized to monitor ocular 
      diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      glaucoma, cataract, and retinopathy of prematurity. These conditions, as well as 
      others, require frequent follow-up in order to track changes over time. Though 
      computer technology is important for identifying and grading various ocular 
      diseases, it still necessitates additional clinical validation and does not 
      entirely replace human diagnostic skill.

AB  - We review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the 
      screening, diagnosis, and classification of diabetic macular edema (DME) by 
      searching six databases- PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, IEEE, 
      and ACM- from January 1, 2005 to July 4, 2021. A total of 879 articles were 
      extracted, and by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles were 
      selected for more evaluation. The methodological quality of included studies was 
      evaluated using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 
      (QUADAS-2). We provide an overview of the current state of various AI techniques 
      for DME screening, diagnosis, and classification using retinal imaging modalities 
      such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP). 
      Based on our findings, deep learning models have an extraordinary capacity to 
      provide an accurate and efficient system for DME screening and diagnosis. Using 
      these in the processing of modalities leads to a significant increase in 
      sensitivity and specificity values. The use of decision support systems and 
      applications based on AI in processing retinal images provided by OCT and CFP 
      increases the sensitivity and specificity in DME screening and detection.

      EyePACS dataset were used. Four DAL approaches [entropy sampling (ES), Bayesian 
      active learning by disagreement (BALD), core set, and adversarial active learning 
      (ADV)] were compared to conventional naive random sampling. Models were compared 
      at various dataset sizes using Cohen's kappa (CK) and area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve on an internal test set of 10,000 images. An 
      independent test set of 3662 fundus photographs was used to assess 
      generalizability. RESULTS: On the internal test set, 3 out of 4 DAL methods 
      resulted in statistically significant performance improvements ( p < 1 × 10-4 ) 
      compared to random sampling for multiclass classification, with the largest 
      observed differences in CK ranging from 0.051 for BALD to 0.053 for ES. 
      Improvements in multiclass classification generalized to the independent test 
      set, with the largest differences in CK ranging from 0.126 to 0.135. However, no 
      statistically significant improvements were seen for binary classification. 
      Similar performance was seen across DAL methods, except ADV, which performed 
      similarly to random sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty-based and feature 
      descriptor-based deep active learning methods outperformed random sampling on 
      both the internal and independent test sets at multiclass classification. 
      However, binary classification performance remained similar across random 
      sampling and active learning methods.

AB  - Diagnosis retinal abnormalities in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images 
      assist ophthalmologist in the early detection and treatment of patients. To do 
      this, different Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods based on machine learning 
      and deep learning algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, wavelet 
      scattering network is used to identify normal retina and four pathologies namely, 
      Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR), Macular Hole (MH), Age-related Macular 
      Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Wavelet scattering network is a 
      particular convolutional network which is formed from cascading wavelet transform 
      with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. This transform generates sparse, 
      translation invariant and deformation stable representations of signals. Filters 
      in the layers of this network are predefined wavelets and not need to be learned 
      which causes decreasing the processing time and complexity. The extracted 
      features are fed to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) classifier. The results 
      of this research show the accuracy of 97.4% and 100% in diagnosis abnormal retina 
      and DR from normal ones, respectively. We also achieved the accuracy of 84.2% in 
      classifying OCT images to five classes of normal, CSR, MH, AMD and DR which 
      outperforms other state of the art methods with high computational complexity. 
      Clinical Relevance- Clinically, the manually checking of each OCT B-scan by 
      ophthalmologists is tedious and time consuming and may lead to an erroneous 
      decision specially for multiclass problems. In this study, a low complexity CAD 
      system for retinal OCT image classification based on wavelet scattering network 
      is introduced which can be learned by a small number of data.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare supervised transfer learning to semisupervised learning for 
      their ability to learn in-depth knowledge with limited data in the optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) domain. METHODS: Transfer learning with 
      EfficientNet-B4 and semisupervised learning with SimCLR are used in this work. 
      The largest public OCT dataset, consisting of 108,312 images and four categories 
      (choroidal neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, drusen, and normal) is 
      used. In addition, two smaller datasets are constructed, containing 31,200 images 
      for the limited version and 4000 for the mini version of the dataset. To 
      illustrate the effectiveness of the developed models, local interpretable 
      model-agnostic explanations and class activation maps are used as explainability 
      techniques. RESULTS: The proposed transfer learning approach using the 
      EfficientNet-B4 model trained on the limited dataset achieves an accuracy of 
      0.976 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.963, 0.983), sensitivity of 0.973 and 
      specificity of 0.991. The semisupervised based solution with SimCLR using 10% 
      labeled data and the limited dataset performs with an accuracy of 0.946 (95% CI, 
      0.932, 0.960), sensitivity of 0.941, and specificity of 0.983. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Semisupervised learning has a huge potential for datasets that contain both 
      labeled and unlabeled inputs, generally, with a significantly smaller number of 
      labeled samples. The semisupervised based solution provided with merely 10% 
      labeled data achieves very similar performance to the supervised transfer 
      learning that uses 100% labeled samples. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Semisupervised 
      learning enables building performant models while requiring less expertise effort 
      and time by using to good advantage the abundant amount of available unlabeled 
      data along with the labeled samples.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common retinal vascular diseases and 
      one of the main causes of blindness worldwide. Early detection and treatment can 
      effectively delay vision decline and even blindness in patients with DR. In 
      recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) models constructed by machine learning 
      and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely used in ophthalmology 
      research, especially in diagnosing and treating ophthalmic diseases, particularly 
      DR. Regarding DR, AI has mainly been used in its diagnosis, grading, and lesion 
      recognition and segmentation, and good research and application results have been 
      achieved. This study summarizes the research progress in AI models based on 
      machine learning and DL algorithms for DR diagnosis and discusses some 
      limitations and challenges in AI research.

LID - 10.1177/19322968211042665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical image segmentation is a well-studied subject within the field 
      of image processing. The goal of this research is to create an AI retinal 
      screening grading system that is both accurate and fast. We introduce a new 
      segmentation network which achieves state-of-the-art results on semantic 
      segmentation of color fundus photographs. By applying the net-work to identify 
      anatomical markers of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), 
      we collect sufficient information to classify patients by grades R0 and R1 or 
      above, M0 and M1. METHODS: The AI grading system was trained on screening data to 
      evaluate the presence of DR and DME. The core algorithm of the system is a deep 
      learning network that segments relevant anatomical features in a retinal image. 
      Patients were graded according to the standard NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Program 
      feature-based grading protocol. RESULTS: The algorithm performance was evaluated 
      with a series of 6,981 patient retinal images from routine diabetic eye 
      screenings. It correctly predicted 98.9% of retinopathy events and 95.5% of 
      maculopathy events. Non-disease events prediction rate was 68.6% for retinopathy 
      and 81.2% for maculopathy. CONCLUSION: This novel deep learning model was trained 
      and tested on patient data from annual diabetic retinopathy screenings can 
      classify with high accuracy the DR and DME status of a person with diabetes. The 
      system can be easily reconfigured according to any grading protocol, without 
      running a long AI training procedure. The incorporation of the AI grading system 
      can increase the graders' productivity and improve the final outcome accuracy of 
      the screening process.

TI  - The Role of Different Retinal Imaging Modalities in Predicting Progression of 
      Diabetic Retinopathy: A Survey.
LID - 10.3390/s22093490 [doi]
LID - 3490
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a devastating condition caused by progressive 
      changes in the retinal microvasculature. It is a leading cause of retinal 
      blindness in people with diabetes. Long periods of uncontrolled blood sugar 
      levels result in endothelial damage, leading to macular edema, altered retinal 
      permeability, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization. In order to facilitate 
      rapid screening and diagnosing, as well as grading of DR, different retinal 
      modalities are utilized. Typically, a computer-aided diagnostic system (CAD) uses 
      retinal images to aid the ophthalmologists in the diagnosis process. These CAD 
      systems use a combination of machine learning (ML) models (e.g., deep learning 
      (DL) approaches) to speed up the diagnosis and grading of DR. In this way, this 
      survey provides a comprehensive overview of different imaging modalities used 
      with ML/DL approaches in the DR diagnosis process. The four imaging modalities 
      that we focused on are fluorescein angiography, fundus photographs, optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA). In addition, we discuss 
      limitations of the literature that utilizes such modalities for DR diagnosis. In 
      addition, we introduce research gaps and provide suggested solutions for the 
      researchers to resolve. Lastly, we provide a thorough discussion about the 
      challenges and future directions of the current state-of-the-art DL/ML 
      approaches. We also elaborate on how integrating different imaging modalities 
      with the clinical information and demographic data will lead to promising results 
      for the scientists when diagnosing and grading DR. As a result of this article's 
      comparative analysis and discussion, it remains necessary to use DL methods over 
      existing ML models to detect DR in multiple modalities.

AB  - A medical disorder known as diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects people who suffer 
      from diabetes. Many people are visually impaired due to DR. Primary cause of DR 
      in patients is high blood sugar, and it affects blood vessels available in the 
      retinal cell. The recent advancement in deep learning and computer vision 
      methods, and their automation applications can recognize the presence of DR in 
      retinal cells and vessel images. Authors have proposed an attention-based hybrid 
      model to recognize diabetes in early stage to prevent harmful clauses. Proposed 
      methodology uses DenseNet121 architecture for convolution learning and then, the 
      feature vector will be enhanced with channel and spatial attention model. The 
      proposed architecture also simulates binary and multiclass classification to 
      recognize the infection and the spreading of disease. Binary classification 
      recognizes DR images either positive or negative, while multiclass classification 
      represents an infection on a scale of 0-4. Simulation of the proposed methodology 
      has achieved 98.57% and 99.01% accuracy for multiclass and binary classification, 
      respectively. Simulation of the study also explored the impact of data 
      augmentation to make the proposed model robust and generalized. Attention-based 
      deep learning model has achieved remarkable accuracy to detect diabetic infection 
      from retinal cellular images.

AB  - Retinal fundus photographs can be used to detect a range of retinal conditions. 
      Here we show that deep-learning models trained instead on external photographs of 
      the eyes can be used to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular oedema 
      and poor blood glucose control. We developed the models using eye photographs 
      from 145,832 patients with diabetes from 301 DR screening sites and evaluated the 
      models on four tasks and four validation datasets with a total of 48,644 patients 
      from 198 additional screening sites. For all four tasks, the predictive 
      performance of the deep-learning models was significantly higher than the 
      performance of logistic regression models using self-reported demographic and 
      medical history data, and the predictions generalized to patients with dilated 
      pupils, to patients from a different DR screening programme and to a general eye 
      care programme that included diabetics and non-diabetics. We also explored the 
      use of the deep-learning models for the detection of elevated lipid levels. The 
      utility of external eye photographs for the diagnosis and management of diseases 
      should be further validated with images from different cameras and patient 
      populations.

AB  - We sought to evaluate the performance of machine learning prediction models for 
      identifying vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) in patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus using only medical data from data warehouse. This is a 
      multicenter electronic medical records review study. Patients with type 2 
      diabetes screened for diabetic retinopathy and followed-up for 10 years were 
      included from six referral hospitals sharing same electronic medical record 
      system (n = 9,102). Patient demographics, laboratory results, visual acuities 
      (VAs), and occurrence of VTDR were collected. Prediction models for VTDR were 
      developed using machine learning models. F1 score, accuracy, specificity, and 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were analyzed. 
      Machine learning models revealed F1 score, accuracy, specificity, and AUC values 
      of up 0.89, 0.89.0.95, and 0.96 during training. The trained models predicted the 
      occurrence of VTDR at 10-year with F1 score, accuracy, and specificity up to 
      0.81, 0.70, and 0.66, respectively, on test set. Important predictors included 
      baseline VA, duration of diabetes treatment, serum level of glycated hemoglobin 
      and creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure. The 
      models could predict the long-term occurrence of VTDR with fair performance. 
      Although there might be limitation due to lack of funduscopic findings, 
      prediction models trained using medical data can facilitate proper referral of 
      subjects at high risk for VTDR to an ophthalmologist from primary care.

TI  - Analysis and Comparison of Two Artificial Intelligence Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Screening Algorithms in a Pilot Study: IDx-DR and Retinalyze.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10112352 [doi]
LID - 2352
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is expected to increase. 
      This will put an increasing strain on health care resources. Recently, artificial 
      intelligence-based, autonomous DR screening systems have been developed. A direct 
      comparison between different systems is often difficult and only two such 
      comparisons have been published so far. As different screening solutions are now 
      available commercially, with more in the pipeline, choosing a system is not a 
      simple matter. Based on the images gathered in a local DR screening program we 
      performed a retrospective comparison of IDx-DR and Retinalyze. METHODS: We chose 
      a non-representative sample of all referable DR positive screening subjects (n = 
      60) and a random selection of DR negative patient images (n = 110). Only subjects 
      with four good quality, 45-degree field of view images, a macula-centered and 
      disc-centered image from both eyes were chosen for comparison. The images were 
      captured by a Topcon NW-400 fundus camera, without mydriasis. The images were 
      previously graded by a single ophthalmologist. For the purpose of this 
      comparison, we assumed two screening strategies for Retinalyze-where either one 
      or two out of the four images needed to be marked positive by the system for an 
      overall positive result at the patient level. RESULTS: Percentage agreement with 
      a single reader in DR positive and DR negative cases respectively was: 93.3%, 
      95.5% for IDx-DR; 89.7% and 71.8% for Retinalyze strategy 1; 74.1% and 93.6% for 
      Retinalyze under strategy 2. CONCLUSIONS: Both systems were able to analyse the 
      vast majority of images. Both systems were easy to set up and use. There were 
      several limitations to the current pilot study, concerning sample choice and the 
      reference grading that need to be addressed before attempting a more robust 
      future study.

      optic neuritis, paralysis of the eye muscles, or various retinal damages over 
      time. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common form of blindness that occurs with 
      diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is a disease that occurs when the blood vessels in 
      the retina of the eye become damaged, leading to loss of vision in advanced 
      stages. This disease can occur in any diabetic patient, and the most important 
      factor in treating the disease is early diagnosis. Nowadays, deep learning models 
      and machine learning methods, which are open to technological developments, are 
      already used in early diagnosis systems. In this study, two publicly available 
      datasets were used. The datasets consist of five types according to the severity 
      of diabetic retinopathy. The objectives of the proposed approach in diabetic 
      retinopathy detection are to positively contribute to the performance of CNN 
      models by processing fundus images through preprocessing steps (morphological 
      gradient and segmentation approaches). The other goal is to detect efficient sets 
      from type-based activation sets obtained from CNN models using Atom Search 
      Optimization method and increase the classification success. METHODS: The 
      proposed approach consists of three steps. In the first step, the Morphological 
      Gradient method is used to prevent parasitism in each image, and the ocular 
      vessels in fundus images are extracted using the segmentation method. In the 
      second step, the datasets are trained with transfer learning models and the 
      activations for each class type in the last fully connected layers of these 
      models are extracted. In the last step, the Atom Search optimization method is 
      used, and the most dominant activation class is selected from the extracted 
      activations on a class basis. RESULTS: When classified by the severity of 
      diabetic retinopathy, an overall accuracy of 99.59% was achieved for dataset #1 
      and 99.81% for dataset #2. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that the 
      overall accuracy achieved with the proposed approach increased. To achieve this 
      increase, the application of preprocessing steps and the selection of the 
      dominant activation sets from the deep learning models were implemented using the 
      Atom Search optimization method.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus has been regarded as one of the prime health issues in present 
      days, which can often lead to diabetic retinopathy, a complication of the disease 
      that affects the eyes, causing loss of vision. For precisely detecting the 
      condition's existence, clinicians are required to recognise the presence of 
      lesions in colour fundus images, making it an arduous and time-consuming task. To 
      deal with this problem, a lot of work has been undertaken to develop deep 
      learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems that assist clinicians in making 
      accurate diagnoses of the diseases in medical images. Contrariwise, the basic 
      operations involved in deep learning models lead to the extraction of a bulky set 
      of features, further taking a long period of training to predict the existence of 
      the disease. For effective execution of these models, feature selection becomes 
      an important task that aids in selecting the most appropriate features, with an 
      aim to increase the classification accuracy. This research presents an optimised 
      deep k-nearest neighbours'-based pipeline model in a bid to amalgamate the 
      feature extraction capability of deep learning models with nature-inspired 
      metaheuristic algorithms, further using k-nearest neighbour algorithm for 
      classification. The proposed model attains an accuracy of 97.67 and 98.05% on two 
      different datasets considered, outperforming Resnet50 and AlexNet deep learning 
      models. Additionally, the experimental results also portray an analysis of five 
      different nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, considered for feature 
      selection on the basis of various evaluation parameters.

AB  - It is now clear that retinal neuropathy precedes classical microvascular 
      retinopathy in diabetes. Therefore, tests that underpin useful new endpoints must 
      provide high diagnostic power well before the onset of moderate diabetic 
      retinopathy. Hence, we compare detection methods of early diabetic eye damage. We 
      reviewed data from a range of functional and structural studies of early diabetic 
      eye disease and computed standardized effect size as a measure of diagnostic 
      power, allowing the studies to be compared quantitatively. We then derived 
      minimum performance criteria for tests to provide useful clinical endpoints. This 
      included the criteria that tests should be rapid and easy so that children with 
      type 1 diabetes can be followed into adulthood with the same tests. We also 
      defined attributes that lend test data to further improve performance using 
      Machine/Deep Learning. Data from a new form of objective perimetry suggested that 
      the criteria are achievable.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a serious microvascular disorder that might result in 
      loss of vision and blindness. It seriously damages the retinal blood vessels and 
      reduces the light-sensitive inner layer of the eye. Due to the manual inspection 
      of retinal fundus images on diabetic retinopathy to detect the morphological 
      abnormalities in Microaneurysms (MAs), Exudates (EXs), Haemorrhages (HMs), and 
      Inter retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) is very difficult and time 
      consuming process. In order to avoid this, the regular follow-up screening 
      process, and early automatic Diabetic Retinopathy detection are necessary. This 
      paper discusses various methods of analysing automatic retinopathy detection and 
      classification of different grading based on the severity levels. In addition, 
      retinal blood vessel detection techniques are also discussed for the ultimate 
      detection and diagnostic procedure of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
      Furthermore, the paper elaborately discussed the systematic review accessed by 
      authors on various publicly available databases collected from different medical 
      sources. In the survey, meta-analysis of several methods for diabetic feature 
      extraction, segmentation and various types of classifiers have been used to 
      evaluate the system performance metrics for the diagnosis of DR. This survey will 
      be helpful for the technical persons and researchers who want to focus on 
      enhancing the diagnosis of a system that would be more powerful in real life.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes disorder that disturbs human vision. It 
      starts due to the damage in the light-sensitive tissues of blood vessels at the 
      retina. In the beginning, DR may show no symptoms or only slight vision issues, 
      but in the long run, it could be a permanent source of impaired vision, simply 
      known as blindness in the advanced as well as in developing nations. This could 
      be prevented if DR is identified early enough, but it can be challenging as we 
      know the disease frequently shows rare signs until it is too late to deliver an 
      effective cure. In our work, we recommend a framework for severity grading and 
      early DR detection through hybrid deep learning Inception-ResNet architecture 
      with smart data preprocessing. Our proposed method is composed of three steps. 
      Firstly, the retinal images are preprocessed with the help of augmentation and 
      intensity normalization. Secondly, the preprocessed images are given to the 
      hybrid Inception-ResNet architecture to extract the vector image features for the 
      categorization of different stages. Lastly, to identify DR and decide its stage 
      (e.g., mild DR, moderate DR, severe DR, or proliferative DR), a classification 
      step is used. The studies and trials have to reveal suitable outcomes when 
      equated with some other previously deployed approaches. However, there are 
      specific constraints in our study that are also discussed and we suggest methods 
      to enhance further research in this field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) produces bleeding, exudation, and new blood 
      vessel formation conditions. DR can damage the retinal blood vessels and cause 
      vision loss or even blindness. If DR is detected early, ophthalmologists can use 
      lasers to create tiny burns around the retinal tears to inhibit bleeding and 
      prevent the formation of new blood vessels, in order to prevent deterioration of 
      the disease. The rapid improvement of deep learning has made image recognition an 
      effective technology; it can avoid misjudgments caused by different doctors' 
      evaluations and help doctors to predict the condition quickly. The aim of this 
      paper is to adopt visualization and preprocessing in the ResNet-50 model to 
      improve module calibration, to enable the model to predict DR accurately. 
      RESULTS: This study compared the performance of the proposed method with other 
      common CNNs models (Xception, AlexNet, VggNet-s, VggNet-16 and ResNet-50). In 
      examining said models, the results alluded to an over-fitting phenomenon, and the 
      outcome of the work demonstrates that the performance of the revised ResNet-50 
      (Train accuracy: 0.8395 and Test accuracy: 0.7432) is better than other common 
      CNNs (that is, the revised structure of ResNet-50 could avoid the overfitting 
      problem, decease the loss value, and reduce the fluctuation problem). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study proposed two approaches to designing the DR grading 
      system: a standard operation procedure (SOP) for preprocessing the fundus image, 
      and a revised structure of ResNet-50, including an adaptive learning rating to 
      adjust the weight of layers, regularization and change the structure of 
      ResNet-50, which was selected for its suitable features. It is worth noting that 
      the purpose of this study was not to design the most accurate DR screening 
      network, but to demonstrate the effect of the SOP of DR and the visualization of 
      the revised ResNet-50 model. The results provided an insight to revise the 
      structure of CNNs using the visualization tool.

AB  - Screening effectively identifies patients at risk of sight-threatening diabetic 
      retinopathy (STDR) when retinal images are captured through dilated pupils. 
      Pharmacological mydriasis is not logistically feasible in non-clinical, community 
      DR screening, where acquiring gradable retinal images using handheld devices 
      exhibits high technical failure rates, reducing STDR detection. Deep learning 
      (DL) based gradability predictions at acquisition could prompt device operators 
      to recapture insufficient quality images, increasing gradable image proportions 
      and consequently STDR detection. Non-mydriatic retinal images were captured as 
      part of SMART India, a cross-sectional, multi-site, community-based, 
      house-to-house DR screening study between August 2018 and December 2019 using the 
      Zeiss Visuscout 100 handheld camera. From 18,277 patient eyes (40,126 images), 
      16,170 patient eyes (35,319 images) were eligible and 3261 retinal images (1490 
      patient eyes) were sampled then labelled by two ophthalmologists. Compact DL 
      model area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.93 (0.01) 
      following five-fold cross-validation. Compact DL model agreement (Kappa) were 
      0.58, 0.69 and 0.69 for high specificity, balanced sensitivity/specificity and 
      high sensitivity operating points compared to an inter-grader agreement of 0.59. 
      Compact DL gradability model performance was favourable compared to 
      ophthalmologists. Compact DL models can effectively classify non-mydriatic, 
      handheld retinal image gradability with potential applications within 
      community-based DR screening.

TI  - Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Electronic Health Record Data in 
      Ophthalmology.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1167/tvst.9.2.13 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the 
      collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, 
      the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet 
      making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and 
      facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the 
      complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
      techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While 
      AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited 
      number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The 
      objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods 
      applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review 
      highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic 
      retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI 
      techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, 
      risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised 
      machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most 
      commonly used in the articles reviewed.

LID - 463
AB  - We show that deep convolutional neural networks combined with nonlinear dimension 
      reduction enable reconstructing biological processes based on raw image data. We 
      demonstrate this by reconstructing the cell cycle of Jurkat cells and disease 
      progression in diabetic retinopathy. In further analysis of Jurkat cells, we 
      detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells in an unsupervised manner and, 
      in classifying discrete cell cycle stages, we reach a sixfold reduction in error 
      rate compared to a recent approach based on boosting on image features. In 
      contrast to previous methods, deep learning based predictions are fast enough for 
      on-the-fly analysis in an imaging flow cytometer.The interpretation of 
      information-rich, high-throughput single-cell data is a challenge requiring 
      sophisticated computational tools. Here the authors demonstrate a deep 
      convolutional neural network that can classify cell cycle status on-the-fly.

TI  - Etiology of Macular Edema Defined by Deep Learning in Optical Coherence 
      Tomography Scans.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.9.29 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop an automated method based on deep learning (DL) to classify 
      macular edema (ME) from the evaluation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      scans. METHODS: A total of 4230 images were obtained from data repositories of 
      patients attended in an ophthalmology clinic in Colombia and two free open-access 
      databases. They were annotated with four biomarkers (BMs) as intraretinal fluid, 
      subretinal fluid, hyperreflective foci/tissue, and drusen. Then the scans were 
      labeled as control or ocular disease among diabetic macular edema (DME), 
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), and retinal vein occlusion 
      (RVO) by two expert ophthalmologists. Our method was developed by following four 
      consecutive phases: segmentation of BMs, the combination of BMs, feature 
      extraction with convolutional neural networks to achieve binary classification 
      for each disease, and, finally, multiclass classification of diseases and control 
      images. RESULTS: The accuracy of our model for nAMD was 97%, and for DME, RVO, 
      and control were 94%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. Area under curve values were 
      0.99, 0.98, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. The mean Cohen's kappa coefficient for 
      the multiclass classification task was 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DL model 
      may identify OCT scans as normal and ME. In addition, it may classify its cause 
      among three major exudative retinal diseases with high accuracy and reliability. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Our DL approach can optimize the efficiency and 
      timeliness of appropriate etiological diagnosis of ME, thus improving patient 
      access and clinical decision making. It could be useful in places with a shortage 
      of specialists and for readers that evaluate OCT scans remotely.

TI  - UD-MIL: Uncertainty-Driven Deep Multiple Instance Learning for OCT Image 
      Classification.
PG  - 3431-3442
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2983730 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) image classification task with substantial labelled B-scan images 
      available. However, obtaining such fine-grained expert annotations is usually 
      quite difficult and expensive. How to leverage the volume-level labels to develop 
      a robust classifier is very appealing. In this paper, we propose a weakly 
      supervised deep learning framework with uncertainty estimation to address the 
      macula-related disease classification problem from OCT images with the only 
      volume-level label being available. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      based instance-level classifier is iteratively refined by using the proposed 
      uncertainty-driven deep multiple instance learning scheme. To our best knowledge, 
      we are the first to incorporate the uncertainty evaluation mechanism into 
      multiple instance learning (MIL) for training a robust instance classifier. The 
      classifier is able to detect suspicious abnormal instances and abstract the 
      corresponding deep embedding with high representation capability simultaneously. 
      Second, a recurrent neural network (RNN) takes instance features from the same 
      bag as input and generates the final bag-level prediction by considering the 
      individually local instance information and globally aggregated bag-level 
      representation. For more comprehensive validation, we built two large diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) OCT datasets from different devices and imaging protocols to 
      evaluate the efficacy of our method, which are composed of 30,151 B-scans in 
      1,396 volumes from 274 patients (Heidelberg-DME dataset) and 38,976 B-scans in 
      3,248 volumes from 490 patients (Triton-DME dataset), respectively. We compare 
      the proposed method with the state-of-the-art approaches, and experimentally 
      demonstrate that our method is superior to alternative methods, achieving 
      volume-level accuracy, F1-score and area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.1%, 0.939 and 0.990 on Heidelberg-DME and those 
      of 95.1%, 0.935 and 0.986 on Triton-DME, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed 
      method also yields competitive results on another public age-related macular 
      degeneration OCT dataset, indicating the high potential as an effective screening 
      tool in the clinical practice.

TI  - A digital online platform for education and certification of diabetic retinopathy 
      health care professionals in the Region of Southern Denmark.

AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of diabetes continues to increase across the world. As the 
      number of patients rises, so does the need for educated health care 
      professionals. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains one of the primary complications 
      in diabetes, and screening has proved to be a cost-effective measure to avoid 
      DR-related blindness. Denmark has an established screening programme, but no 
      formal training of the people responsible for analysing retinal images. METHODS: 
      We here present an online learning platform that offers a diabetic eye screening 
      course for health care professionals undertaking screening responsibility in the 
      Region of Southern Denmark. The course is divided into lectures, each focussed on 
      identifying different levels of DR or detecting related lesions. The course is 
      free to use on-demand, contains instructional videos, interactive tests and 
      exercises, and it is concluded with a certification test. The tools on the 
      platform can in addition be used to generate data for research purposes, such as 
      comparing users or experts in detection of lesions or annotating data for the 
      development of machine learning models. RESULTS: More than 150 participants have 
      so far completed the course, and the platform is being adopted for education in 
      other regions of Denmark.

TI  - Identifying Diabetic Retinopathy in the Human Eye: A Hybrid Approach Based on a 
      Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Combined with Deep Learning.
PG  - 215-230
LID - 10.3390/tomography10020017 [doi]
AB  - Diagnosing and screening for diabetic retinopathy is a well-known issue in the 
      biomedical field. A component of computer-aided diagnosis that has advanced 
      significantly over the past few years as a result of the development and 
      effectiveness of deep learning is the use of medical imagery from a patient's eye 
      to identify the damage caused to blood vessels. Issues with unbalanced datasets, 
      incorrect annotations, a lack of sample images, and improper performance 
      evaluation measures have negatively impacted the performance of deep learning 
      models. Using three benchmark datasets of diabetic retinopathy, we conducted a 
      detailed comparison study comparing various state-of-the-art approaches to 
      address the effect caused by class imbalance, with precision scores of 93%, 89%, 
      81%, 76%, and 96%, respectively, for normal, mild, moderate, severe, and DR 
      phases. The analyses of the hybrid modeling, including CNN analysis and SHAP 
      model derivation results, are compared at the end of the paper, and ideal hybrid 
      modeling strategies for deep learning classification models for automated DR 
      detection are identified.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration are leading 
      causes of vision loss and blindness worldwide. They tend to be asymptomatic in 
      the early phase of disease and therefore require active screening programs to 
      identify the patients requiring referral and treatment. Deep learning-based 
      artificial intelligence technology has recently become a major topic in the field 
      of ophthalmology. This paper aimed to provide a general view of the major 
      findings on the application of deep learning for the classification of eye 
      diseases from common imaging modalities. In the future, it is expected that these 
      technologies will be applied in real-world screening programs to improve their 
      efficiency and affordability.

LID - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Applications for artificial intelligence (AI) in ophthalmology are 
      continually evolving. Fundoscopy is one of the oldest ocular imaging techniques 
      but remains a mainstay in posterior segment imaging due to its prevalence, ease 
      of use, and ongoing technological advancement. AI has been leveraged for 
      fundoscopy to accomplish core tasks including segmentation, classification, and 
      prediction. MAIN BODY: In this article we provide a review of AI in fundoscopy 
      applied to representative chorioretinal pathologies, including diabetic 
      retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, among others. We conclude with 
      a discussion of future directions and current limitations. SHORT CONCLUSION: As 
      AI evolves, it will become increasingly essential for the modern ophthalmologist 
      to understand its applications and limitations to improve patient outcomes and 
      continue to innovate.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness and affects millions of 
      people throughout the world. Early detection and timely checkups are key to 
      reduce the risk of blindness. Automated grading of DR is a cost-effective way to 
      ensure early detection and timely checkups. Deep learning or more specifically 
      convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods produce state-of-the-art 
      performance in DR detection. Whilst CNN based methods have been proposed, no 
      comparisons have been done between the extracted image features and their 
      clinical relevance. Here we first adopt a CNN visualization strategy to discover 
      the inherent image features involved in the CNN's decision-making process. Then, 
      we critically analyze those features with respect to commonly known pathologies 
      namely microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates, and other ocular components. We 
      also critically analyze different CNNs by considering what image features they 
      pick up during learning to predict and justify their clinical relevance. The 
      experiments are executed on publicly available fundus datasets (EyePACS and 
      DIARETDB1) achieving an accuracy of 89 ~ 95% with AUC, sensitivity and 
      specificity of respectively 95 ~ 98%, 74 ~ 86%, and 93 ~ 97%, for disease level 
      grading of DR. Whilst different CNNs produce consistent classification results, 
      the rate of picked-up image features disagreement between models could be as high 
      as 70%.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) represents a highly-prevalent complication of diabetes 
      in which individuals suffer from damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The 
      disease manifests itself through lesion presence, starting with microaneurysms, 
      at the nonproliferative stage before being characterized by neovascularization in 
      the proliferative stage. Retinal specialists strive to detect DR early so that 
      the disease can be treated before substantial, irreversible vision loss occurs. 
      The level of DR severity indicates the extent of treatment necessary - vision 
      loss may be preventable by effective diabetes management in mild (early) stages, 
      rather than subjecting the patient to invasive laser surgery. Using artificial 
      intelligence (AI), highly accurate and efficient systems can be developed to help 
      assist medical professionals in screening and diagnosing DR earlier and without 
      the full resources that are available in specialty clinics. In particular, deep 
      learning facilitates diagnosis earlier and with higher sensitivity and 
      specificity. Such systems make decisions based on minimally handcrafted features 
      and pave the way for personalized therapies. Thus, this survey provides a 
      comprehensive description of the current technology used in each step of DR 
      diagnosis. First, it begins with an introduction to the disease and the current 
      technologies and resources available in this space. It proceeds to discuss the 
      frameworks that different teams have used to detect and classify DR. Ultimately, 
      we conclude that deep learning systems offer revolutionary potential to DR 
      identification and prevention of vision loss.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper systematically reviews the recent progress in 
      diabetic retinopathy screening. It provides an integrated overview of the current 
      state of knowledge of emerging techniques using artificial intelligence 
      integration in national screening programs around the world. Existing 
      methodological approaches and research insights are evaluated. An understanding 
      of existing gaps and future directions is created. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past 
      decades, artificial intelligence has emerged into the scientific consciousness 
      with breakthroughs that are sparking increasing interest among computer science 
      and medical communities. Specifically, machine learning and deep learning (a 
      subtype of machine learning) applications of artificial intelligence are 
      spreading into areas that previously were thought to be only the purview of 
      humans, and a number of applications in ophthalmology field have been explored. 
      Multiple studies all around the world have demonstrated that such systems can 
      behave on par with clinical experts with robust diagnostic performance in 
      diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. However, only few tools have been evaluated in 
      clinical prospective studies. Given the rapid and impressive progress of 
      artificial intelligence technologies, the implementation of deep learning systems 
      into routinely practiced diabetic retinopathy screening could represent a 
      cost-effective alternative to help reduce the incidence of preventable blindness 
      around the world.

TI  - A novel four-step feature selection technique for diabetic retinopathy grading.
PG  - 1351-1366
LID - 10.1007/s13246-021-01073-4 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus that 
      develops over time. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the retinal disorders. Early 
      detection of diabetic retinopathy reduces the chances of permanent vision loss. 
      However, the identification and regular diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is a 
      time-consuming task and requires expert ophthalmologists and radiologists. In 
      addition, an automatic diabetic retinopathy detection technique is necessary for 
      real-time applications to facilitate and minimize potential human errors. 
      Therefore, we propose an ensemble deep neural network and a novel four-step 
      feature selection technique in this paper. In the first step, the preprocessed 
      entropy images improve the quality of the retinal features. Second, the 
      features are extracted using a deep ensemble model include InceptionV3, 
      ResNet101, and Vgg19 from the retinal fundus images. Then, these features are 
      combined to create an ample feature space. To reduce the feature space, we 
      propose four-step feature selection techniques: minimum redundancy, maximum 
      relevance, Chi-Square, ReliefF, and F test for selecting efficient features. 
      Further, appropriate features are chosen from the majority voting techniques to 
      reduce the computational complexity. Finally, the standard machine learning 
      classifier, support vector machines, is used in diabetic retinopathy 
      classification. The proposed method is tested on Kaggle, MESSIDOR-2, and IDRiD 
      databases, available publicly. The proposed algorithm provided an accuracy of 
      97.78%, a sensitivity of 97.6%, and a specificity of 99.3%, using top 300 
      features, which are better than other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Early Diagnosis of Retinal Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/medicina60040527 [doi]
LID - 527
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in the field of 
      ophthalmology, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and management. This paper 
      provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in various retinal diseases, 
      highlighting its potential to enhance screening efficiency, facilitate early 
      diagnosis, and improve patient outcomes. Herein, we elucidate the fundamental 
      concepts of AI, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and their 
      application in ophthalmology, underscoring the significance of AI-driven 
      solutions in addressing the complexity and variability of retinal diseases. 
      Furthermore, we delve into the specific applications of AI in retinal diseases 
      such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
      Macular Neovascularization, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retinal vein 
      occlusion (RVO), hypertensive retinopathy (HR), Retinitis Pigmentosa, Stargardt 
      disease, best vitelliform macular dystrophy, and sickle cell retinopathy. We 
      focus on the current landscape of AI technologies, including various AI models, 
      their performance metrics, and clinical implications. Furthermore, we aim to 
      address challenges and pitfalls associated with the integration of AI in clinical 
      practice, including the "black box phenomenon", biases in data representation, 
      and limitations in comprehensive patient assessment. In conclusion, this review 
      emphasizes the collaborative role of AI alongside healthcare professionals, 
      advocating for a synergistic approach to healthcare delivery. It highlights the 
      importance of leveraging AI to augment, rather than replace, human expertise, 
      thereby maximizing its potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, mitigate 
      healthcare disparities, and improve patient outcomes in the evolving landscape of 
      medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if combining clinical, demographic, and imaging data 
      improves automated diagnosis of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional imaging and machine learning study. METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective study performed at a single academic medical center in the United 
      States. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years and a diagnosis of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM). Exclusion criteria were non-DR retinal disease and inability to 
      image the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) 
      were performed, and data on age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 
      hemoglobin A1c were collected. Machine learning techniques were then applied. 
      Multiple pathophysiologically important features were automatically extracted 
      from each layer on OCT and each OCTA plexus and combined with clinical data in a 
      random forest classifier to develop the system, whose results were compared to 
      the clinical grading of NPDR, the gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients 
      with DM II were included in the study, 36 with DM without DR, 53 with mild NPDR, 
      and 22 with moderate NPDR. When OCT images alone were analyzed by the system, 
      accuracy of diagnosis was 76%, sensitivity 85%, specificity 87%, and area under 
      the curve (AUC) was 0.78. When OCT and OCTA data together were analyzed, accuracy 
      was 92%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 98%, and AUC 0.92. When all data modalities 
      were combined, the system achieved an accuracy of 96%, sensitivity 100%, 
      specificity 94%, and AUC 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: Combining common clinical data points 
      with OCT and OCTA data enhances the power of computer-aided diagnosis of NPDR.

AB  - Most diabetes patients develop a condition known as diabetic retinopathy after 
      having diabetes for a prolonged period. Due to this ailment, damaged blood 
      vessels may occur behind the retina, which can even progress to a stage of losing 
      vision. Hence, doctors advise diabetes patients to screen their retinas 
      regularly. Examining the fundus for this requires a long time and there are few 
      ophthalmologists available to check the ever-increasing number of diabetes 
      patients. To address this issue, several computer-aided automated systems are 
      being developed with the help of many techniques like deep learning. Extracting 
      the retinal vasculature is a significant step that aids in developing such 
      systems. This paper presents a GAN-based model to perform retinal vasculature 
      segmentation. The model achieves good results on the ARIA, DRIVE, and HRF 
      datasets.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness for people 
      who have diabetes in the world. However, early detection of this disease can 
      essentially decrease its effects on the patient. The recent breakthroughs in 
      technologies, including the use of smart health systems based on Artificial 
      intelligence, IoT and Blockchain are trying to improve the early diagnosis and 
      treatment of diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we presented an AI-based smart 
      teleopthalmology application for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The app has 
      the ability to facilitate the analyses of eye fundus images via deep learning 
      from the Kaggle database using Tensor Flow mathematical library. The app would be 
      useful in promoting mHealth and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy by 
      clinicians. With the AI-based application presented in this paper, patients can 
      easily get supports and physicians and researchers can also mine or predict data 
      on diabetic retinopathy and reports generated could assist doctors to determine 
      the level of severity of the disease among the people.

AB  - AIMS: Periodical screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) by an ophthalmologist is 
      expensive and demanding. Automated DR image evaluation with Artificial 
      Intelligence tools may represent a clinical and cost-effective alternative for 
      the detection of retinopathy. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reliability 
      of a machine learning algorithm. METHODS: This was an observational diagnostic 
      precision study that compared human grader classification with that of DAIRET(®), 
      an algorithm nested in an electronic medical record powered by Retmarker SA. 
      Retinal images were taken from 637 consecutive patients attending a routine 
      annual diabetic visit between June 2021 and February 2023. They were manually 
      graded by an ophthalmologist following the International Clinical Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Severity Scale and the results were compared with those of the AI 
      responses. The main outcome measures were screening performance, such as 
      sensitivity and specificity and diagnostic accuracy by 95% confidence intervals. 
      RESULTS: The rate of cases classified as ungradable was 1.2%, a figure consistent 
      with the literature. DAIRET(®) sensitivity in the detection of cases of referable 
      DR (moderate and above, "sight-threatening" forms of retinopathy) was equal to 1 
      (100%). The specificity, that is the true negative rate of absence of DR, was 
      80 ± 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: DAIRET(®) achieved excellent sensitivity for referable 
      retinopathy compared with that of human graders. This is undoubtedly the key 
      finding of the study and translates into the certainty that no patient in need of 
      the ophthalmologist is misdiagnosed as negative. It also had sufficient 
      specificity to represent a cost-effective alternative to manual grade alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy-related (DR-related) diseases are posing an 
      increasing threat to eye health as the number of patients with diabetes mellitus 
      that are young increases significantly. The automatic diagnosis of DR-related 
      diseases has benefited from the rapid development of image semantic segmentation 
      and other deep learning technology. METHODS: Inspired by the architecture of 
      U-Net family, a neighbored attention U-Net (NAU-Net) is designed to balance the 
      identification performance and computational cost for DR fundus image 
      segmentation. In the new network, only the neighboring high- and low-dimensional 
      feature maps of the encoder and decoder are fused by using four attention gates. 
      With the help of this improvement, the common target features in the 
      high-dimensional feature maps of encoder are enhanced, and they are also fused 
      with the low-dimensional feature map of decoder. Moreover, this network fuses 
      only neighboring layers and does not include the inner layers commonly used in 
      U-Net++. Consequently, the proposed network incurs a better identification 
      performance with a lower computational cost. RESULTS: The experimental results of 
      three open datasets of DR fundus images, including DRIVE, HRF, and CHASEDB, 
      indicate that the NAU-Net outperforms FCN, SegNet, attention U-Net, and U-Net++ 
      in terms of Dice score, IoU, accuracy, and precision, while its computation cost 
      is between attention U-Net and U-Net++. CONCLUSION: The proposed NAU-Net exhibits 
      better performance at a relatively low computational cost and provides an 
      efficient novel approach for DR fundus image segmentation and a new automatic 
      tool for DR-related eye disease diagnosis.

AB  - This review addresses the complexities of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its 
      associated complications, with a particular focus on diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      This review outlines the progression from non-proliferative to proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, highlighting the role of 
      dysglycemia in the pathogenesis of these conditions. A significant portion of 
      this review is devoted to technological advances in diabetes management, 
      particularly the use of hybrid closed-loop systems (HCLSs) and to the potential 
      of open-source HCLSs, which could be easily adapted to different patients' needs 
      using big data analytics and machine learning. Personalized HCLS algorithms that 
      integrate factors such as patient lifestyle, dietary habits, and hormonal 
      variations are highlighted as critical to reducing the incidence of 
      diabetes-related complications and improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Weakly supervised training for eye fundus lesion segmentation in patients with 
      diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in 
      working-age adults. Early screening and diagnosis can help to facilitate 
      subsequent treatment and prevent vision loss. Deep learning has been applied in 
      various fields of medical identification. However, current deep learning-based 
      lesion segmentation techniques rely on a large amount of pixel-level labeled 
      ground truth data, which limits their performance and application. In this work, 
      we present a weakly supervised deep learning framework for eye fundus lesion 
      segmentation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: First, an efficient 
      segmentation algorithm based on grayscale and morphological features is proposed 
      for rapid coarse segmentation of lesions. Then, a deep learning model named 
      Residual-Attention Unet (RAUNet) is proposed for eye fundus lesion segmentation. 
      Finally, a data sample of fundus images with labeled lesions and unlabeled images 
      with coarse segmentation results is jointly used to train RAUNet to broaden the 
      diversity of lesion samples and increase the robustness of the segmentation 
      model. RESULTS: A dataset containing 582 fundus images with labels verified by 
      doctors, including hemorrhage (HE), microaneurysm (MA), hard exudate (EX) and 
      soft exudate (SE), and 903 images without labels was used to evaluate the model. 
      In ablation test, the proposed RAUNet achieved the highest intersection over 
      union (IOU) on the labeled dataset, and the proposed attention and residual 
      modules both improved the IOU of the UNet benchmark. Using both the images 
      labeled by doctors and the proposed coarse segmentation method, the weakly 
      supervised framework based on RAUNet architecture significantly improved the mean 
      segmentation accuracy by over 7% on the lesions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study 
      demonstrates that combining unlabeled medical images with coarse segmentation 
      results can effectively improve the robustness of the lesion segmentation model 
      and proposes a practical framework for improving the performance of medical image 
      segmentation given limited labeled data samples.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy occurs due to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, and 
      it is a major health problem in recent years that progresses slowly without 
      recognizable symptoms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a popular and widely 
      used noninvasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. 
      Accurate and early diagnosis of this disease using OCT images is crucial for the 
      prevention of blindness. In recent years, several deep learning methods have been 
      very successful in automating the process of detecting retinal diseases from OCT 
      images. However, most methods face reliability and interpretability issues. In 
      this study, we propose a deep residual network for the classification of four 
      classes of retinal diseases, namely diabetic macular edema (DME), choroidal 
      neovascularization (CNV), DRUSEN and NORMAL in OCT images. The proposed model is 
      based on the popular architecture called ResNet50, which eliminates the vanishing 
      gradient problem and is pre-trained on large dataset such as ImageNet and trained 
      end-to-end on the publicly available OCT image dataset. We removed the fully 
      connected layer of ResNet50 and placed our new fully connected block on top to 
      improve the classification accuracy and avoid overfitting in the proposed model. 
      The proposed model was trained and evaluated using different performance metrics, 
      including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve on a dataset of 84,452 
      OCT images with expert disease grading as DRUSEN, CNV, DME and NORMAL. The 
      proposed model provides an improved overall classification accuracy of 99.48% 
      with only 5 misclassifications out of 968 test samples and outperforms existing 
      methods on the same dataset. The results show that the proposed model is well 
      suited for the diagnosis of retinal diseases in ophthalmology clinics.

TI  - The Need for Artificial Intelligence Based Risk Factor Analysis for Age-Related 
      Macular Degeneration: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13010130 [doi]
LID - 130
AB  - In epidemiology, a risk factor is a variable associated with increased disease 
      risk. Understanding the role of risk factors is significant for developing a 
      strategy to improve global health. There is strong evidence that risk factors 
      like smoking, alcohol consumption, previous cataract surgery, age, high-density 
      lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, BMI, female gender, and focal hyper-pigmentation 
      are independently associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
      Currently, in the literature, statistical techniques like logistic regression, 
      multivariable logistic regression, etc., are being used to identify AMD risk 
      factors by employing numerical/categorical data. However, artificial intelligence 
      (AI) techniques have not been used so far in the literature for identifying risk 
      factors for AMD. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) based tools can 
      anticipate when a person is at risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer, 
      dementia, asthma, etc., in providing personalized care. AI-based techniques can 
      employ numerical/categorical and/or image data thus resulting in multimodal data 
      analysis, which provides the need for AI-based tools to be used for risk factor 
      analysis in ophthalmology. This review summarizes the statistical techniques used 
      to identify various risk factors and the higher benefits that AI techniques 
      provide for AMD-related disease prediction. Additional studies are required to 
      review different techniques for risk factor identification for other ophthalmic 
      diseases like glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, retinopathy of prematurity, 
      cataract, and diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - ELEMENT: Multi-Modal Retinal Vessel Segmentation Based on a Coupled Region 
      Growing and Machine Learning Approach.
PG  - 3507-3519

AB  - Vascular structures in the retina contain important information for the detection 
      and analysis of ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, 
      diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Commonly used modalities in diagnosis of these 
      diseases are fundus photography, scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) and 
      fluorescein angiography (FA). Typically, retinal vessel segmentation is carried 
      out either manually or interactively, which makes it time consuming and prone to 
      human errors. In this research, we propose a new multi-modal framework for vessel 
      segmentation called ELEMENT (vEsseL sEgmentation using Machine lEarning and 
      coNnecTivity). This framework consists of feature extraction and pixel-based 
      classification using region growing and machine learning. The proposed features 
      capture complementary evidence based on grey level and vessel connectivity 
      properties. The latter information is seamlessly propagated through the pixels at 
      the classification phase. ELEMENT reduces inconsistencies and speeds up the 
      segmentation throughput. We analyze and compare the performance of the proposed 
      approach against state-of-the-art vessel segmentation algorithms in three major 
      groups of experiments, for each of the ocular modalities. Our method produced 
      higher overall performance, with an overall accuracy of 97.40%, compared to 25 of 
      the 26 state-of-the-art approaches, including six works based on deep learning, 
      evaluated on the widely known DRIVE fundus image dataset. In the case of the 
      STARE, CHASE-DB, VAMPIRE FA, IOSTAR SLO and RC-SLO datasets, the proposed 
      framework outperformed all of the state-of-the-art methods with accuracies of 
      98.27%, 97.78%, 98.34%, 98.04% and 98.35%, respectively.

TI  - Deep Learning Approaches to Surrogates for Solving the Diffusion Equation for 
      Mechanistic Real-World Simulations.
PG  - 667828

LID - 667828
AB  - In many mechanistic medical, biological, physical, and engineered spatiotemporal 
      dynamic models the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), 
      especially for diffusion, fluid flow and mechanical relaxation, can make 
      simulations impractically slow. Biological models of tissues and organs often 
      require the simultaneous calculation of the spatial variation of concentration of 
      dozens of diffusing chemical species. One clinical example where rapid 
      calculation of a diffusing field is of use is the estimation of oxygen gradients 
      in the retina, based on imaging of the retinal vasculature, to guide surgical 
      interventions in diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the ability to predict blood 
      perfusion and oxygenation may one day guide clinical interventions in diverse 
      settings, i.e., from stent placement in treating heart disease to BOLD fMRI 
      interpretation in evaluating cognitive function (Xie et al., 2019; Lee et al., 
      2020). Since the quasi-steady-state solutions required for fast-diffusing 
      chemical species like oxygen are particularly computationally costly, we consider 
      the use of a neural network to provide an approximate solution to the 
      steady-state diffusion equation. Machine learning surrogates, neural networks 
      trained to provide approximate solutions to such complicated numerical problems, 
      can often provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude compared to direct 
      calculation. Surrogates of PDEs could enable use of larger and more detailed 
      models than are possible with direct calculation and can make including such 
      simulations in real-time or near-real time workflows practical. Creating a 
      surrogate requires running the direct calculation tens of thousands of times to 
      generate training data and then training the neural network, both of which are 
      computationally expensive. Often the practical applications of such models 
      require thousands to millions of replica simulations, for example for parameter 
      identification and uncertainty quantification, each of which gains speed from 
      surrogate use and rapidly recovers the up-front costs of surrogate generation. We 
      use a Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the stationary solution to the 
      diffusion equation in the case of two equal-diameter, circular, constant-value 
      sources located at random positions in a two-dimensional square domain with 
      absorbing boundary conditions. Such a configuration caricatures the chemical 
      concentration field of a fast-diffusing species like oxygen in a tissue with two 
      parallel blood vessels in a cross section perpendicular to the two blood vessels. 
      To improve convergence during training, we apply a training approach that uses 
      roll-back to reject stochastic changes to the network that increase the loss 
      function. The trained neural network approximation is about 1000 times faster 
      than the direct calculation for individual replicas. Because different 
      applications will have different criteria for acceptable approximation accuracy, 
      we discuss a variety of loss functions and accuracy estimators that can help 
      select the best network for a particular application. We briefly discuss some of 
      the issues we encountered with overfitting, mismapping of the field values and 
      the geometrical conditions that lead to large absolute and relative errors in the 
      approximate solution.

AB  - PURPOSE: We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), named Retinal 
      Fluid Segmentation Network (ReF-Net), to segment retinal fluid in diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes. METHODS: The 
      3- × 3-mm OCT scans were acquired on one eye by a 70-kHz OCT commercial AngioVue 
      system (RTVue-XR; Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) from 51 participants in a 
      clinical diabetic retinopathy (DR) study (45 with retinal edema and six healthy 
      controls, age 61.3 ± 10.1 (mean ± SD), 33% female, and all DR cases were 
      diagnosed as severe NPDR or PDR). A CNN with U-Net-like architecture was 
      constructed to detect and segment the retinal fluid. Cross-sectional OCT and 
      angiography (OCTA) scans were used for training and testing ReF-Net. The effect 
      of including OCTA data for retinal fluid segmentation was investigated in this 
      study. Volumetric retinal fluid can be constructed using the output of ReF-Net. 
      Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve, intersection-over-union 
      (IoU), and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the performance of ReF-Net. 
      RESULTS: ReF-Net shows high accuracy (F1 = 0.864 ± 0.084) in retinal fluid 
      segmentation. The performance can be further improved (F1 = 0.892 ± 0.038) by 
      including information from both OCTA and structural OCT. ReF-Net also shows 
      strong robustness to shadow artifacts. Volumetric retinal fluid can provide more 
      comprehensive information than the two-dimensional (2D) area, whether 
      cross-sectional or en face projections. CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning-based method 
      can accurately segment retinal fluid volumetrically on OCT/OCTA scans with strong 
      robustness to shadow artifacts. OCTA data can improve retinal fluid segmentation. 
      Volumetric representations of retinal fluid are superior to 2D projections. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Using a deep learning method to segment retinal fluid 
      volumetrically has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of diabetic 
      macular edema by OCT systems.

AB  - Presence of exudates on a retina is an early sign of diabetic retinopathy, and 
      automatic detection of these can improve the diagnosis of the disease. 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used for automatic exudate 
      detection, but with poor performance. This study has investigated different deep 
      learning techniques to maximize the sensitivity and specificity. We have compared 
      multiple deep learning methods, and both supervised and unsupervised classifiers 
      for improving the performance of automatic exudate detection, i.e., CNNs, 
      pre-trained Residual Networks (ResNet-50) and Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann 
      Machines. The experiments were conducted on two publicly available databases: (i) 
      DIARETDB1 and (ii) e-Ophtha. The results show that ResNet-50 with Support Vector 
      Machines outperformed other networks with an accuracy and sensitivity of 98% and 
      0.99, respectively. This shows that ResNet-50 can be used for the analysis of the 
      fundus images to detect exudates.

TI  - MediNet: transfer learning approach with MediNet medical visual database.
PG  - 1-44
LID - 10.1007/s11042-023-14831-1 [doi]
AB  - The rapid development of machine learning has increased interest in the use of 
      deep learning methods in medical research. Deep learning in the medical field is 
      used in disease detection and classification problems in the clinical 
      decision-making process. Large amounts of labeled datasets are often required to 
      train deep neural networks; however, in the medical field, the lack of a 
      sufficient number of images in datasets and the difficulties encountered during 
      data collection are among the main problems. In this study, we propose MediNet, a 
      new 10-class visual dataset consisting of Rontgen (X-ray), Computed Tomography 
      (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Histopathological images 
      such as calcaneal normal, calcaneal tumor, colon benign colon adenocarcinoma, 
      brain normal, brain tumor, breast benign, breast malignant, chest normal, chest 
      pneumonia. AlexNet, VGG19-BN, Inception V3, DenseNet 121, ResNet 101, 
      EfficientNet B0, Nested-LSTM + CNN, and proposed RdiNet deep learning algorithms 
      are used in the transfer learning for pre-training and classification 
      application. Transfer learning aims to apply previously learned knowledge in a 
      new task. Seven algorithms were trained with the MediNet dataset, and the models 
      obtained from these algorithms, namely feature vectors, were recorded. 
      Pre-training models were used for classification studies on chest X-ray images, 
      diabetic retinopathy, and Covid-19 datasets with the transfer learning technique. 
      In performance measurement, an accuracy of 94.84% was obtained in the traditional 
      classification study for the InceptionV3 model in the classification study 
      performed on the Chest X-Ray Images dataset, and the accuracy was increased 
      98.71% after the transfer learning technique was applied. In the Covid-19 
      dataset, the classification success of the DenseNet121 model before pre-trained 
      was 88%, while the performance after the transfer application with MediNet was 
      92%. In the Diabetic retinopathy dataset, the classification success of the 
      Nested-LSTM + CNN model before pre-trained was 79.35%, while the classification 
      success was 81.52% after the transfer application with MediNet. The comparison of 
      results obtained from experimental studies observed that the proposed method 
      produced more successful results.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field which could make an intelligent 
      healthcare model a reality and has been garnering traction in the field of 
      medicine, with promising results. There have been recent developments in machine 
      learning and/or deep learning algorithms for applications in 
      ophthalmology-primarily for diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular 
      degeneration. However, AI research in the field of cornea diseases is relatively 
      new. Algorithms have been described to assist clinicians in diagnosis or 
      detection of cornea conditions such as keratoconus, infectious keratitis and dry 
      eye disease. AI may also be used for segmentation and analysis of cornea imaging 
      or tomography as an adjunctive tool. Despite the potential advantages that these 
      new technologies offer, there are challenges that need to be addressed before 
      they can be integrated into clinical practice. In this review, we aim to 
      summarize current literature and provide an update regarding recent advances in 
      AI technologies pertaining to corneal diseases, and its potential future 
      application, in particular pertaining to image analysis.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Diabetic Eye Disease Screening.
PG  - 158-164
LID - 10.22608/APO.201976 [doi]
AB  - Systematic or national screening programs for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and 
      diabetic macular edema (DME), using digital fundus photography and optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT), are currently implemented at primary care level, 
      aiming to provide timely referral for vision-threatening DR and DME to 
      ophthalmologists for timely treatment and vision loss prevention. However, 
      interpretation of retinal images requires specialized knowledge and expertise in 
      diabetic eye disease. Furthermore, current DR screening programs are capital- and 
      labor-intensive, which makes it difficult to rapidly scale up and expand diabetic 
      eye screening to meet the needs of this growing global epidemic. Deep learning 
      (DL), a new branch of machine learning technology under the broad term of 
      artificial intelligence (AI), has made remarkable breakthrough in medical imaging 
      in particular for pattern recognition and image classification. In ophthalmology, 
      AI and DL technology has been developed from big image datasets in assessment of 
      retinal photographs for detection and screening of DR as well as the segmentation 
      and assessment of OCT images for diagnosis and screening of DME. This review 
      aimed to summarize the current progress and the development of using AI and DL 
      technology for diabetic eye disease screening as well as current challenges in 
      the actual implementation of DL in screening programs, and translating DL 
      research into direct clinical applications of screening in a community setting.

AB  - Significant progress has been made in artificial intelligence and computer vision 
      research in recent years. Machine learning methods excel in a wide variety of 
      tasks where sufficient data are available. We describe the application of a deep 
      convolutional neural network for the prediction of treatment indication with 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications based on central 
      retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. The neural network classifier 
      was trained with OCT images acquired during routine treatment at the University 
      of Regensburg over the years 2008-2016. In over 95% of the cases the treatment 
      indication was accurately predicted based on a singular OCT B scan without human 
      intervention. Despite promising classification the results of deep learning 
      techniques, should always be controlled by the treating physician because false 
      classification can never be excluded due to the probabilistic nature of the 
      method.

TI  - Prediction of response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment in 
      diabetic macular oedema using an optical coherence tomography-based machine 
      learning method.
PG  - e19-e27
LID - 10.1111/aos.14514 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To predict the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      therapeutic response of diabetic macular oedema (DME) patients from optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) at the initiation stage of treatment using a machine 
      learning-based self-explainable system. METHODS: A total of 712 DME patients were 
      included and classified into poor and good responder groups according to central 
      macular thickness decrease after three consecutive injections. Machine learning 
      models were constructed to make predictions based on related features extracted 
      automatically using deep learning algorithms from OCT scans at baseline. 
      Five-fold cross-validation was applied to optimize and evaluate the models. The 
      model with the best performance was then compared with two ophthalmologists. 
      Feature importance was further investigated, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was 
      performed to assess the difference of a single feature between two groups. 
      RESULTS: Of 712 patients, 294 were poor responders and 418 were good responders. 
      The best performance for the prediction task was achieved by random forest (RF), 
      with sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of 0.900, 0.851 and 0.923. Ophthalmologist 1 and 
      ophthalmologist 2 reached sensitivity of 0.775 and 0.750, and specificity of 
      0.716 and 0.821, respectively. The sum of hyperreflective dots was found to be 
      the most relevant feature for prediction. CONCLUSION: An RF classifier was 
      constructed to predict the treatment response of anti-VEGF from OCT images of DME 
      patients with high accuracy. The algorithm contributes to predicting treatment 
      requirements in advance and provides an optimal individualized therapeutic 
      regimen.

AB  - During an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening 
      event, we performed a survey on patients´ perceptions on AI. Respondents were 
      individuals with diabetes, mostly followed in primary healthcare with a low 
      education level. While 49.6% of participants said they knew what AI was, only 14% 
      reported good or expert knowledge of AI. The vast majority reported positive 
      feelings towards AI in healthcare. We highlight the importance of understanding 
      patients´ views regarding AI in health in a real-life situation and emphasize the 
      importance of digital education.

LID - 9139713
AB  - Deep learning of fundus photograph has emerged as a practical and cost-effective 
      technique for automatic screening and diagnosis of severer diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). The entropy image of luminance of fundus photograph has been demonstrated 
      to increase the detection performance for referable DR using a convolutional 
      neural network- (CNN-) based system. In this paper, the entropy image computed by 
      using the green component of fundus photograph is proposed. In addition, image 
      enhancement by unsharp masking (UM) is utilized for preprocessing before 
      calculating the entropy images. The bichannel CNN incorporating the features of 
      both the entropy images of the gray level and the green component preprocessed by 
      UM is also proposed to improve the detection performance of referable DR by deep 
      learning.

PG  - 97-112
LID - 10.1177/09691413221144382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the accuracy of artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-based systems for grading of fundus images in diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      screening. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the 
      ClinicalTrials.gov from 1st January 2000 to 27th August 2021. Accuracy studies 
      published in English were included if they met the pre-specified inclusion 
      criteria. Selection of studies for inclusion, data extraction and quality 
      assessment were conducted by one author with a second reviewer independently 
      screening and checking 20% of titles. Results were analysed narratively. RESULTS: 
      Forty-three studies evaluating 15 deep learning (DL) and 4 machine learning (ML) 
      systems were included. Nine systems were evaluated in a single study each. Most 
      studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one 
      QUADAS-2 domain. Sensitivity for referable DR and higher grades was ≥85% while 
      specificity varied and was <80% for all ML systems and in 6/31 studies evaluating 
      DL systems. Studies reported high accuracy for detection of ungradable images, 
      but the latter were analysed and reported inconsistently. Seven studies reported 
      that AI was more sensitive but less specific than human graders. CONCLUSIONS: 
      AI-based systems are more sensitive than human graders and could be safe to use 
      in clinical practice but have variable specificity. However, for many systems 
      evidence is limited, at high risk of bias and may not generalise across settings. 
      Therefore, pre-implementation assessment in the target clinical pathway is 
      essential to obtain reliable and applicable accuracy estimates.

TI  - Identifying Peripheral Neuropathy in Colour Fundus Photographs Based on Deep 
      Learning.

LID - 1943
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based system to 
      detect peripheral neuropathy (DN) from retinal colour images in people with 
      diabetes. Retinal images from 1561 people with diabetes were used to predictDN 
      diagnosed on vibration perception threshold. A total of 189 had diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR), 276 had DN, and 43 had both DR and DN. 90% of the images were 
      used for training and validation and 10% for testing. Deep neural networks, 
      including Squeezenet, Inception, and Densenet were utilized, and the 
      architectures were tested with and without pre-trained weights. Random transform 
      of images was used during training. The algorithm was trained and tested using 
      three sets of data: all retinal images, images without DR and images with DR. 
      Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate performance. The AUC to 
      predict DN on the whole cohort was 0.8013 (±0.0257) on the validation set and 
      0.7097 (±0.0031) on the test set. The AUC increased to 0.8673 (±0.0088) in the 
      presence of DR. The retinal images can be used to identify individuals with DN 
      and provides an opportunity to educate patients about their DN status when they 
      attend DR screening.

TI  - DeepUWF: An Automated Ultra-Wide-Field Fundus Screening System via Deep Learning.
PG  - 2988-2996
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3046771 [doi]
AB  - The emerging ultra-wide field of view (UWF) fundus color imaging is a powerful 
      tool for fundus screening. However, manual screening is labor-intensive and 
      subjective. Based on 2644 UWF images, a set of early fundus abnormal screening 
      system named DeepUWF is developed. DeepUWF includes an abnormal fundus screening 
      subsystem and a disease diagnosis subsystem for three kinds of fundus diseases 
      (retinal tear & retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and pathological 
      myopia). The components in the system are composed of a set of excellent 
      convolutional neural networks and two custom classifiers. However, the contrast 
      of UWF images used in the research is low, which seriously limits the extraction 
      of fine features of UWF images by depth model. Therefore, the high specificity 
      and low sensitivity of prediction results have always been difficult problems in 
      research. In order to solve this problem, six kinds of image preprocessing 
      techniques are adopted, and their effects on the prediction performance of fundus 
      abnormal and three kinds of fundus diseases models are studied. A variety of 
      experimental indicators are used to evaluate the algorithms for validity and 
      reliability. The experimental results show that these preprocessing methods are 
      helpful to improve the learning ability of the networks and achieve good 
      sensitivity and specificity. Without ophthalmologists, DeepUWF has potential 
      application value, which is helpful for fundus health screening and workflow 
      improvement.

TI  - Non-uniform Label Smoothing for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading from Retinal Fundus 
      Images with Deep Neural Networks.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1167/tvst.9.2.34 [doi]
LID - 34
AB  - PURPOSE: Introducing a new technique to improve deep learning (DL) models 
      designed for automatic grading of diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus 
      images by enhancing predictions' consistency. METHODS: A convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) was optimized in three different manners to predict DR grade from 
      eye fundus images. The optimization criteria were (1) the standard cross-entropy 
      (CE) loss; (2) CE supplemented with label smoothing (LS), a regularization 
      approach widely employed in computer vision tasks; and (3) our proposed 
      non-uniform label smoothing (N-ULS), a modification of LS that models the 
      underlying structure of expert annotations. RESULTS: Performance was measured in 
      terms of quadratic-weighted κ score (quad-κ) and average area under the receiver 
      operating curve (AUROC), as well as with suitable metrics for analyzing 
      diagnostic consistency, like weighted precision, recall, and F1 score, or 
      Matthews correlation coefficient. While LS generally harmed the performance of 
      the CNN, N-ULS statistically significantly improved performance with respect to 
      CE in terms quad-κ score (73.17 vs. 77.69, P < 0.025), without any performance 
      decrease in average AUROC. N-ULS achieved this while simultaneously increasing 
      performance for all other analyzed metrics. CONCLUSIONS: For extending standard 
      modeling approaches from DR detection to the more complex task of DR grading, it 
      is essential to consider the underlying structure of expert annotations. The 
      approach introduced in this article can be easily implemented in conjunction with 
      deep neural networks to increase their consistency without sacrificing per-class 
      performance. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: A straightforward modification of current 
      standard training practices of CNNs can substantially improve consistency in DR 
      grading, better modeling expert annotations and human variability.

TI  - Automatic recognition of severity level for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy 
      using deep visual features.
PG  - 1959-1974
LID - 10.1007/s11517-017-1638-6 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is leading cause of blindness among diabetic patients. 
      Recognition of severity level is required by ophthalmologists to early detect and 
      diagnose the DR. However, it is a challenging task for both medical experts and 
      computer-aided diagnosis systems due to requiring extensive domain expert 
      knowledge. In this article, a novel automatic recognition system for the five 
      severity level of diabetic retinopathy (SLDR) is developed without performing any 
      pre- and post-processing steps on retinal fundus images through learning of deep 
      visual features (DVFs). These DVF features are extracted from each image by using 
      color dense in scale-invariant and gradient location-orientation histogram 
      techniques. To learn these DVF features, a semi-supervised multilayer 
      deep-learning algorithm is utilized along with a new compressed layer and 
      fine-tuning steps. This SLDR system was evaluated and compared with 
      state-of-the-art techniques using the measures of sensitivity (SE), specificity 
      (SP) and area under the receiving operating curves (AUC). On 750 fundus images 
      (150 per category), the SE of 92.18%, SP of 94.50% and AUC of 0.924 values were 
      obtained on average. These results demonstrate that the SLDR system is 
      appropriate for early detection of DR and provide an effective treatment for 
      prediction type of diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with long standing diabetes duration can experience 
      damage to small microvascular blood vessels leading to diabetes complications 
      (DCs) and increased mortality. Precision diagnostic tailors a diagnosis to an 
      individual by using biomedical information. Blood small molecule profiling 
      coupled with machine learning (ML) can facilitate the goals of precision 
      diagnostics, including earlier diagnosis and individualized risk scoring. 
      METHODS: Using data in a cohort of 537 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) we 
      predicted five-year progression to DCs. Prediction models were computed first 
      with clinical risk factors at baseline and then with clinical risk factors and 
      blood-derived molecular data at baseline. Progression of diabetic kidney disease 
      and diabetic retinopathy were predicted in two complication-specific models. 
      FINDINGS: The model predicts the progression to diabetic kidney disease with 
      accuracy: 0.96 ± 0.25 and 0.96 ± 0.06 area under curve, AUC, with clinical 
      measurements and with small molecule predictors respectively and highlighted main 
      predictors to be albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, retinopathy status at 
      baseline, sugar derivatives and ketones. For diabetic retinopathy, AUC 
      0.75 ± 0.14 and 0.79 ± 0.16 with clinical measurements and with small molecule 
      predictors respectively and highlighted key predictors, albuminuria, glomerular 
      filtration rate and retinopathy status at baseline. Individual risk scores were 
      built to visualize results. INTERPRETATION: With further validation ML tools 
      could facilitate the implementation of precision diagnosis in the clinic. It is 
      envisaged that patients could be screened for complications, before these occur, 
      thus preserving healthy life-years for persons with diabetes. FUNDING: This study 
      has been financially supported by Novo Nordisk Foundation grant NNF14OC0013659.

AB  - Deep learning-based systems can achieve a diagnostic performance comparable to 
      physicians in a variety of medical use cases including the diagnosis of diabetic 
      retinopathy. To be useful in clinical practice, it is necessary to have well 
      calibrated measures of the uncertainty with which these systems report their 
      decisions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being often overconfident in 
      their predictions, and are not amenable to a straightforward probabilistic 
      treatment. Here, we describe an intuitive framework based on test-time data 
      augmentation for quantifying the diagnostic uncertainty of a state-of-the-art DNN 
      for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. We show that the derived measure of 
      uncertainty is well-calibrated and that experienced physicians likewise find 
      cases with uncertain diagnosis difficult to evaluate. This paves the way for an 
      integrated treatment of uncertainty in DNN-based diagnostic systems.

TI  - An Intelligent Segmentation and Diagnosis Method for Diabetic Retinopathy Based 
      on Improved U-NET Network.

AB  - Due to insufficient samples, the generalization performance of deep network is 
      insufficient. In order to solve this problem, an improved U-net based image 
      automatic segmentation and diagnosis algorithm was proposed, in which the 
      max-pooling operation in original U-net model was replaced by the convolution 
      operation to keep more feature information. Firstly, the regions of 128×128 were 
      extracted from all slices of the patients as data samples. Secondly, the patient 
      samples were divided into training sample set and testing sample set, and data 
      augmentation was performed on the training samples. Finally, all the training 
      samples were adopted to train the model. Compared with Fully Convolutional 
      Network (FCN) model and max-pooling based U-net model, DSC and CR coefficients of 
      the proposed method achieve the best results, while PM coefficient is 2.55 
      percentage lower than the maximum value in the two comparison models, and Average 
      Symmetric Surface Distance is slightly higher than the minimum value of the two 
      comparison models by 0.004. The experimental results show that the proposed model 
      can achieve good segmentation and diagnosis results.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been studied in ophthalmology since availability 
      of digital information in ophthalmic care. The significant turning point was 
      availability of commercial digital color fundus photography in the late 1990s, 
      which caused digital screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) to take off. 
      Automated Retinal Disease Assessment software was then developed using machine 
      learning to detect abnormal lesions in fundus to screen DR. The use of this 
      version of AI had not been generalized because the specificity at 45% was not 
      high enough, although the sensitivity reached 90%. The recent breakthrough in 
      machine learning is the invent of deep learning, which accelerates its 
      performance to be on par with experts. The first 2 breakthrough studies on deep 
      learning for screening DR were conducted in Asia. The first represented 
      collaboration of datasets between Asia and the United States for algorithms 
      development, whereas the second represented algorithms developed in Asia but 
      validated in different populations across the world. Both found accuracy for 
      detecting referable DR of >95%. Diversity and variety are unique strengths of 
      Asia for AI studies. There are many more studies of AI ongoing in Asia not only 
      as prospective deployments in DR but in glaucoma, age-related macular 
      degeneration, cataract, and systemic disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Some 
      Asian countries have laid out plans for digital health care system using AI as 
      one of the puzzle pieces for solving blindness. More studies on AI and digital 
      health are expected to come from Asia in this new decade.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that can cause vision loss 
      among patients due to damage to blood vessels in the retina. Early retinal 
      screening can avoid the severe consequences of DR and enable timely treatment. 
      Nowadays, researchers are trying to develop automated deep learning-based DR 
      segmentation tools using retinal fundus images to help Ophthalmologists with DR 
      screening and early diagnosis. However, recent studies are unable to design 
      accurate models due to the unavailability of larger training data with consistent 
      and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we propose a 
      semi-supervised multitask learning approach that exploits widely available 
      unlabelled data (i.e., Kaggle-EyePACS) to improve DR segmentation performance. 
      The proposed model consists of novel multi-decoder architecture and involves both 
      unsupervised and supervised learning phases. The model is trained for the 
      unsupervised auxiliary task to effectively learn from additional unlabelled data 
      and improve the performance of the primary task of DR segmentation. The proposed 
      technique is rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets (i.e., FGADR 
      and IDRiD) and results show that the proposed technique not only outperforms 
      existing state-of-the-art techniques but also exhibits improved generalisation 
      and robustness for cross-data evaluation.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), as an important complication of diabetes, is the 
      primary cause of blindness in adults. Automatic DR detection poses a challenge 
      which is crucial for early DR screening. Currently, the vast majority of DR is 
      diagnosed through fundus images, where the microaneurysm (MA) has been widely 
      used as the most distinguishable marker. Research works on automatic DR detection 
      have traditionally utilized manually designed operators, while a few recent 
      researchers have explored deep learning techniques for this topic. But due to 
      issues such as the extremely small size of microaneurysms, low resolution of 
      fundus pictures, and insufficient imaging depth, the DR detection problem is 
      quite challenging and remains unsolved. To address these issues, this research 
      proposes a new deep learning model (Magnified Adaptive Feature Pyramid Network, 
      MAFP-Net) for DR detection, which conducts super-resolution on low quality fundus 
      images and integrates an improved feature pyramid structure while utilizing a 
      standard two-stage detection network as the backbone. Our proposed detection 
      model needs no pre-segmented patches to train the CNN network. When tested on the 
      E-ophtha-MA dataset, the sensitivity value of our method reached as high as 83.5% 
      at false positives per image (FPI) of 8 and the F1 value achieved 0.676, 
      exceeding all those of the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as the human 
      performance of experienced physicians. Similar results were achieved on another 
      public dataset of IDRiD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Deep learning is a newer and advanced subfield in artificial 
      intelligence (AI). The aim of our study is to validate a machine-based algorithm 
      developed based on deep convolutional neural networks as a tool for screening to 
      detect referable diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: An AI algorithm to detect DR 
      was validated at our hospital using an internal dataset consisting of 1,533 
      macula-centered fundus images collected retrospectively and an external 
      validation set using Methods to Evaluate Segmentation and Indexing Techniques in 
      the field of Retinal Ophthalmology (MESSIDOR) dataset. Images were graded by two 
      retina specialists as any DR, prompt referral (moderate nonproliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy (NPDR) or above or presence of macular edema) and sight-threatening 
      DR/STDR (severe NPDR or above) and compared with AI results. Sensitivity, 
      specificity, and area under curve (AUC) for both internal and external validation 
      sets for any DR detection, prompt referral, and STDR were calculated. 
      Interobserver agreement using kappa value was calculated for both the sets and 
      two out of three agreements for DR grading was considered as ground truth to 
      compare with AI results. RESULTS: In the internal validation set, the overall 
      sensitivity and specificity was 99.7% and 98.5% for Any DR detection and 98.9% 
      and 94.84%for Prompt referral respectively. The AUC was 0.991 and 0.969 for any 
      DR detection and prompt referral respectively. The agreement between two 
      observers was 99.5% and 99.2% for any DR detection and prompt referral with a 
      kappa value of 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. In the external validation set 
      (MESSIDOR 1), the overall sensitivity and specificity was 90.4% and 91.0% for any 
      DR detection and 94.7% and 97.4% for prompt referral, respectively. The AUC was. 
      907 and. 960 for any DR detection and prompt referral, respectively. The 
      agreement between two observers was 98.5% and 97.8% for any DR detection and 
      prompt referral with a kappa value of 0.971 and 0.980, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      With increasing diabetic population and growing demand supply gap in trained 
      resources, AI is the future for early identification of DR and reducing 
      blindness. This can revolutionize telescreening in ophthalmology, especially 
      where people do not have access to specialized health care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, through deep 
      learning algorithms, for the development and optimization of a system for 
      predicting the age of a person based on a color retinography and to study a 
      possible relationship between the evolution of retinopathy diabetes and premature 
      ageing of the retina. METHODS: A convolutional network was trained to calculate 
      the age of a person based on a retinography. Said training was carried out on a 
      set of retinographies of patients with diabetes previously divided into three 
      subsets (training, validation and test). The difference between the chronological 
      age of the patient and the biological age of the retina was defined as the 
      retinal age gap. RESULTS: A set of 98,400 images was used for the training phase, 
      1000 images for the validation phase and 13,544 for the test phase. The retinal 
      gap of the patients without DR was 0.609 years and that of the patients with DR 
      was 1905 years (p < 0.001), with the distribution by degree of DR being: mild DR: 
      1541 years, moderate DR: 3017 years, DR severe: 3117 years and proliferative DR: 
      8583 years. CONCLUSIONS: The retinal age gap shows a positive mean difference 
      between diabetics with DR versus those without DR, and it increases 
      progressively, according to the degree of DR. These results could indicate the 
      existence of a relationship between the evolution of the disease and premature 
      ageing of the retina.

AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME), being a frequent manifestation of DR, disrupts the 
      retinal symmetry. This event is particularly triggered by vascular endothelial 
      growth factors (VEGF). Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGFs have been the most 
      practiced treatment but an expensive option. A major challenge associated with 
      this treatment is determining an optimal treatment regimen and differentiating 
      patients who do not respond to anti-VEGF. As it has a significant burden for both 
      the patient and the health care providers if the patient is not responding, any 
      clinically acceptable method to predict the treatment outcomes holds huge value 
      in the efficient management of DME. In such situations, artificial intelligence 
      (AI) or machine learning (ML)-based algorithms come useful as they can analyze 
      past clinical details of the patients and help clinicians to predict the 
      patient's response to an anti-VEGF agent. The work presented here attempts to 
      review the literature that is available from the peer research community to 
      discuss solutions provided by AI/ML methodologies to tackle challenges in DME 
      management. Lastly, a possibility for using two different types of data has been 
      proposed, which is believed to be the key differentiators as compared to the 
      similar and recent contributions from the peer research community.

TI  - Subfoveal choroidal thickness changes after intravitreal ranibizumab injections 
      in different patterns of diabetic macular edema using a deep learning-based 
      auto-segmentation.
PG  - 4399-4407
LID - 10.1007/s10792-021-01806-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) on 
      subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and its relationship with central macular 
      thickness (CMT) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) changes in eyes with 
      center-involving DME (CI-DME) using a deep learning-based auto-segmentation. 
      METHODS: This prospective interventional case series included 68 eyes of 68 
      patients with CI-DME naive to treatment. Morphological optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) findings of DME were classified into three patterns of 
      structural change: (i) diffuse retinal thickening (DRT), (ii) cystoid macular 
      edema (CME), and (iii) serous retinal detachment (SRD). All patients underwent 
      3+prorenata IVR. The treated eyes underwent BCVA evaluation and OCT scanning at 
      baseline and months 1, 3, and 6 after the first injection. Then, the choroid 
      layer was measured using a deep learning-based auto-segmentation. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, the mean SFCT and CMT for SRD, DRT, and CME groups were 
      324.68 ± 65.58 μm and 624.37 ± 77.92 μm, 348.91 ± 45.81 μm and 443.5 ± 78.33 μm, 
      361.4 ± 64.62 μm, and 536.5 ± 66.02 μm, respectively. After anti-VEGF treatment, 
      the SFCT and CMT have decreased by varying degrees. At 3 and 6 months of 
      treatment, there were no significant changes among these groups. There was no 
      correlation between baseline SFCT and the resulting BCVA (P = 0.670, P = 0.584). 
      There was also no correlation between changes in SFCT and BCVA, CMT (P = 0.344, 
      P = 0.336). CONCLUSION: After treating CI-DME with IVR, SFCT and CMT 
      significantly decreased. However, there were no significant changes among the 
      SRD, DRT, and CME groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration: ChiCTR,

AB  - In recent years, eye diseases in diabetic patients are one of the most common has 
      been diabetic retinopathy (DR). which leads to complete blindness in advanced 
      stages. Diabetes affects the blood vessels in the retina and causes vision loss. 
      One of the ways to decrease the risk of this issue is to detect diabetic 
      retinopathy in its early stages. This study describes a computer-aided screening 
      system (DREAM) that uses a neural network classification model in machine 
      learning to assess fundus images with different illumination and fields of vision 
      and provide a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy. Moreover, the methodology 
      of this study based on:•Enhancement techniques have been used on dataset images, 
      histogram equalization, noise reduction and image scaling,•vSLAM has been 
      selected as feature extraction,•Bilayered Neural Network under resubstitution 
      validation used as a classification model. Finally, after testing on the DR 
      severity grading system is tested on 6332 images of detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy images, the result of the ROC curve is 0.985 on image dataset and 
      obtains accuracy reached 98.5%. The classification result has been founded under 
      MATLAB platform, beside it that be work with real time analysis and detection 
      when patient eyes analysis.

TI  - Testing Segmentation Popular Loss and Variations in Three Multiclass Medical 
      Imaging Problems.
LID - 10.3390/jimaging7020016 [doi]
LID - 16
AB  - Image structures are segmented automatically using deep learning (DL) for 
      analysis and processing. The three most popular base loss functions are cross 
      entropy (crossE), intersect-over-the-union (IoU), and dice. Which should be used, 
      is it useful to consider simple variations, such as modifying formula 
      coefficients? How do characteristics of different image structures influence 
      scores? Taking three different medical image segmentation problems (segmentation 
      of organs in magnetic resonance images (MRI), liver in computer tomography images 
      (CT) and diabetic retinopathy lesions in eye fundus images (EFI)), we quantify 
      loss functions and variations, as well as segmentation scores of different 
      targets. We first describe the limitations of metrics, since loss is a metric, 
      then we describe and test alternatives. Experimentally, we observed that 
      DeeplabV3 outperforms UNet and fully convolutional network (FCN) in all datasets. 
      Dice scored 1 to 6 percentage points (pp) higher than cross entropy over all 
      datasets, IoU improved 0 to 3 pp. Varying formula coefficients improved scores, 
      but the best choices depend on the dataset: compared to crossE, different false 
      positive vs. false negative weights improved MRI by 12 pp, and assigning zero 
      weight to background improved EFI by 6 pp. Multiclass segmentation scored higher 
      than n-uniclass segmentation in MRI by 8 pp. EFI lesions score low compared to 
      more constant structures (e.g., optic disk or even organs), but loss 
      modifications improve those scores significantly 6 to 9 pp. Our conclusions are 
      that dice is best, it is worth assigning 0 weight to class background and to test 
      different weights on false positives and false negatives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ophthalmological pathologies such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy 
      and age-related macular degeneration are major causes of blindness and vision 
      impairment. There is a need for novel decision support tools that can simplify 
      and speed up the diagnosis of these pathologies. A key step in this process is to 
      automatically estimate the quality of the fundus images to make sure these are 
      interpretable by a human operator or a machine learning model. We present a novel 
      fundus image quality scale and deep learning (DL) model that can estimate fundus 
      image quality relative to this new scale. METHODS: A total of 1245 images were 
      graded for quality by two ophthalmologists within the range 1-10, with a 
      resolution of 0.5. A DL regression model was trained for fundus image quality 
      assessment. The architecture used was Inception-V3. The model was developed using 
      a total of 89,947 images from 6 databases, of which 1245 were labeled by the 
      specialists and the remaining 88,702 images were used for pre-training and 
      semi-supervised learning. The final DL model was evaluated on an internal test 
      set (n=209) as well as an external test set (n=194). RESULTS: The final DL model, 
      denoted FundusQ-Net, achieved a mean absolute error of 0.61 (0.54-0.68) on the 
      internal test set. When evaluated as a binary classification model on the public 
      DRIMDB database as an external test set the model obtained an accuracy of 99%. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: the proposed algorithm provides a new robust tool for automated 
      quality grading of fundus images.

TI  - A new intelligent system based deep learning to detect DME and AMD in OCT images.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1007/s10792-024-03115-8 [doi]
AB  - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is widely recognized as the leading modality 
      for assessing ocular retinal diseases, playing a crucial role in diagnosing 
      retinopathy while maintaining a non-invasive modality. The increasing volume of 
      OCT images underscores the growing importance of automating image analysis. 
      Age-related diabetic Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) 
      are the most common cause of visual impairment. Early detection and timely 
      intervention for diabetes-related conditions are essential for preventing optical 
      complications and reducing the risk of blindness. This study introduces a novel 
      Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on a Convolutional Neural Network 
      (CNN) model, aiming to identify and classify OCT retinal images into AMD, DME, 
      and Normal classes. Leveraging CNN efficiency, including feature learning and 
      classification, various CNN, including pre-trained VGG16, VGG19, Inception_V3, a 
      custom from scratch model, BCNN (VGG16) 2 , BCNN (VGG19) 2 , and BCNN 
      (Inception_V3) 2 , are developed for the classification of AMD, DME, and Normal 
      OCT images. The proposed approach has been evaluated on two datasets, including a 
      DUKE public dataset and a Tunisian private dataset. The combination of the 
      Inception_V3 model and the extracted feature from the proposed custom CNN 
      achieved the highest accuracy value of 99.53% in the DUKE dataset. The obtained 
      results on DUKE public and Tunisian datasets demonstrate the proposed approach as 
      a significant tool for efficient and automatic retinal OCT image classification.

AB  - Deep learning is the state-of-the-art machine learning technique for ophthalmic 
      image analysis, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most commonly 
      utilized approach. Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a 
      promising approach, one that is even more powerful than CNNs. In this focused 
      review, we summarized studies that applied ViT-based models to analyze color 
      fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images. Overall, ViT-based 
      models showed robust performances in the grading of diabetic retinopathy and 
      glaucoma detection. While some studies demonstrated that ViTs were superior to 
      CNNs in certain contexts of use, it is unclear how widespread ViTs will be 
      adopted for ophthalmic image analysis, since ViTs typically require even more 
      training data as compared to CNNs. The studies included were identified from the 
      PubMed and Google Scholar databases using keywords relevant to this review. Only 
      original investigations through March 2023 were included.

AB  - Supervised deep learning has achieved prominent success in various diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) recognition tasks from optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      volumetric images. A common problematic issue that frequently occurs in this 
      field is the shortage of labeled data due to the expensive fine-grained 
      annotations, which increases substantial difficulty in accurate analysis by 
      supervised learning. The morphological changes in the retina caused by DME might 
      be distributed sparsely in B-scan images of the OCT volume, and OCT data is often 
      coarsely labeled at the volume level. Hence, the DME identification task can be 
      formulated as a multiple instance classification problem that could be addressed 
      by multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques. Nevertheless, none of previous 
      studies utilize unlabeled data simultaneously to promote the classification 
      accuracy, which is particularly significant for a high quality of analysis at the 
      minimum annotation cost. To this end, we present a novel deep semi-supervised 
      multiple instance learning framework to explore the feasibility of leveraging a 
      small amount of coarsely labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to 
      tackle this problem. Specifically, we come up with several modules to further 
      improve the performance according to the availability and granularity of their 
      labels. To warm up the training, we propagate the bag labels to the corresponding 
      instances as the supervision of training, and propose a self-correction strategy 
      to handle the label noise in the positive bags. This strategy is based on 
      confidence-based pseudo-labeling with consistency regularization. The model uses 
      its prediction to generate the pseudo-label for each weakly augmented input only 
      if it is highly confident about the prediction, which is subsequently used to 
      supervise the same input in a strongly augmented version. This learning scheme is 
      also applicable to unlabeled data. To enhance the discrimination capability of 
      the model, we introduce the Student-Teacher architecture and impose consistency 
      constraints between two models. For demonstration, the proposed approach was 
      evaluated on two large-scale DME OCT image datasets. Extensive results indicate 
      that the proposed method improves DME classification with the incorporation of 
      unlabeled data and outperforms competing MIL methods significantly, which confirm 
      the feasibility of deep semi-supervised multiple instance learning at a low 
      annotation cost.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sharing patient data across institutions to train generalizable deep 
      learning models is challenging due to regulatory and technical hurdles. 
      Distributed learning, where model weights are shared instead of patient data, 
      presents an attractive alternative. Cyclical weight transfer (CWT) has recently 
      been demonstrated as an effective distributed learning method for medical imaging 
      with homogeneous data across institutions. In this study, we optimize CWT to 
      overcome performance losses from variability in training sample sizes and label 
      distributions across institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimizations included 
      proportional local training iterations, cyclical learning rate, locally weighted 
      minibatch sampling, and cyclically weighted loss. We evaluated our optimizations 
      on simulated distributed diabetic retinopathy detection and chest radiograph 
      classification. RESULTS: Proportional local training iteration mitigated 
      performance losses from sample size variability, achieving 98.6% of the accuracy 
      attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split with 
      highest sample size variance across institutions. Locally weighted minibatch 
      sampling and cyclically weighted loss both mitigated performance losses from 
      label distribution variability, achieving 98.6% and 99.1%, respectively, of the 
      accuracy attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split 
      with highest label distribution variability across institutions. DISCUSSION: Our 
      optimizations to CWT improve its capability of handling data variability across 
      institutions. Compared to CWT without optimizations, CWT with optimizations 
      achieved performance significantly closer to performance from centrally hosting. 
      CONCLUSION: Our work is the first to identify and address challenges of sample 
      size and label distribution variability in simulated distributed deep learning 
      for medical imaging. Future work is needed to address other sources of real-world 
      data variability.

TI  - Fast and Efficient Method for Optical Coherence Tomography Images Classification 
      Using Deep Learning Approach.
LID - 10.3390/s22134675 [doi]
LID - 4675
AB  - The use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in medical diagnostics is now 
      common. The growing amount of data leads us to propose an automated support 
      system for medical staff. The key part of the system is a classification 
      algorithm developed with modern machine learning techniques. The main 
      contribution is to present a new approach for the classification of eye diseases 
      using the convolutional neural network model. The research concerns the 
      classification of patients on the basis of OCT B-scans into one of four 
      categories: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), 
      Drusen, and Normal. Those categories are available in a publicly available 
      dataset of above 84,000 images utilized for the research. After several tested 
      architectures, our 5-layer neural network gives us a promising result. We 
      compared them to the other available solutions which proves the high quality of 
      our algorithm. Equally important for the application of the algorithm is the 
      computational time, which is reduced by the limited size of the model. In 
      addition, the article presents a detailed method of image data augmentation and 
      its impact on the classification results. The results of the experiments were 
      also presented for several derived models of convolutional network architectures 
      that were tested during the research. Improving processes in medical treatment is 
      important. The algorithm cannot replace a doctor but, for example, can be a 
      valuable tool for speeding up the process of diagnosis during screening tests.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is revolutionizing the way we assess eye 
      complications such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD). With its ability to provide layer-by-layer information on the 
      retina, OCT enables the early detection of abnormalities emerging underneath the 
      retinal surface. The latest advancement in this field, OCT angiography (OCTA), 
      takes this to the next level by providing detailed vascular information without 
      requiring dye injections. One of the most significant indicators of DR and AMD is 
      neovascularization, the abnormal growth of unhealthy vessels. In this work, the 
      techniques and algorithms used for the automatic detection, classification, and 
      segmentation of neovascularization in OCTA images are explored. From image 
      processing to machine learning and deep learning, works related to automated 
      image analysis of neovascularization are summarized from different points of 
      view. The problems and future work of each method are also discussed.

TI  - Retinal hemorrhage detection by rule-based and machine learning approach.
PG  - 660-663
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036911 [doi]
AB  - Robust detection of hemorrhages (HMs) in color fundus image is important in an 
      automatic diabetic retinopathy grading system. Detection of the hemorrhages that 
      are close to or connected with retinal blood vessels was found to be challenge. 
      However, most methods didn't put research on it, even some of them mentioned this 
      issue. In this paper, we proposed a novel hemorrhage detection method based on 
      rule-based and machine learning methods. We focused on the improvement of 
      detection of the hemorrhages that are close to or connected with retinal blood 
      vessels, besides detecting the independent hemorrhage regions. A preliminary test 
      for detecting HM presence was conducted on the images from two databases. We 
      achieved sensitivity and specificity of 93.3% and 88% as well as 91.9% and 85.6% 
      on the two datasets.

TI  - DETECTION OF MORPHOLOGIC PATTERNS OF DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA USING A DEEP LEARNING 
      APPROACH BASED ON OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES.
PG  - 1110-1117
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000002992 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning (DL) model to detect morphologic patterns of 
      diabetic macular edema (DME) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. 
      METHODS: In the training set, 12,365 OCT images were extracted from a public data 
      set and an ophthalmic center. A total of 656 OCT images were extracted from 
      another ophthalmic center for external validation. The presence or absence of 
      three OCT patterns of DME, including diffused retinal thickening, cystoid macular 
      edema, and serous retinal detachment, was labeled with 1 or 0, respectively. A DL 
      model was trained to detect three OCT patterns of DME. The occlusion test was 
      applied for the visualization of the DL model. RESULTS: Applying 5-fold 
      cross-validation method in internal validation, the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve for the detection of three OCT patterns (i.e., 
      diffused retinal thickening, cystoid macular edema, and serous retinal 
      detachment) was 0.971, 0.974, and 0.994, respectively, with an accuracy of 93.0%, 
      95.1%, and 98.8%, respectively, a sensitivity of 93.5%, 94.5%, and 96.7%, 
      respectively, and a specificity of 92.3%, 95.6%, and 99.3%, respectively. In 
      external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      was 0.970, 0.997, and 0.997, respectively, with an accuracy of 90.2%, 95.4%, and 
      95.9%, respectively, a sensitivity of 80.1%, 93.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, and 
      a specificity of 97.6%, 97.2%, and 96.5%, respectively. The occlusion test showed 
      that the DL model could successfully identify the pathologic regions most 
      critical for detection. CONCLUSION: Our DL model demonstrated high accuracy and 
      transparency in the detection of OCT patterns of DME. These results emphasized 
      the potential of artificial intelligence in assisting clinical decision-making 
      processes in patients with DME.

      world. Yet despite its wide prevalence, the majority of affected people lack 
      access to the specialized ophthalmologists and equipment required for monitoring 
      their condition. This can lead to delays in the start of treatment, thereby 
      lowering their chances for a successful outcome. Machine learning systems that 
      automatically detect the disease in eye fundus images have been proposed as a 
      means of facilitating access to retinopathy severity estimates for patients in 
      remote regions or even for complementing the human expert's diagnosis. Here we 
      propose a machine learning system for the detection of referable diabetic 
      retinopathy in fundus images, which is based on the paradigm of multiple-instance 
      learning. Our method extracts local information independently from multiple 
      rectangular image patches and combines it efficiently through an attention 
      mechanism that focuses on the abnormal regions of the eye (i.e. those that 
      contain DR-induced lesions), thus resulting in a final image representation that 
      is suitable for classification. Furthermore, by leveraging the attention 
      mechanism our algorithm can seamlessly produce informative heatmaps that 
      highlight the regions where the lesions are located. We evaluate our approach on 
      the publicly available Kaggle, Messidor-2 and IDRiD retinal image datasets, in 
      which it exhibits near state-of-the-art classification performance (AUC of 0.961 
      in Kaggle and 0.976 in Messidor-2), while also producing valid lesion heatmaps 
      (AUPRC of 0.869 in the 81 images of IDRiD that contain pixel-level lesion 
      annotations). Our results suggest that the proposed approach provides an 
      efficient and interpretable solution against the problem of automated diabetic 
      retinopathy grading.

AB  - Poor-quality retinal images do not allow an accurate medical diagnosis, and it is 
      inconvenient for a patient to return to a medical center to repeat the fundus 
      photography exam. In this paper, a robust automatic system is proposed to assess 
      the quality of retinal images at the moment of the acquisition, aiming at 
      assisting health care professionals during a fundus photography exam. We propose 
      a convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on non-medical images for 
      extracting general image features. The weights of the CNN are further adjusted 
      via a fine-tuning procedure, resulting in a performant classifier obtained only 
      with a small quantity of labeled images. The CNN performance was evaluated on two 
      publicly available databases (i.e., DRIMDB and ELSA-Brasil) using two different 
      procedures: intra-database and inter-database cross-validation. The CNN achieved 
      an area under the curve (AUC) of 99.98% on DRIMDB and an AUC of 98.56% on 
      ELSA-Brasil in the inter-database experiment, where training and testing were not 
      performed on the same database. These results show the robustness of the proposed 
      model to various image acquisitions without requiring special adaptation, thus 
      making it a good candidate for use in operational clinical scenarios.

AB  - Classification of abnormalities from medical images using computer-based 
      approaches is of growing interest in medical imaging. Timely detection of 
      abnormalities due to diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration is 
      required in order to prevent the prognosis of the disease. Computer-aided systems 
      using machine learning are becoming interesting to ophthalmologists and 
      researchers. We present here one such technique, the Random Forest classifier, to 
      aid medical practitioners in accurate diagnosis of the diseases. A computer-aided 
      diagnosis system is proposed for detecting retina abnormalities, which combines K 
      means-based segmentation of the retina image, after due preprocessing, followed 
      by machine learning techniques, using several low level and statistical features. 
      Abnormalities in the retina that are classified are caused by age-related macular 
      degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Performance measures used in the analysis 
      are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and Mathew correlation 
      coefficient. A comparison with another machine learning technique, the Naïve 
      Bayes classifier shows that the classification achieved by Random Forest 
      classifier is 93.58% and it outperforms Naïve Bayes classifier which yields an 
      accuracy of 83.63%. Graphical abstract Random Forest classifier for abnormality 
      detection in retina images.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to prospectively quantify the level of 
      agreement among the deep learning system, non-physician graders, and general 
      ophthalmologists with different levels of clinical experience in detecting 
      referable diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and 
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy. METHODS: Deep learning systems for diabetic 
      retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucomatous optic neuropathy 
      classification, with accuracy proven through internal and external validation, 
      were established using 210,473 fundus photographs. Five trained non-physician 
      graders and 47 general ophthalmologists from China were chosen randomly and 
      included in the analysis. A test set of 300 fundus photographs were randomly 
      identified from an independent dataset of 42,388 gradable images. The grading 
      outcomes of five retinal and five glaucoma specialists were used as the reference 
      standard that was considered achieved when ≥50% of gradings were consistent among 
      the included specialists. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve 
      of different groups in relation to the reference standard was used to compare 
      agreement for referable diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. RESULTS: The test set included 45 images 
      (15.0%) with referable diabetic retinopathy, 46 (15.3%) with age-related macular 
      degeneration, 46 (15.3%) with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and 163 (55.4%) 
      without these diseases. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve for 
      non-physician graders, ophthalmologists with 3-5 years of clinical practice, 
      ophthalmologists with 5-10 years of clinical practice, ophthalmologists with 
      >10 years of clinical practice, and the deep learning system for referable 
      diabetic retinopathy were 0.984, 0.964, 0.965, 0.954, and 0.990 (p = 0.415), 
      respectively. The results for referable age-related macular degeneration were 
      0.912, 0.933, 0.946, 0.958, and 0.945, respectively, (p = 0.145), and 0.675, 
      0.862, 0.894, 0.976, and 0.994 for referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy, 
      respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the 
      accuracy of this deep learning system is comparable to that of trained 
      non-physician graders and general ophthalmologists for referable diabetic 
      retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, but the deep learning system 
      performance is better than that of trained non-physician graders for the 
      detection of referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy(DR) is a common early diabetic complication and one of the 
      main causes of blindness. In clinical diagnosis and treatment, regular screening 
      with fundus imaging is an effective way to prevent the development of DR. 
      However, the regular fundus images used in most DR screening work have a small 
      imaging range, narrow field of vision, and can not contain more complete lesion 
      information, which leads to less ideal automatic DR grading results. In order to 
      improve the accuracy of DR grading, we establish a dataset containing 101 
      ultra-wide-field(UWF) DR fundus images and propose a deep learning(DL) automatic 
      classification method based on a new preprocessing method. The emerging UWF 
      fundus images have the advantages of a large imaging range and wide field of 
      vision and contain more information about the lesions. In data preprocessing, we 
      design a data denoising method for UWF images and use data enhancement methods to 
      improve their contrast and brightness to improve the classification effect. In 
      order to verify the efficiency of our dataset and the effectiveness of our 
      preprocessing method, we design a series of experiments including a variety of DL 
      classification models. The experimental results show that we can achieve high 
      classification accuracy by using only the backbone model. The most basic ResNet50 
      model reaches an average of classification accuracy(ACA) 0.66, Macro F1 0.6559, 
      and Kappa 0.58. The best-performing Swin-S model reaches ACA 0.72, Macro F1 
      0.7018, and Kappa 0.65. DR grading using UWF images can achieve higher accuracy 
      and efficiency, which has practical significance and value in clinical 
      applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that has been 
      shown to be as effective as human graders in detecting diabetic retinopathy from 
      fundus photographs. We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the 
      potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current 
      human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before 
      secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without 
      human assessment. METHODS: In this economic analysis modelling study, using 
      39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy 
      screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and 
      TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human 
      graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated 
      screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence 
      rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of 
      medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and 
      specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. 
      Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the 
      results to key model assumptions. FINDINGS: From the health system perspective, 
      the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, 
      at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per 
      year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to 
      the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model 
      are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual 
      screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with 
      diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study provides a strong economic rationale for using deep 
      learning systems as an assistive tool to screen for diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - PURPOSE: We examine the rate of and reasons for follow-up in an Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI)-based workflow for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening relative 
      to two human-based workflows. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A DR screening program 
      initiated September 2019 between one institution and its affiliated primary care 
      and endocrinology clinics screened 2243 adult patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes 
      without a diagnosis of DR in the previous year in the San Francisco Bay Area. For 
      patients who screened positive for more-than-mild-DR (MTMDR), rates of follow-up 
      were calculated under a store-and-forward human-based DR workflow ("Human 
      Workflow"), an AI-based workflow involving IDx-DR ("AI Workflow"), and a two-step 
      hybrid workflow ("AI-Human Hybrid Workflow"). The AI Workflow provided results 
      within 48 hours, whereas the other workflows took up to 7 days. Patients were 
      surveyed by phone about follow-up decisions. RESULTS: Under the AI Workflow, 279 
      patients screened positive for MTMDR. Of these, 69.2% followed up with an 
      ophthalmologist within 90 days. Altogether 70.5% (N=48) of patients who followed 
      up chose their location based on primary care referral. Among the subset of 
      patients that were seen in person at the university eye institute under the Human 
      Workflow and AI-Human Hybrid Workflow, 12.0% (N=14/117) and 11.7% (N=12/103) of 
      patients with a referrable screening result followed up compared to 35.5% of 
      patients under the AI Workflow (N=99/279; χ(2)(df=2) = 36.70, p < 0.00000001). 
      CONCLUSION: Ophthalmology follow-up after a positive DR screening result is 
      approximately three-fold higher under the AI Workflow than either the Human 
      Workflow or AI-Human Hybrid Workflow. Improved follow-up behavior may be due to 
      the decreased time to screening result.

AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) has become more accessible due to technological 
      advancements, making thermal cameras more affordable. Infrared thermal cameras 
      capture the infrared rays emitted by objects and convert it into temperature 
      representations. IRT has emerged as a promising and non-invasive approach for 
      examining the human eye. Ocular surface temperature assessment based on IRT is 
      vital for the diagnosis and monitoring of various eye conditions like dry eye, 
      diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, allergic conjunctivitis, and inflammatory 
      diseases. A collective sum of 192 articles was sourced from various databases, 
      and through adherence to the PRISMA guidelines, 29 articles were ultimately 
      chosen for systematic analysis. This systematic review article seeks to provide 
      readers with a thorough understanding of IRT's applications, advantages, 
      limitations, and recent developments in the context of eye examinations. It 
      covers various aspects of IRT-based eye analysis, including image acquisition, 
      processing techniques, ocular surface temperature measurement, three different 
      approaches to identifying abnormalities, and different evaluation metrics used. 
      Our review also delves into recent advancements, particularly the integration of 
      machine learning and deep learning algorithms into IRT-based eye examinations. 
      Our systematic review not only sheds light on the current state of research but 
      also outlines promising future prospects for the integration of infrared 
      thermography in advancing eye health diagnostics and care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes 
      of preventable blindness in the world. Its earliest sign are red lesions, a 
      general term that groups both microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HEs). In 
      daily clinical practice, these lesions are manually detected by physicians using 
      fundus photographs. However, this task is tedious and time consuming, and 
      requires an intensive effort due to the small size of the lesions and their lack 
      of contrast. Computer-assisted diagnosis of DR based on red lesion detection is 
      being actively explored due to its improvement effects both in clinicians 
      consistency and accuracy. Moreover, it provides comprehensive feedback that is 
      easy to assess by the physicians. Several methods for detecting red lesions have 
      been proposed in the literature, most of them based on characterizing lesion 
      candidates using hand crafted features, and classifying them into true or false 
      positive detections. Deep learning based approaches, by contrast, are scarce in 
      this domain due to the high expense of annotating the lesions manually. METHODS: 
      In this paper we propose a novel method for red lesion detection based on 
      combining both deep learned and domain knowledge. Features learned by a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) are augmented by incorporating hand crafted 
      features. Such ensemble vector of descriptors is used afterwards to identify true 
      lesion candidates using a Random Forest classifier. RESULTS: We empirically 
      observed that combining both sources of information significantly improve results 
      with respect to using each approach separately. Furthermore, our method reported 
      the highest performance on a per-lesion basis on DIARETDB1 and e-ophtha, and for 
      screening and need for referral on MESSIDOR compared to a second human expert. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the fact that integrating manually engineered 
      approaches with deep learned features is relevant to improve results when the 
      networks are trained from lesion-level annotated data. An open source 
      implementation of our system is publicly available at 
      https://github.com/ignaciorlando/red-lesion-detection.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic technology using medical images can 
      be used to increase examination accessibility and support clinical 
      decision-making for screening and diagnosis. To determine a machine learning 
      algorithm for diabetes complications, a literature review of studies using 
      medical image-based AI technology was conducted using the National Library of 
      Medicine PubMed, and the Excerpta Medica databases. Lists of studies using 
      diabetes diagnostic images and AI as keywords were combined. In total, 227 
      appropriate studies were selected. Diabetic retinopathy studies using the AI 
      model were the most frequent (85.0%, 193/227 cases), followed by diabetic foot 
      (7.9%, 18/227 cases) and diabetic neuropathy (2.7%, 6/227 cases). The studies 
      used open datasets (42.3%, 96/227 cases) or directly constructed data from 
      fundoscopy or optical coherence tomography (57.7%, 131/227 cases). Major 
      limitations in AI-based detection of diabetes complications using medical images 
      were the lack of datasets (36.1%, 82/227 cases) and severity misclassification 
      (26.4%, 60/227 cases). Although it remains difficult to use and fully trust 
      AI-based imaging analysis technology clinically, it reduces clinicians' time and 
      labor, and the expectations from its decision-support roles are high. Various 
      data collection and synthesis data technology developments according to the 
      disease severity are required to solve data imbalance.

AB  - The cardinal symptoms of some ophthalmic diseases observed through exceptional 
      retinal blood vessels, such as retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, etc. 
      The advanced deep learning models used to obtain morphological and structural 
      information of blood vessels automatically are conducive to the early treatment 
      and initiative prevention of ophthalmic diseases. In our work, we propose a 
      hierarchical dilation convolutional network (HDC-Net) to extract retinal vessels 
      in a pixel-to-pixel manner. It utilizes the hierarchical dilation convolution 
      (HDC) module to capture the fragile retinal blood vessels usually neglected by 
      other methods. An improved residual dual efficient channel attention (RDECA) 
      module can infer more delicate channel information to reinforce the 
      discriminative capability of the model. The structured Dropblock can help our 
      HDC-Net model to solve the network overfitting effectively. From a holistic 
      perspective, the segmentation results obtained by HDC-Net are superior to other 
      deep learning methods on three acknowledged datasets (DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, STARE), 
      the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, f1-score and AUC score are {0.8252, 
      0.9829, 0.9692, 0.8239, 0.9871}, {0.8227, 0.9853, 0.9745, 0.8113, 0.9884}, and 
      {0.8369, 0.9866, 0.9751, 0.8385, 0.9913}, respectively. It surpasses most other 
      advanced retinal vessel segmentation models. Qualitative and quantitative 
      analysis demonstrates that HDC-Net can fulfill the task of retinal vessel 
      segmentation efficiently and accurately.

AB  - The leading cause of vision loss globally is diabetic retinopathy. Researchers 
      are making great efforts to automatically detect and diagnose correctly diabetic 
      retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy includes five stages: no diabetic retinopathy, 
      mild diabetic retinopathy, moderate diabetic retinopathy, severe diabetic 
      retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Recent studies have offered 
      several multi-tasking deep learning models to detect and assess the level of 
      diabetic retinopathy. However, the explanation for the assessment of disease 
      severity of these models is limited, and only stops at showing lesions through 
      images. These studies have not explained on what basis the appraisal of disease 
      severity is based. In this article, we present a system for assessing and 
      interpreting the five stages of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed system is 
      built from internal models including a deep learning model that detects lesions 
      and an explanatory model that assesses disease stage. The deep learning model 
      that detects lesions uses the Mask R-CNN deep learning network to specify the 
      location and shape of the lesion and classify the lesion types. This model is a 
      combination of two networks: one used to detect hemorrhagic and exudative 
      lesions, and one used to detect vascular lesions like aneurysm and proliferation. 
      The explanatory model appraises disease severity based on the severity of each 
      type of lesion and the association between types. The severity of the disease 
      will be decided by the model based on the number of lesions, the density and the 
      area of the lesions. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that 
      our proposed method achieves high accuracy of assessing five stages of diabetic 
      retinopathy comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods and is capable of 
      explaining the causes of disease severity.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication that arises due to 
      diabetes, and it affects the retina. It is the leading cause of blindness 
      globally, and early detection can protect patients from losing sight. However, 
      the early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy is an difficult task that needs 
      clinical experts' interpretation of fundus images. In this study, a deep learning 
      model was trained and validated on a private dataset and tested in real time at 
      the Sindh Institute of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences (SIOVS). The intelligent 
      model evaluated the quality of the test images. The implemented model classified 
      the test images into DR-Positive and DR-Negative ones. Furthermore, the results 
      were reviewed by clinical experts to assess the model's performance. A total 
      number of 398 patients, including 232 male and 166 female patients, were screened 
      for five weeks. The model achieves 93.72% accuracy, 97.30% sensitivity, and 
      92.90% specificity on the test data as labelled by clinical experts on Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.

AB  - The estimated 30 million children and adults are suffering with diabetes across 
      the world. A person with diabetes can recognize several symptoms, and it can also 
      be tested using retina image as diabetes also affects the human eye. The doctor 
      is usually able to detect retinal changes quickly and can help prevent vision 
      loss. Therefore, regular eye examinations are very important. Diabetes is a 
      chronic disease that affects various parts of the human body including the 
      retina. It can also be considered as major cause for blindness in developed 
      countries. This paper deals with classification of retinal image into diabetes or 
      not with the help of deep learning algorithms and architecture. Hence, deep 
      learning is beneficial for classification of medical images specifically such a 
      complex image of human retina. A large number of image data are considered 
      throughout the project on which classification is performed by using binary 
      classifier. On applying certain deep learning algorithms, model results into the 
      training accuracy of 96.68% and validation accuracy of 66.82%. Diabetic 
      retinopathy can be considered as an effective and efficient method for diabetes 
      detection.

AB  - To assess the feasibility of code-free deep learning (CFDL) platforms in the 
      prediction of binary outcomes from fundus images in ophthalmology, evaluating two 
      distinct online-based platforms (Google Vertex and Amazon Rekognition), and two 
      distinct datasets. Two publicly available datasets, Messidor-2 and BRSET, were 
      utilized for model development. The Messidor-2 consists of fundus photographs 
      from diabetic patients and the BRSET is a multi-label dataset. The CFDL platforms 
      were used to create deep learning models, with no preprocessing of the images, by 
      a single ophthalmologist without coding expertise. The performance metrics 
      employed to evaluate the models were F1 score, area under curve (AUC), precision 
      and recall. The performance metrics for referable diabetic retinopathy and 
      macular edema were above 0.9 for both tasks and CDFL. The Google Vertex models 
      demonstrated superior performance compared to the Amazon models, with the BRSET 
      dataset achieving the highest accuracy (AUC of 0.994). Multi-classification tasks 
      using only BRSET achieved similar overall performance between platforms, 
      achieving AUC of 0.994 for laterality, 0.942 for age grouping, 0.779 for genetic 
      sex identification, 0.857 for optic, and 0.837 for normality with Google Vertex. 
      The study demonstrates the feasibility of using automated machine learning 
      platforms for predicting binary outcomes from fundus images in ophthalmology. It 
      highlights the high accuracy achieved by the models in some tasks and the 
      potential of CFDL as an entry-friendly platform for ophthalmologists to 
      familiarize themselves with machine learning concepts.

AB  - Geographic atrophy (GA) is a vision-threatening manifestation of age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness globally. 
      Objective, rapid, reliable, and scalable quantification of GA from optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) retinal scans is necessary for disease monitoring, 
      prognostic research, and clinical endpoints for therapy development. Such 
      automatically quantified biomarkers on OCT are likely to further elucidate 
      structure-function correlation in GA and thus the pathophysiological mechanisms 
      of disease development and progression. In this work, we aimed to predict visual 
      function with machine-learning applied to automatically acquired quantitative 
      imaging biomarkers in GA. A post-hoc analysis of data from a clinical trial and 
      routine clinical care was conducted. A deep-learning automated segmentation model 
      was applied on OCT scans from 476 eyes (325 patients) with GA. A separate machine 
      learning prediction model (Random Forest) used the resultant quantitative OCT 
      (qOCT) biomarkers to predict cross-sectional visual acuity under standard (VA) 
      and low luminance (LLVA). The primary outcome was regression coefficient (r(2)) 
      and mean absolute error (MAE) for cross-sectional VA and LLVA in Early Treatment 
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. OCT parameters were predictive of VA 
      (r(2) 0.40 MAE 11.7 ETDRS letters) and LLVA (r(2) 0.25 MAE 12.1). Normalised 
      random forest feature importance, as a measure of the predictive value of the 
      three constituent features of GA; retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-loss, 
      photoreceptor degeneration (PDR), hypertransmission and their locations, was 
      reported both on voxel-level heatmaps and ETDRS-grid subfields. The foveal region 
      (46.5%) and RPE-loss (31.1%) had greatest predictive importance for VA. For LLVA, 
      however, non-foveal regions (74.5%) and PDR (38.9%) were most important. In 
      conclusion, automated qOCT biomarkers demonstrate predictive significance for VA 
      and LLVA in GA. LLVA is itself predictive of GA progression, implying that the 
      predictive qOCT biomarkers provided by our model are also prognostic.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the main causes of blindness in people around 
      the world. Early diagnosis and treatment of DR can be accomplished by organizing 
      large regular screening programs. Still, it is difficult to spot diabetic 
      retinopathy timely because the situation might not indicate signs in the primary 
      stages of the disease. Due to a drastic increase in diabetic patients, there is 
      an urgent need for efficient diabetic retinopathy detecting systems. 
      Auto-encoders, sparse coding, and limited Boltzmann machines were used as a few 
      past deep learning (DL) techniques and features for the classification of DR. 
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been identified as a promising solution 
      for detecting and classifying DR. We employ the deep learning capabilities of 
      efficient net batch normalization (BNs) pre-trained models to automatically 
      acquire discriminative features from fundus images. However, we successfully 
      achieved F1 scores above 80% on all efficient net BNs in the EYE-PACS dataset 
      (calculated F1 score for DeepDRiD another dataset) and the results are better 
      than previous studies. In this paper, we improved the accuracy and F1 score of 
      the efficient net BNs pre-trained models on the EYE-PACS dataset by applying a 
      Gaussian Smooth filter and data augmentation transforms. Using our proposed 
      technique, we have achieved F1 scores of 84% and 87% for EYE-PACS and DeepDRiD.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness in middle-age 
      subjects and low DR screening rates demonstrates the need for an automated image 
      assessment system, which can benefit from the development of deep learning 
      techniques. Therefore, the effective classification performance is significant in 
      favor of the referable DR identification task. In this paper, we propose a new 
      strategy, which applies multiple weighted paths into convolutional neural 
      network, called the WP-CNN, motivated by the ensemble learning. In WP-CNN, 
      multiple path weight coefficients are optimized by back propagation, and the 
      output features are averaged for redundancy reduction and fast convergence. The 
      experiment results show that with the efficient training convergence rate WP-CNN 
      achieves an accuracy of 94.23% with sensitivity of 90.94%, specificity of 95.74%, 
      an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.9823 and F1-score of 0.9087. By 
      taking full advantage of the multipath mechanism, the proposed WP-CNN is shown to 
      be accurate and effective for referable DR identification compared to the 
      state-of-art algorithms.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although optical coherence tomography (OCT) is essential for 
      ophthalmologists, reading of findings requires expertise. The purpose of this 
      study is to test deep learning with image augmentation for automated detection of 
      chorioretinal diseases. METHODS: A retina specialist diagnosed 1,200 OCT images. 
      The diagnoses involved normal eyes (n=570) and those with wet age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) (n=136), diabetic retinopathy (DR) (n=104), epiretinal 
      membranes (ERMs) (n=90), and another 19 diseases. Among them, 1,100 images were 
      used for deep learning training, augmented to 59,400 by horizontal flipping, 
      rotation, and translation. The remaining 100 images were used to evaluate the 
      trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. RESULTS: Automated disease 
      detection showed that the first candidate disease corresponded to the doctor's 
      decision in 83 (83%) images and the second candidate disease in seven (7%) 
      images. The precision and recall of the CNN model were 0.85 and 0.97 for normal 
      eyes, 1.00 and 0.77 for wet AMD, 0.78 and 1.00 for DR, and 0.75 and 0.75 for 
      ERMs, respectively. Some of rare diseases such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease 
      were correctly detected by image augmentation in the CNN training. CONCLUSION: 
      Automated detection of macular diseases from OCT images might be feasible using 
      the CNN model. Image augmentation might be effective to compensate for a small 
      image number for training.

TI  - A New Approach for Detecting Fundus Lesions Using Image Processing and Deep 
      Neural Network Architecture Based on YOLO Model.
LID - 10.3390/s22176441 [doi]
LID - 6441
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the main causes of vision loss, and in its initial 
      stages, it presents with fundus lesions, such as microaneurysms, hard exudates, 
      hemorrhages, and soft exudates. Computational models capable of detecting these 
      lesions can help in the early diagnosis of the disease and prevent the 
      manifestation of more severe forms of lesions, helping in screening and defining 
      the best form of treatment. However, the detection of these lesions through 
      computerized systems is a challenge due to numerous factors, such as the 
      characteristics of size and shape of the lesions, noise and the contrast of 
      images available in the public datasets of Diabetic Retinopathy, the number of 
      labeled examples of these lesions available in the datasets and the difficulty of 
      deep learning algorithms in detecting very small objects in digital images. Thus, 
      to overcome these problems, this work proposes a new approach based on image 
      processing techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and deep neural 
      networks to assist in the medical diagnosis of fundus lesions. The proposed 
      approach was trained, adjusted, and tested using the public DDR and IDRiD 
      Diabetic Retinopathy datasets and implemented in the PyTorch framework based on 
      the YOLOv5 model. The proposed approach reached in the DDR dataset an mAP of 
      0.2630 for the IoU limit of 0.5 and F1-score of 0.3485 in the validation stage, 
      and an mAP of 0.1540 for the IoU limit of 0.5 and F1-score of 0.2521, in the test 
      stage. The results obtained in the experiments demonstrate that the proposed 
      approach presented superior results to works with the same purpose found in the

TI  - Prospective evaluation of an artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm for 
      automated diabetic retinopathy screening of 30 000 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Human grading of digital images from diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      screening programmes represents a significant challenge, due to the increasing 
      prevalence of diabetes. We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial 
      intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic 
      Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus 
      test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the 
      reference standard. METHODS: Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening 
      episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard 
      national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled 
      software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and 
      diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference 
      standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for 
      referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, 
      moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises 
      sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative 
      retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe 
      non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. 
      EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 
      69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with 
      non-referable retinopathy. CONCLUSION: The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of 
      sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with 
      specificity that could halve the workload for human graders. AI machine learning 
      and deep learning algorithms such as this can provide clinically equivalent, 
      rapid detection of retinopathy, particularly in settings where a trained 
      workforce is unavailable or where large-scale and rapid results are needed.

TI  - Predicting optical coherence tomography-derived diabetic macular edema grades 
      from fundus photographs using deep learning.

AB  - Center-involved diabetic macular edema (ci-DME) is a major cause of vision loss. 
      Although the gold standard for diagnosis involves 3D imaging, 2D imaging by 
      fundus photography is usually used in screening settings, resulting in high 
      false-positive and false-negative calls. To address this, we train a deep 
      learning model to predict ci-DME from fundus photographs, with an ROC-AUC of 0.89 
      (95% CI: 0.87-0.91), corresponding to 85% sensitivity at 80% specificity. In 
      comparison, retinal specialists have similar sensitivities (82-85%), but only 
      half the specificity (45-50%, p < 0.001). Our model can also detect the presence 
      of intraretinal fluid (AUC: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.81-0.86) and subretinal fluid (AUC 
      0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.91). Using deep learning to make predictions via simple 2D 
      images without sophisticated 3D-imaging equipment and with better than specialist 
      performance, has broad relevance to many other applications in medical imaging.

TI  - Cross-camera Performance of Deep Learning Algorithms to Diagnose Common 
      Ophthalmic Diseases: A Comparative Study Highlighting Feasibility to Portable 
      Fundus Camera Use.
PG  - 857-863
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2023.2215984 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the inter-camera performance and consistency of various deep 
      learning (DL) diagnostic algorithms applied to fundus images taken from desktop 
      Topcon and portable Optain cameras. METHODS: Participants over 18 years of age 
      were enrolled between November 2021 and April 2022. Pair-wise fundus photographs 
      from each patient were collected in a single visit; once by Topcon (used as the 
      reference camera) and once by a portable Optain camera (the new target camera). 
      These were analyzed by three previously validated DL models for the detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and 
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). Ophthalmologists manually analyzed all 
      fundus photos for the presence of DR and these were referred to as the ground 
      truth. Sensitivity, specificity, the area under the curve (AUC) and agreement 
      between cameras (estimated by Cohen's weighted kappa, K) were the primary 
      outcomes of this study. RESULTS: A total of 504 patients were recruited. After 
      excluding 12 photographs with matching errors and 59 photographs with low 
      quality, 906 pairs of Topcon-Optain fundus photos were available for algorithm 
      assessment. Topcon and Optain cameras had excellent consistency (Κ=0.80) when 
      applied to the referable DR algorithm, while AMD had moderate consistency 
      (Κ=0.41) and GON had poor consistency (Κ=0.32). For the DR model, Topcon and 
      Optain achieved a sensitivity of 97.70% and 97.67% and a specificity of 97.92% 
      and 97.93%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two 
      camera models (McNemar's test: x(2)=0.08, p = .78). CONCLUSION: Topcon and Optain 
      cameras had excellent consistency for detecting referable DR, albeit performances 
      for detecting AMD and GON models were unsatisfactory. This study highlights the 
      methods of using pair-wise images to evaluate DL models between reference and new 
      fundus cameras.

AB  - Diabetes is a long-term condition in which the pancreas quits producing insulin 
      or the body's insulin isn't utilised properly. One of the signs of diabetes is 
      Diabetic Retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is the most prevalent type of 
      diabetes, if remains unaddressed, diabetic retinopathy can affect all diabetics 
      and become very serious, raising the chances of blindness. It is a chronic 
      systemic condition that affects up to 80% of patients for more than ten years. 
      Many researchers believe that if diabetes individuals are diagnosed early enough, 
      they can be rescued from the condition in 90% of cases. Diabetes damages the 
      capillaries, which are microscopic blood vessels in the retina. On images, blood 
      vessel damage is usually noticeable. Therefore, in this study, several 
      traditional, as well as deep learning-based approaches, are reviewed for the 
      classification and detection of this particular diabetic-based eye disease known 
      as diabetic retinopathy, and also the advantage of one approach over the other is 
      also described. Along with the approaches, the dataset and the evaluation metrics 
      useful for DR detection and classification are also discussed. The main finding 
      of this study is to aware researchers about the different challenges occurs while 
      detecting diabetic retinopathy using computer vision, deep learning techniques. 
      Therefore, a purpose of this review paper is to sum up all the major aspects 
      while detecting DR like lesion identification, classification and segmentation, 
      security attacks on the deep learning models, proper categorization of datasets 
      and evaluation metrics. As deep learning models are quite expensive and more 
      prone to security attacks thus, in future it is advisable to develop a refined, 
      reliable and robust model which overcomes all these aspects which are commonly 
      found while designing deep learning models.

TI  - Data Diversity in Convolutional Neural Network Based Ensemble Model for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.

AB  - The medical and healthcare domains require automatic diagnosis systems (ADS) for 
      the identification of health problems with technological advancements. Biomedical 
      imaging is one of the techniques used in computer-aided diagnosis systems. 
      Ophthalmologists examine fundus images (FI) to detect and classify stages of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is a chronic disease that appears in patients with 
      long-term diabetes. Unattained patients can lead to severe conditions of DR, such 
      as retinal eye detachments. Therefore, early detection and classification of DR 
      are crucial to ward off advanced stages of DR and preserve the vision. Data 
      diversity in an ensemble model refers to the use of multiple models trained on 
      different subsets of data to improve the ensemble's overall performance. In the 
      context of an ensemble model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for 
      diabetic retinopathy, this could involve training multiple CNNs on various 
      subsets of retinal images, including images from different patients or those 
      captured using distinct imaging techniques. By combining the predictions of these 
      multiple models, the ensemble model can potentially make more accurate 
      predictions than a single prediction. In this paper, an ensemble model (EM) of 
      three CNN models is proposed for limited and imbalanced DR data using data 
      diversity. Detecting the Class 1 stage of DR is important to control this fatal 
      disease in time. CNN-based EM is incorporated to classify the five classes of DR 
      while giving attention to the early stage, i.e., Class 1. Furthermore, data 
      diversity is created by applying various augmentation and generation techniques 
      with affine transformation. Compared to the single model and other existing work, 
      the proposed EM has achieved better multi-class classification accuracy, 
      precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.06%, 91.00%, 95.01%, and 98.38%, 
      respectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of an automated 
      artificial intelligence-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) algorithm with two 
      retinal imaging systems using two different technologies: a conventional flash 
      fundus camera and a white LED confocal scanner. METHODS: On the same day, 
      patients underwent dilated colour fundus photography using both a conventional 
      flash fundus camera (TRC-NW8, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a fully 
      automated white LED confocal scanner (Eidon, Centervue, Padova, Italy). All 
      images were analysed for DR severity both by retina specialists and the AI 
      software EyeArt (Eyenuk Inc., Los Angeles, CA) and graded as referable DR (RDR) 
      or not RDR. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) were 
      computed. RESULTS: A series of 165 diabetic subjects (330 eyes) were enrolled. 
      The automated algorithm achieved 90.8% sensitivity with 75.3% specificity on 
      images acquired with the conventional fundus camera and 94.1% sensitivity with 
      86.8% specificity on images obtained from the white LED confocal scanner. The 
      difference between AUC was 0.0737 (p = 0.0023). CONCLUSION: The automated image 
      analysis software is well suited to work with different imaging technologies. It 
      achieved a better diagnostic performance when the white LED confocal scanner is 
      used. Further evaluation in the context of screening campaigns is needed.

AB  - PURPOSE: An observational study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the 
      Medios smartphone-based offline deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) 
      software to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared with the image diagnosis of 
      ophthalmologists. METHODS: Patients attending the outpatient services of a 
      tertiary center for diabetes care underwent 3-field dilated retinal imaging using 
      the Remidio NM FOP 10. Two fellowship-trained vitreoretinal specialists 
      separately graded anonymized images and a patient-level diagnosis was reached 
      based on grading of the worse eye. The images were subjected to offline grading 
      using the Medios integrated AI-based software on the same smartphone used to 
      acquire images. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI in detecting referable 
      DR (moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse disease) was compared to the 
      gold standard diagnosis of the retina specialists. RESULTS: Results include 
      analysis of images from 297 patients of which 176 (59.2%) had no DR, 35 (11.7%) 
      had mild NPDR, 41 (13.8%) had moderate NPDR, and 33 (11.1%) had severe NPDR. In 
      addition, 12 (4%) patients had PDR and 36 (20.4%) had macular edema. Sensitivity 
      and specificity of the AI in detecting referable DR was 98.84% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 97.62-100%) and 86.73% (95% CI, 82.87-90.59%), respectively. The 
      area under the curve was 0.92. The sensitivity for vision-threatening DR (VTDR) 
      was 100%. CONCLUSION: The AI-based software had high sensitivity and specificity 
      in detecting referable DR. Integration with the smartphone-based fundus camera 
      with offline image grading has the potential for widespread applications in 
      resource-poor settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning-based method to achieve vessel segmentation 
      and measurement on fundus images, and explore the quantitative relationships 
      between retinal vascular characteristics and the clinical indicators of renal 
      function. METHODS: We recruited patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with 
      different stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR), collecting their fundus 
      photographs and results of renal function tests. A deep learning framework for 
      retinal vessel segmentation and measurement was developed. The correlation 
      between the renal function indicators and the severity of DR were explored, then 
      the correlation coefficients between indicators of renal function and retinal 
      vascular characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 418 patients (eyes) 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The albumin to creatinine ratio, blood uric acid, 
      blood creatinine, blood albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were 
      significantly correlated with the progression of DR (P < 0.05); no correlation 
      existed in other metrics (P > 0.05). The fractal dimension was found to 
      significantly correlate with most of the clinical parameters of renal function (P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The albumin to creatinine ratio, blood uric acid, blood 
      creatinine, blood albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate have 
      significant correlation with the progression of moderate to proliferative DR. 
      Through deep learning-based vessel segmentation and measurement, the fractal 
      dimension was found to significantly correlate with most clinical parameters of 
      renal function. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Deep learning-based vessel segmentation 
      and measurement on color fundus photographs could explore the relationships 
      between retinal characteristics and renal function, facilitating earlier 
      detection and intervention of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications.

      (ME) research Between 2011 and 2022 and performed modeling, quantitative, and 
      qualitative investigations. Methods: On 1st February 2023, we screened the Web of 
      Science Core Collection for AI applications related to ME, from which 297 studies 
      were identified and analyzed (2011-2022). We collected information on: 
      publications, institutions, country/region, keywords, journal name, references, 
      and research hotspots. Literature clustering networks and Frontier knowledge 
      bases were investigated using bibliometrix-BiblioShiny, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace 
      bibliometric platforms. We used the R "bibliometrix" package to synopsize our 
      observations, enumerate keywords, visualize collaboration networks between 
      countries/regions, and generate a topic trends plot. VOSviewer was used to 
      examine cooperation between institutions and identify citation relationships 
      between journals. We used CiteSpace to identify clustering keywords over the 
      timeline and identify keywords with the strongest citation bursts. Results: In 
      total, 47 countries published AI studies related to ME; the United States had the 
      highest H-index, thus the greatest influence. China and the United States 
      cooperated most closely between all countries. Also, 613 institutions generated 
      publications - the Medical University of Vienna had the highest number of 
      studies. This publication record and H-index meant the university was the most 
      influential in the ME field. Reference clusters were also categorized into 10 
      headings: retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) fluid detection, 
      convolutional network models, deep learning (DL)-based single-shot predictions, 
      retinal vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy (DR), convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs), automated macular pathology diagnosis, dry age-related macular 
      degeneration (DARMD), class weight, and advanced DL architecture systems. 
      Frontier keywords were represented by diabetic macular edema (DME) (2021-2022). 
      Conclusion: Our review of the AI-related ME literature was comprehensive, 
      systematic, and objective, and identified future trends and current hotspots. 
      With increased DL outputs, the ME research focus has gradually shifted from 
      manual ME examinations to automatic ME detection and associated symptoms. In this 
      review, we present a comprehensive and dynamic overview of AI in ME and identify 
      future research areas.

AB  - There are almost two million people in the United Kingdom living with sight loss, 
      including around 360,000 people who are registered as blind or partially sighted. 
      Sight threatening diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and age related macular 
      degeneration have contributed to the 40% increase in outpatient attendances in 
      the last decade but are amenable to early detection and monitoring. With early 
      and appropriate intervention, blindness may be prevented in many cases. 
      Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively assess the 
      progression of a number of pathologies including neovascular ("wet") age-related 
      macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. Two methods of imaging 
      are commonly used: digital photographs of the fundus (the 'back' of the eye) and 
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT, a modality that uses light waves in a similar 
      way to how ultrasound uses sound waves). Changes in population demographics and 
      expectations and the changing pattern of chronic diseases creates a rising demand 
      for such imaging. Meanwhile, interrogation of such images is time consuming, 
      costly, and prone to human error. The application of novel analysis methods may 
      provide a solution to these challenges. This research will focus on applying 
      novel machine learning algorithms to automatic analysis of both digital fundus 
      photographs and OCT in Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust patients. 
      Through analysis of the images used in ophthalmology, along with relevant 
      clinical and demographic information, DeepMind Health will investigate the 
      feasibility of automated grading of digital fundus photographs and OCT and 
      provide novel quantitative measures for specific disease features and for 
      monitoring the therapeutic success.

AB  - Deep learning in medical image analysis has indicated increasing interest in the 
      classification of signs of abnormalities. In this study, a new convolutional 
      neural network (CNN) architecture (MIDNet18) Medical Image Detection Network was 
      proposed for the classification of retinal diseases using optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) images. The model consists of 14 convolutional layers, seven Max 
      Pooling layers, four dense layers, and one classification layer. A multi-class 
      classification layer in the MIDNet18 is used to classify the OCT images into 
      either normal or any of the three abnormal types: Choroidal Neovascularization 
      (CNV), Drusen, and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The dataset consists of 83,484 
      training images, 41,741 validation images, and 968 test images. According to the 
      experimental results, MIDNet18 obtains an accuracy of 98.86%, and their 
      performances are compared with other standard CNN models; ResNet-50 (83.26%), 
      MobileNet (93.29%) and DenseNet (92.5%). Also, MIDNet18 with a p-value < 0.001 
      has been proved to be statistically significant than other standard CNN 
      architectures in classifying retinal diseases using OCT images.

AB  - Deep learning emerges as a powerful tool for analyzing medical images. Retinal 
      disease detection by using computer-aided diagnosis from fundus image has emerged 
      as a new method. We applied deep learning convolutional neural network by using 
      MatConvNet for an automated detection of multiple retinal diseases with fundus 
      photographs involved in STructured Analysis of the REtina (STARE) database. 
      Dataset was built by expanding data on 10 categories, including normal retina and 
      nine retinal diseases. The optimal outcomes were acquired by using a random 
      forest transfer learning based on VGG-19 architecture. The classification results 
      depended greatly on the number of categories. As the number of categories 
      increased, the performance of deep learning models was diminished. When all 10 
      categories were included, we obtained results with an accuracy of 30.5%, relative 
      classifier information (RCI) of 0.052, and Cohen's kappa of 0.224. Considering 
      three integrated normal, background diabetic retinopathy, and dry age-related 
      macular degeneration, the multi-categorical classifier showed accuracy of 72.8%, 
      0.283 RCI, and 0.577 kappa. In addition, several ensemble classifiers enhanced 
      the multi-categorical classification performance. The transfer learning 
      incorporated with ensemble classifier of clustering and voting approach presented 
      the best performance with accuracy of 36.7%, 0.053 RCI, and 0.225 kappa in the 10 
      retinal diseases classification problem. First, due to the small size of 
      datasets, the deep learning techniques in this study were ineffective to be 
      applied in clinics where numerous patients suffering from various types of 
      retinal disorders visit for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we found that the 
      transfer learning incorporated with ensemble classifiers can improve the 
      classification performance in order to detect multi-categorical retinal diseases. 
      Further studies should confirm the effectiveness of algorithms with large 
      datasets obtained from hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Convolution neural networks have been considered for automatic 
      analysis of fundus images to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy but suffer from 
      low sensitivity. METHODS: This study has proposed an alternate method using 
      probabilistic output from Convolution neural network to automatically and 
      simultaneously detect exudates, hemorrhages and microaneurysms. The method was 
      evaluated using two approaches: patch and image-based analysis of the fundus 
      images on two public databases: DIARETDB1 and e-Ophtha. The novelty of the 
      proposed method is that the images were analyzed using probability maps generated 
      by score values of the softmax layer instead of the use of the binary output. 
      RESULTS: The sensitivity of the proposed approach was 0.96, 0.84 and 0.85 for 
      detection of exudates, hemorrhages and microaneurysms, respectively when 
      considering patch-based analysis. The results show overall accuracy for DIARETDB1 
      was 97.3% and 86.6% for e-Ophtha. The error rate for image-based analysis was 
      also significantly reduced when compared with other works. CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed method provides the framework for convolution neural network-based 
      analysis of fundus images to identify exudates, hemorrhages, and microaneurysms. 
      It obtained accuracy and sensitivity which were significantly better than the 
      reported studies and makes it suitable for automatic diabetic retinopathy signs 
      detection.

      macular edema etc. Among these retinal diseases, DR can lead to vision detachment 
      in diabetic patients which cause swelling of these retinal blood vessels or even 
      can create new vessels. This creation or the new vessels and swelling can be 
      analyzed as biomarker for screening and analysis of DR. Deep learning-based 
      semantic segmentation of these vessels can be an effective tool to detect changes 
      in retinal vasculature for diagnostic purposes. This segmentation task becomes 
      challenging because of the low-quality retinal images with different image 
      acquisition conditions, and intensity variations. Existing retinal blood vessels 
      segmentation methods require a large number of trainable parameters for training 
      of their networks. This paper introduces a novel Dense Aggregation Vessel 
      Segmentation Network (DAVS-Net), which can achieve high segmentation performance 
      with only a few trainable parameters. For faster convergence, this network uses 
      an encoder-decoder framework in which edge information is transferred from the 
      first layers of the encoder to the last layer of the decoder. Performance of the 
      proposed network is evaluated on publicly available retinal blood vessels 
      datasets of DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE. Proposed method achieved 
      state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy using a few number of trainable 
      parameters.

TI  - MSGANet-RAV: A multiscale guided attention network for artery-vein segmentation 
      and classification from optic disc and retinal images.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinal and optic disc images are used to assess changes in the 
      retinal vasculature. These can be changes associated with diseases such as 
      diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma or induced using ophthalmodynamometry to 
      measure arterial and venous pressure. Key steps toward automating the assessment 
      of these changes are the segmentation and classification of the veins and 
      arteries. However, such segmentation and classification are still required to be 
      manually labelled by experts. Such automated labelling is challenging because of 
      the complex morphology, anatomical variations, alterations due to disease and 
      scarcity of labelled data for algorithm development. We present a deep machine 
      learning solution called the multiscale guided attention network for retinal 
      artery and vein segmentation and classification (MSGANet-RAV). METHODS: 
      MSGANet-RAV was developed and tested on 383 colour clinical optic disc images 
      from LEI-CENTRAL, constructed in-house and 40 colour fundus images from the 
      AV-DRIVE public dataset. The datasets have a mean optic disc occupancy per image 
      of 60.6% and 2.18%, respectively. MSGANet-RAV is a U-shaped encoder-decoder 
      network, where the encoder extracts multiscale features, and the decoder includes 
      a sequence of self-attention modules. The self-attention modules explore, guide 
      and incorporate vessel-specific structural and contextual feature information to 
      segment and classify central optic disc and retinal vessel pixels. RESULTS: 
      MSGANet-RAV achieved a pixel classification accuracy of 93.15%, sensitivity of 
      92.19%, and specificity of 94.13% on LEI-CENTRAL, outperforming several reference 
      models. It similarly performed highly on AV-DRIVE with an accuracy, sensitivity 
      and specificity of 95.48%, 93.59% and 97.27%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 
      results show the efficacy of MSGANet-RAV for identifying central optic disc and 
      retinal arteries and veins. The method can be used in automated systems designed 
      to assess vascular changes in retinal and optic disc images quantitatively.

TI  - SYSTEMATIC CORRELATION OF CENTRAL SUBFIELD THICKNESS WITH RETINAL FLUID VOLUMES 
      QUANTIFIED BY DEEP LEARNING IN THE MAJOR EXUDATIVE MACULAR DISEASES.
PG  - 831-841
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000003385 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation of volumetric measurements of 
      intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid obtained by deep learning and central 
      retinal subfield thickness (CSFT) based on optical coherence tomography in 
      retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema, and neovascular age-related 
      macular degeneration. METHODS: A previously validated deep learning-based 
      approach was used for automated segmentation of IRF and subretinal fluid in 
      spectral domain optical coherence tomography images. Optical coherence tomography 
      volumes of 2.433 patients obtained from multicenter studies were analyzed. Fluid 
      volumes were measured at baseline and under antivascular endothelial growth 
      factor therapy in the central 1, 3, and 6 mm. RESULTS: Patients with neovascular 
      age-related macular degeneration generally demonstrated the weakest association 
      between CSFT and fluid volume measurements in the central 1 mm (0.107-0.569). In 
      patients with diabetic macular edema, IRF correlated moderately with CSFT 
      (0.668-0.797). In patients with retinal vein occlusion, IRF volumes showed a 
      moderate correlation with CSFT (0.603-0.704). CONCLUSION: The correlation of CSFT 
      and fluid volumes depends on the underlying pathology. Although the amount of 
      central IRF seems to partly drive CSFT in diabetic macular edema and retinal vein 
      occlusion, it has only a limited impact on patients with neovascular age-related 
      macular degeneration. Our findings do not support the use of CSFT as a primary or 
      secondary outcome measure for the quantification of exudative activity or 
      treatment guidance.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common health concern. Unfortunately, the 
      metabolic pathway causing DR is yet to be understood. The carotenoid level in the 
      human body is known to protect the health of the eyes. In this work, resonance 
      Raman spectroscopy and multivariate analysis of the spectral data of human serum 
      are reported as next-generation spectropathologic tools to detect retinal 
      degeneration efficiently. The proposed technique shows promise by endorsing 
      ocular carotenoids as a critical biomarker for such pathosis. Furthermore, the 
      multivariate analysis of the spectral data distinguishes between two different 
      stages of the disease. The machine learning algorithm is used to estimate a 
      significant accuracy of 94% of the proposed model for the classification. As the 
      carotenoid level can be controlled by dietary intake, we believe that the 
      reported results also indicate a therapeutic role of the same in DR.

AB  - AIM: To explore the latest application of artificial intelligence (AI) in optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) images, and to analyze the current research status of 
      AI in OCT, and discuss the future research trend. METHODS: On June 1, 2023, a 
      bibliometric analysis of the Web of Science Core Collection was performed in 
      order to explore the utilization of AI in OCT imagery. Key parameters such as 
      papers, countries/regions, citations, databases, organizations, keywords, journal 
      names, and research hotspots were extracted and then visualized employing the 
      VOSviewer and CiteSpace V bibliometric platforms. RESULTS: Fifty-five nations 
      reported studies on AI biotechnology and its application in analyzing OCT images. 
      The United States was the country with the largest number of published papers. 
      Furthermore, 197 institutions worldwide provided published articles, where 
      University of London had more publications than the rest. The reference clusters 
      from the study could be divided into four categories: thickness and eyes, 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), images and segmentation, and OCT classification. 
      CONCLUSION: The latest hot topics and future directions in this field are 
      identified, and the dynamic evolution of AI-based OCT imaging are outlined. 
      AI-based OCT imaging holds great potential for revolutionizing clinical care.

TI  - OCT-based deep learning algorithm for the evaluation of treatment indication with 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medications.

AB  - PURPOSE: Intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (anti-VEGF) medications have become the standard of care for their respective 
      indications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the central retina 
      provide detailed anatomical data and are widely used by clinicians in the 
      decision-making process of anti-VEGF indication. In recent years, significant 
      progress has been made in artificial intelligence and computer vision research. 
      We trained a deep convolutional artificial neural network to predict treatment 
      indication based on central retinal OCT scans without human intervention. METHOD: 
      A total of 183,402 retinal OCT B-scans acquired between 2008 and 2016 were 
      exported from the institutional image archive of a university hospital. OCT 
      images were cross-referenced with the electronic institutional intravitreal 
      injection records. OCT images with a following intravitreal injection during the 
      first 21 days after image acquisition were assigned into the 'injection' group, 
      while the same amount of random OCT images without intravitreal injections was 
      labeled as 'no injection'. After image preprocessing, OCT images were split in a 
      9:1 ratio to training and test datasets. We trained a GoogLeNet inception deep 
      convolutional neural network and assessed its performance on the validation 
      dataset. We calculated prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and 
      receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: The deep convolutional neural 
      network was successfully trained on the extracted clinical data. The trained 
      neural network classifier reached a prediction accuracy of 95.5% on the images in 
      the validation dataset. For single retinal B-scans in the validation dataset, a 
      sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 96.2% were achieved. The area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.968 on a per B-scan image basis, 
      and 0.988 by averaging over six B-scans per examination on the validation 
      dataset. CONCLUSION: Deep artificial neural networks show impressive performance 
      on classification of retinal OCT scans. After training on historical clinical 
      data, machine learning methods can offer the clinician support in the 
      decision-making process. Care should be taken not to mistake neural network 
      output as treatment recommendation and to ensure a final thorough evaluation by 
      the treating physician.

AB  - The incidence of vision impairment is rapidly increasing. Diagnosis and 
      classifying retinal abnormalities in ophthalmological applications is a 
      significant challenge. Using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), the study aims 
      to develop a computer aided diagnosis system for detecting and classifying 
      retinal disorders. Choroidal neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, drusen, 
      and normal cases are the investigated groups. Both deep learning and machine 
      learning are combined to build the system. The SqueezeNet neural network was 
      modified to extract features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest 
      Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT), and Ensemble Model (EM) algorithms were used 
      for disorder classification. The Bayesian optimization technique was also used to 
      determine the best hyperparameters for each model. The model' performance was 
      evaluated through nine criteria using 12,000 OCT images. The results have 
      demonstrated accuracies of 97.39, 97.47, 96.98, and 95.25% for the SVM, K-NN, DT, 
      and EM, respectively. When results are compared to relevant studies in terms of 
      accuracy and tested samples, they show superior performance. As a result, a novel 
      computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting and classifying retinal diseases 
      has been developed, reducing human error while also saving time.

AB  - Retinopathy screening is a non-invasive method to collect retinal images and 
      neovascularization detection from retinal images plays a significant role on the 
      identification and classification of diabetes retinopathy. In this paper, an 
      efficient deep learning network for automatic detection of neovascularization in 
      color fundus images is proposed. The network employs Feature Pyramid Network and 
      Vovnet as the backbone to detect neovascularization. The network is evaluated 
      with color fundus images from practice. Experimental results show the network has 
      less training and test time than Mask R-CNN while with a high accuracy of 98.6%.

      learning.
PG  - 101660

AB  - In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these 
      datasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent 
      pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the 
      adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that 
      ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior ischemic optic 
      neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires too many examples 
      of these conditions. However, this limitation can be addressed with few-shot 
      learning, a machine learning paradigm where a classifier has to generalize to a 
      new category not seen in training, given only a few examples of this category. 
      This paper presents a new few-shot learning framework that extends convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs), trained for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised 
      probabilistic model for rare condition detection. It is based on the observation 
      that CNNs often perceive photographs containing the same anomalies as similar, 
      even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This 
      observation was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to 
      incorporate in our probabilistic model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 
      screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network show that 37 
      conditions, out of 41, can be detected with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) 
      greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular, this framework 
      significantly outperforms other frameworks for detecting rare conditions, 
      including multitask learning, transfer learning and Siamese networks, another 
      few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer predictions to trigger the 
      adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which will revolutionize clinical 
      practice in ophthalmology.

      for retinal microaneurysm detection.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1007/s10792-024-02982-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The timely diagnosis of medical conditions, particularly diabetic 
      retinopathy, relies on the identification of retinal microaneurysms. However, the 
      commonly used retinography method poses a challenge due to the diminutive 
      dimensions and limited differentiation of microaneurysms in images. PROBLEM 
      STATEMENT: Automated identification of microaneurysms becomes crucial, 
      necessitating the use of comprehensive ad-hoc processing techniques. Although 
      fluorescein angiography enhances detectability, its invasiveness limits its 
      suitability for routine preventative screening. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a 
      novel approach for detecting retinal microaneurysms using a fundus scan, 
      leveraging circular reference-based shape features (CR-SF) and radial 
      gradient-based texture features (RG-TF). METHODOLOGY: The proposed technique 
      involves extracting CR-SF and RG-TF for each candidate microaneurysm, employing a 
      robust back-propagation machine learning method for training. During testing, 
      extracted features from test images are compared with training features to 
      categorize microaneurysm presence. RESULTS: The experimental assessment utilized 
      four datasets (MESSIDOR, Diaretdb1, e-ophtha-MA, and ROC), employing various 
      measures. The proposed approach demonstrated high accuracy (98.01%), sensitivity 
      (98.74%), specificity (97.12%), and area under the curve (91.72%). CONCLUSION: 
      The presented approach showcases a successful method for detecting retinal 
      microaneurysms using a fundus scan, providing promising accuracy and sensitivity. 
      This non-invasive technique holds potential for effective screening in diabetic 
      retinopathy and other related medical conditions.

LID - 10.1002/jbio.202200370 [doi]
AB  - A deep learning model called choroidal vascularity index (CVI)-Net is proposed to 
      automatically segment the choroid layer and its vessels in overall optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Clinical parameters are then automatically 
      quantified to determine structural and vascular changes in the choroid with the 
      progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity. The study includes 65 eyes 
      consisting of 34 with proliferative DR (PDR), 17 with nonproliferative DR (NPDR), 
      and 14 healthy controls from two OCT systems. On a dataset of 396 OCT B-scan 
      images with manually annotated ground truths, overall Dice coefficients of 
      96.6 ± 1.5 and 89.1 ± 3.1 are obtained by CVI-Net for the choroid layer and 
      vessel segmentation, respectively. The mean CVI values among the normal, NPDR, 
      and PDR groups are consistent with reported outcomes. Statistical results 
      indicate that CVI shows a significant negative correlation with DR severity 
      level, and this correlation is independent of changes in other physiological 
      parameters.

AB  - AIMS: Machine learning models can use image and text data to predict the number 
      of years since diabetes diagnosis; such model can be applied to new patients to 
      predict, approximately, how long the new patient may have lived with diabetes 
      unknowingly. We aimed to develop a model to predict self-reported diabetes 
      duration. METHODS: We used the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset. 
      Unit of analysis was the fundus image and its meta-data, regardless of the 
      patient. We included people 40 + years and fundus images without diabetic 
      retinopathy. Fundus images and meta-data (sex, age, comorbidities and taking 
      insulin) were passed to the MedCLIP model to extract the embedding 
      representation. The embedding representation was passed to an Extra Tree 
      Classifier to predict: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 and 15 + years with self-reported 
      diabetes. RESULTS: There were 988 images from 563 people (mean age = 67 years; 
      64 % were women). Overall, the F1 score was 57 %. The group 15 + years of 
      self-reported diabetes had the highest precision (64 %) and F1 score (63 %), 
      while the highest recall (69 %) was observed in the group 0-4 years. The 
      proportion of correctly classified observations was 55 % for the group 0-4 years, 
      51 % for 5-9 years, 58 % for 10-14 years, and 64 % for 15 + years with 
      self-reported diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model had acceptable 
      accuracy and F1 score, and correctly classified more than half of the patients 
      according to diabetes duration. Using large foundational models to extract image 
      and text embeddings seems a feasible and efficient approach to predict years 
      living with self-reported diabetes.

TI  - Ocular biomarkers: useful incidental findings by deep learning algorithms in 
      fundus photographs.
LID - 10.1038/s41433-024-03085-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence can assist with ocular image 
      analysis for screening and diagnosis, but it is not yet capable of autonomous 
      full-spectrum screening. Hypothetically, false-positive results may have 
      unrealized screening potential arising from signals persisting despite training 
      and/or ambiguous signals such as from biomarker overlap or high comorbidity. The 
      study aimed to explore the potential to detect clinically useful incidental 
      ocular biomarkers by screening fundus photographs of hypertensive adults using 
      diabetic deep learning algorithms. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Patients referred for 
      treatment-resistant hypertension were imaged at a hospital unit in Perth, 
      Australia, between 2016 and 2022. The same 45° colour fundus photograph selected 
      for each of the 433 participants imaged was processed by three deep learning 
      algorithms. Two expert retinal specialists graded all false-positive results for 
      diabetic retinopathy in non-diabetic participants. RESULTS: Of the 29 
      non-diabetic participants misclassified as positive for diabetic retinopathy, 28 
      (97%) had clinically useful retinal biomarkers. The models designed to screen for 
      fewer diseases captured more incidental disease. All three algorithms showed a 
      positive correlation between severity of hypertensive retinopathy and 
      misclassified diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 
      diabetic deep learning models may be responsive to hypertensive and other 
      clinically useful retinal biomarkers within an at-risk, hypertensive cohort. 
      Observing that models trained for fewer diseases captured more incidental 
      pathology increases confidence in signalling hypotheses aligned with using 
      self-supervised learning to develop autonomous comprehensive screening. 
      Meanwhile, non-referable and false-positive outputs of other deep learning 
      screening models could be explored for immediate clinical use in other 
      populations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), with its subdivisions (machine and deep learning), 
      is a new branch of computer science that has shown impressive results across a 
      variety of domains. The applications of AI to medicine and biology are being 
      widely investigated. Medical specialties that rely heavily on images, including 
      radiology, dermatology, oncology and ophthalmology, were the first to explore AI 
      approaches in analysis and diagnosis. Applications of AI in ophthalmology have 
      concentrated on diseases with high prevalence, such as diabetic retinopathy, 
      retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. 
      Here we provide an overview of AI applications for diagnosis, classification, and 
      clinical management of AMD and other macular dystrophies.

AB  - Retinal fundus images are widely used in diagnosing and providing treatment for 
      several eye diseases. Prior works using retinal fundus images detected the 
      presence of exudation with the aid of publicly available dataset using extensive 
      segmentation process. Though it was proved to be computationally efficient, it 
      failed to create a diabetic retinopathy feature selection system for 
      transparently diagnosing the disease state. Also the diagnosis of diseases did 
      not employ machine learning methods to categorize candidate fundus images into 
      true positive and true negative ratio. Several candidate fundus images did not 
      include more detailed feature selection technique for diabetic retinopathy. To 
      apply machine learning methods and classify the candidate fundus images on the 
      basis of sliding window a method called, Diabetic Fundus Image Recuperation 
      (DFIR) is designed in this paper. The initial phase of DFIR method select the 
      feature of optic cup in digital retinal fundus images based on Sliding Window 
      Approach. With this, the disease state for diabetic retinopathy is assessed. The 
      feature selection in DFIR method uses collection of sliding windows to obtain the 
      features based on the histogram value. The histogram based feature selection with 
      the aid of Group Sparsity Non-overlapping function provides more detailed 
      information of features. Using Support Vector Model in the second phase, the DFIR 
      method based on Spiral Basis Function effectively ranks the diabetic retinopathy 
      diseases. The ranking of disease level for each candidate set provides a much 
      promising result for developing practically automated diabetic retinopathy 
      diagnosis system. Experimental work on digital fundus images using the DFIR 
      method performs research on the factors such as sensitivity, specificity rate, 
      ranking efficiency and feature selection time.

TI  - A generative adversarial neural network with multi-attention feature extraction 
      for fundus lesion segmentation.
PG  - 5079-5090
LID - 10.1007/s10792-023-02911-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fundus lesion segmentation determines the location and size of diabetes 
      retinopathy in fundus image, which assists doctors in developing the best eye 
      treatment plan. However, owing to the scattered distribution and the similarity 
      of lesions, it is extremely difficult to extract representative lesions feature 
      and accurately segment lesions area. METHODS: To solve the thorny problem, a 
      generative adversarial network with multi-attention feature extraction is 
      developed to segment diabetic retinopathy region. The main contributions are as 
      follows: (1) An improved residual U-Net network combining with self-attention 
      mechanism is designed as generative network to fully extract local and global 
      feature of lesions while reducing the loss of key feature information. 
      Considering the correlation between the same lesions feature of different 
      samples, external attention mechanism is introduced in the residual U-Net network 
      to focus on the relevant features of the same lesions in different samples 
      throughout the entire dataset. (2) A discriminative network based on the PatchGAN 
      structure is designed to further enhance the segmentation ability of generation 
      network by discriminating between true and false samples. RESULTS: The proposed 
      network is evaluated on the public dataset IDRiD, which achieved the Dice 
      correlation coefficients of 75.7%, 76.53%, 50.06%, and 45.89% for EX, SE, MA, and 
      HE, respectively. CONCLUSION: The experimental results show the generative 
      adversarial neural network qualified for accurate segmentation of diabetic 
      retinopathy from fundus image well.

TI  - A super-resolution method-based pipeline for fundus fluorescein angiography 
      imaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) imaging is a standard diagnostic 
      tool for many retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and 
      diabetic retinopathy. High-resolution FFA images facilitate the detection of 
      small lesions such as microaneurysms, and other landmark changes, in the early 
      stages; this can help an ophthalmologist improve a patient's cure rate. However, 
      only low-resolution images are available in most clinical cases. Super-resolution 
      (SR), which is a method to improve the resolution of an image, has been 
      successfully employed for natural and remote sensing images. To the best of our 
      knowledge, no one has applied SR techniques to FFA imaging so far. METHODS: In 
      this work, we propose a SR method-based pipeline for FFA imaging. The aim of this 
      pipeline is to enhance the image quality of FFA by using SR techniques. Several 
      SR frameworks including neighborhood embedding, sparsity-based, locally-linear 
      regression and deep learning-based approaches are investigated. Based on a 
      clinical FFA dataset collected from Second Affiliated Hospital to Xuzhou Medical 
      University, each SR method is implemented and evaluated for the pipeline to 
      improve the resolution of FFA images. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As shown in our 
      results, most SR algorithms have a positive impact on the enhancement of FFA 
      images. Super-resolution forests (SRF), a random forest-based SR method has 
      displayed remarkable high effectiveness and outperformed other methods. Hence, 
      SRF should be one potential way to benefit ophthalmologists by obtaining 
      high-resolution FFA images in a clinical setting.

TI  - Automated Quality Assessment of Colour Fundus Images for Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Screening in Telemedicine.
PG  - 869-878
LID - 10.1007/s10278-018-0084-9 [doi]
AB  - Fundus images obtained in a telemedicine program are acquired at different sites 
      that are captured by people who have varying levels of experience. These result 
      in a relatively high percentage of images which are later marked as unreadable by 
      graders. Unreadable images require a recapture which is time and cost intensive. 
      An automated method that determines the image quality during acquisition is an 
      effective alternative. To determine the image quality during acquisition, we 
      describe here an automated method for the assessment of image quality in the 
      context of diabetic retinopathy. The method explicitly applies machine learning 
      techniques to access the image and to determine 'accept' and 'reject' categories. 
      'Reject' category image requires a recapture. A deep convolution neural network 
      is trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 
      colour fundus images was used for the experiment which was obtained from the 
      EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three 
      retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorise these images into 
      'accept' and 'reject' classes based on the precise definition of image quality in 
      the context of DR. The network was trained using 3428 images. The method shows an 
      accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise 'accept' and 'reject' images, which 
      is about 2% higher than the traditional machine learning method. On a clinical 
      trial, the proposed method shows 97% agreement with human grader. The method can 
      be easily incorporated with the fundus image capturing system in the acquisition 
      centre and can guide the photographer whether a recapture is necessary or not.

LID - 10.2337/dc18-0148 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy in a real-world primary care 
      setting of a deep learning-enhanced device for automated detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retinal images of people with type 
      2 diabetes visiting a primary care screening program were graded by a hybrid deep 
      learning-enhanced device (IDx-DR-EU-2.1; IDx, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and 
      its classification of retinopathy (vision-threatening [vt]DR, more than mild 
      [mtm]DR, and mild or more [mom]DR) was compared with a reference standard. This 
      reference standard consisted of grading according to the International Clinical 
      Classification of DR by the Rotterdam Study reading center. We determined the 
      diagnostic accuracy of the hybrid deep learning-enhanced device (IDx-DR-EU-2.1) 
      against the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 1,616 people with type 2 
      diabetes were imaged. The hybrid deep learning-enhanced device's 
      sensitivity/specificity against the reference standard was, respectively, for 
      vtDR 100% (95% CI 77.1-100)/97.8% (95% CI 96.8-98.5) and for mtmDR 79.4% (95% CI 
      66.5-87.9)/93.8% (95% CI 92.1-94.9). CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid deep 
      learning-enhanced device had high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of both 
      vtDR (although the number of vtDR cases was low) and mtmDR in a primary care 
      setting against an independent reading center. This allows its' safe use in a 
      primary care setting.

TI  - Development and Clinical Validation of Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial 
      Networks for Detection of Retinal Disorders in Optical Coherence Tomography 
      Images Using Small Dataset.
PG  - 219-226
LID - 10.1097/APO.0000000000000498 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and test semi-supervised generative adversarial networks 
      (GANs) that detect retinal disorders on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images 
      using a small-labeled dataset. METHODS: From a public database, we randomly chose 
      a small supervised dataset with 400 OCT images (100 choroidal neovascularization, 
      100 diabetic macular edema, 100 drusen, and 100 normal) and assigned all other 
      OCT images to unsupervised dataset (107,912 images without labeling). We adopted 
      a semi-supervised GAN and a supervised deep learning (DL) model for automatically 
      detecting retinal disorders from OCT images. The performance of the 2 models was 
      compared in 3 testing datasets with different OCT devices. The evaluation metrics 
      included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The local validation dataset included 
      1000 images with 250 from each category. The independent clinical dataset 
      included 366 OCT images using Cirrus OCT Shanghai Shibei Hospital and 511 OCT 
      images using RTVue OCT from Xinhua Hospital respectively. The semi-supervised 
      GANs classifier achieved better accuracy than supervised DL model (0.91 vs 0.86 
      for local cell validation dataset, 0.91 vs 0.86 in the Shanghai Shibei Hospital 
      testing dataset, and 0.93 vs 0.92 in Xinhua Hospital testing dataset). For 
      detecting urgent referrals (choroidal neo-vascularization and diabetic macular 
      edema) from nonurgent referrals (drusen and normal) on OCT images, the 
      semi-supervised GANs classifier also achieved better area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curves than supervised DL model (0.99 vs 0.97, 0.97 vs 
      0.96, and 0.99 vs 0.99, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A semi-supervised GAN can 
      achieve better performance than that of a supervised DL model when the labeled 
      dataset is limited. The current study offers utility to various research and 
      clinical studies using DL with relatively small datasets. Semi-supervised GANs 
      can detect retinal disorders from OCT images using relatively small dataset.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence framework for 
      identifying multiple retinal lesions at image level and performing an explainable 
      macular disease diagnosis at eye level in optical coherence tomography images. 
      METHODS: A total of 26,815 optical coherence tomography images were collected 
      from 865 eyes, and 9 retinal lesions and 3 macular diseases were labeled by 
      ophthalmologists, including diabetic macular edema and dry/wet age-related 
      macular degeneration. We applied deep learning to classify retinal lesions at 
      image level and random forests to achieve an explainable disease diagnosis at eye 
      level. The performance of the integrated two-stage framework was evaluated and 
      compared with human experts. RESULTS: On testing data set of 2,480 optical 
      coherence tomography images from 80 eyes, the deep learning model achieved an 
      average area under curve of 0.978 (95% confidence interval, 0.971-0.983) for 
      lesion classification. In addition, random forests performed accurate disease 
      diagnosis with a 0% error rate, which achieved the same accuracy as one of the 
      human experts and was better than the other three experts. It also revealed that 
      the detection of specific lesions in the center of macular region had more 
      contribution to macular disease diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The integrated method 
      achieved high accuracy and interpretability in retinal lesion classification and 
      macular disease diagnosis in optical coherence tomography images and could have 
      the potential to facilitate the clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) refers to the ophthalmological complications of 
      diabetes mellitus. It is primarily a disease of the retinal vasculature that can 
      lead to vision loss. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) demonstrates 
      the ability to detect the changes in the retinal vascular system, which can help 
      in the early detection of DR. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that 
      can detect DR from OCTA based on capturing the appearance and morphological 
      markers of the retinal vascular system. This new framework consists of the 
      following main steps: (1) extracting retinal vascular system from OCTA images 
      based on using joint Markov-Gibbs Random Field (MGRF) model to model the 
      appearance of OCTA images and (2) estimating the distance map inside the 
      extracted vascular system to be used as imaging markers that describe the 
      morphology of the retinal vascular (RV) system. The OCTA images, extracted 
      vascular system, and the RV-estimated distance map is then composed into a 
      three-dimensional matrix to be used as an input to a convolutional neural network 
      (CNN). The main motivation for using this data representation is that it combines 
      the low-level data as well as high-level processed data to allow the CNN to 
      capture significant features to increase its ability to distinguish DR from the 
      normal retina. This has been applied on multi-scale levels to include the 
      original full dimension images as well as sub-images extracted from the original 
      OCTA images. The proposed approach was tested on in-vivo data using about 91 
      patients, which were qualitatively graded by retinal experts. In addition, it was 
      quantitatively validated using datasets based on three metrics: sensitivity, 
      specificity, and overall accuracy. Results showed the capability of the proposed 
      approach, outperforming the current deep learning as well as features-based 
      detecting DR approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) 
      is a volumetric imaging technique that allows measuring patterns between layers 
      such as small amounts of fluid. Since 2012, automatic medical image analysis 
      performance has steadily increased through the use of deep learning models that 
      automatically learn relevant features for specific tasks, instead of designing 
      visual features manually. Nevertheless, providing insights and interpretation of 
      the predictions made by the model is still a challenge. This paper describes a 
      deep learning model able to detect medically interpretable information in 
      relevant images from a volume to classify diabetes-related retinal diseases. 
      METHODS: This article presents a new deep learning model, OCT-NET, which is a 
      customized convolutional neural network for processing scans extracted from 
      optical coherence tomography volumes. OCT-NET is applied to the classification of 
      three conditions seen in SD-OCT volumes. Additionally, the proposed model 
      includes a feedback stage that highlights the areas of the scans to support the 
      interpretation of the results. This information is potentially useful for a 
      medical specialist while assessing the prediction produced by the model. RESULTS: 
      The proposed model was tested on the public SERI-CUHK and A2A SD-OCT data sets 
      containing healthy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and age-related 
      macular degeneration. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method 
      outperforms conventional convolutional deep learning models from the state of the 
      art reported on the SERI+CUHK and A2A SD-OCT data sets with a precision of 93% 
      and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed method is able to classify the three studied retinal diseases with high 
      accuracy. One advantage of the method is its ability to produce interpretable 
      clinical information in the form of highlighting the regions of the image that 
      most contribute to the classifier decision.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic complication, which usually 
      leads to retinal damage, vision loss, and even blindness. A computer-aided DR 
      grading system has a significant impact on helping ophthalmologists with rapid 
      screening and diagnosis. Recent advances in fundus photography have precipitated 
      the development of novel retinal imaging cameras and their subsequent 
      implementation in clinical practice. However, most deep learning-based algorithms 
      for DR grading demonstrate limited generalization across domains. This inferior 
      performance stems from variance in imaging protocols and devices inducing domain 
      shifts. We posit that declining model performance between domains arises from 
      learning spurious correlations in the data. Incorporating do-operations from 
      causality analysis into model architectures may mitigate this issue and improve 
      generalizability. Specifically, a novel universal structural causal model (SCM) 
      was proposed to analyze spurious correlations in fundus imaging. Building on 
      this, a causality-inspired diabetic retinopathy grading framework named CauDR was 
      developed to eliminate spurious correlations and achieve more generalizable DR 
      diagnostics. Furthermore, existing datasets were reorganized into 4DR benchmark 
      for DG scenario. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art 
      (SOTA) performance of CauDR. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the project was to develop a novel method for diabetic 
      retinopathy screening based on the examination of tear fluid biomarker changes. 
      In order to evaluate the usability of protein biomarkers for pre-screening 
      purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning 
      algorithms. METHODS: All persons involved in the study had diabetes. Diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed by capturing 7-field fundus images, evaluated by 
      two independent ophthalmologists. 165 eyes were examined (from 119 patients), 55 
      were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of DR. Tear samples were taken 
      from all eyes and state-of-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry 
      protein identification was performed on all samples. Applicability of protein 
      biomarkers was evaluated by six different optimally parameterized machine 
      learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Recursive Partitioning, Random 
      Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor. RESULTS: Out of the 
      six investigated machine learning algorithms the result of Recursive Partitioning 
      proved to be the most accurate. The performance of the system realizing the above 
      algorithm reached 74% sensitivity and 48% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Protein 
      biomarkers selected and classified with machine learning algorithms alone are at 
      present not recommended for screening purposes because of low specificity and 
      sensitivity values. This tool can be potentially used to improve the results of 
      image processing methods as a complementary tool in automatic or semiautomatic 
      systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in adults 
      worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) with autonomous deep learning algorithms 
      has been increasingly used in retinal image analysis, particularly for the 
      screening of referrable DR. An established treatment for proliferative DR is 
      panretinal or focal laser photocoagulation. Training autonomous models to discern 
      laser patterns can be important in disease management and follow-up. METHODS: A 
      deep learning model was trained for laser treatment detection using the EyePACs 
      dataset. Data was randomly assigned, by participant, into development (n=18 945) 
      and validation (n=2105) sets. Analysis was conducted at the single image, eye, 
      and patient levels. The model was then used to filter input for three independent 
      AI models for retinal indications; changes in model efficacy were measured using 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and mean absolute 
      error (MAE). RESULTS: On the task of laser photocoagulation detection: AUCs of 
      0.981, 0.95, and 0.979 were achieved at the patient, image, and eye levels, 
      respectively. When analysing independent models, efficacy was shown to improve 
      across the board after filtering. Diabetic macular oedema detection on images 
      with artefacts was AUC 0.932 vs AUC 0.955 on those without. Participant sex 
      detection on images with artefacts was AUC 0.872 vs AUC 0.922 on those without. 
      Participant age detection on images with artefacts was MAE 5.33 vs MAE 3.81 on 
      those without. CONCLUSION: The proposed model for laser treatment detection 
      achieved high performance on all analysis metrics and has been demonstrated to 
      positively affect the efficacy of different AI models, suggesting that laser 
      detection can generally improve AI-powered applications for fundus images.

AB  - Vision loss caused by diabetic macular edema (DME) can be prevented by early 
      detection and laser photocoagulation. As there is no comprehensive detection 
      technique to recognize NPA, we proposed an automatic detection method of NPA on 
      fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) in DME. The study included 3,014 FFA images 
      of 221 patients with DME. We use 3 convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
      including DenseNet, ResNet50, and VGG16, to identify non-perfusion regions (NP), 
      microaneurysms, and leakages in FFA images. The NPA was segmented using attention 
      U-net. To validate its performance, we applied our detection algorithm on 249 FFA 
      images in which the NPA areas were manually delineated by 3 ophthalmologists. For 
      DR lesion classification, area under the curve is 0.8855 for NP regions, 0.9782 
      for microaneurysms, and 0.9765 for leakage classifier. The average precision of 
      NP region overlap ratio is 0.643. NP regions of DME in FFA images are identified 
      based a new automated deep learning algorithm. This study is an in-depth study 
      from computer-aided diagnosis to treatment, and will be the theoretical basis for 
      the application of intelligent guided laser.

AB  - Retinal fundus diseases can lead to irreversible visual impairment without timely 
      diagnoses and appropriate treatments. Single disease-based deep learning 
      algorithms had been developed for the detection of diabetic retinopathy, 
      age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Here, we developed a deep 
      learning platform (DLP) capable of detecting multiple common referable fundus 
      diseases and conditions (39 classes) by using 249,620 fundus images marked with 
      275,543 labels from heterogenous sources. Our DLP achieved a frequency-weighted 
      average F1 score of 0.923, sensitivity of 0.978, specificity of 0.996 and area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9984 for multi-label 
      classification in the primary test dataset and reached the average level of 
      retina specialists. External multihospital test, public data test and 
      tele-reading application also showed high efficiency for multiple retinal 
      diseases and conditions detection. These results indicate that our DLP can be 
      applied for retinal fundus disease triage, especially in remote areas around the 
      world.

      Artificial intelligence automated systems can be used for diabetic eye screening 
      but are not employed in the national English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. 
      The aim was to report the performance of a commercially available deep-learning 
      artificial intelligence software in a large English population. METHODS: 9817 
      anonymised image sets from 10,000 consecutive diabetic eye screening episodes 
      were presented to an artificial intelligence software. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of the artificial intelligence system for detecting diabetic 
      retinopathy were determined using the diabetic eye screening programme manual 
      grade according to national protocols as the reference standard. RESULTS: For no 
      diabetic retinopathy versus any diabetic retinopathy, the sensitivity of the 
      artificial intelligence grading system was 69.7% and specificity 92.2%. The 
      performance of the artificial intelligence system was superior for no or mild 
      diabetic retinopathy versus significant or referrable diabetic retinopathy with a 
      sensitivity of 95.4% and specificity of 92.0%. No cases were identified in which 
      the artificial intelligence grade had missed significant diabetic retinopathy. 
      CONCLUSION: The performance of a commercially available deep-learning artificial 
      intelligence system for identifying diabetic retinopathy in an English national 
      Diabetic Eye Screening Programme is presented. Using the pre-defined settings 
      artificial intelligence performance was highest when identifying diabetic 
      retinopathy which requires an action by the screening programme.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of computer vision and image 
      processing. In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown 
      to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. 
      However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without 
      methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a 
      physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more 
      experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian 
      uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus 
      images and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward 
      alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral 
      can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks 
      and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and 
      task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as 
      recommended by the NHS when referring 0-20% of the most uncertain decisions for 
      further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 
      2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space. While uncertainty is 
      sensitive to clinically relevant cases, sensitivity to unfamiliar data samples is 
      task dependent, but can be rendered more robust.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of 
      blindness worldwide, and therefore its early detection is important in order to 
      reduce disease-related eye injuries. DR is diagnosed by inspecting fundus images. 
      Since microaneurysms (MA) are one of the main symptoms of the disease, 
      distinguishing this complication within the fundus images facilitates early DR 
      detection. In this paper, an automatic analysis of retinal images using 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented. METHODS: Our method incorporates 
      a novel technique utilizing a two-stage process with two online datasets which 
      results in accurate detection while solving the imbalance data problem and 
      decreasing training time in comparison with previous studies. We have implemented 
      our proposed CNNs using the Keras library. RESULTS: In order to evaluate our 
      proposed method, an experiment was conducted on two standard publicly available 
      datasets, i.e., Retinopathy Online Challenge dataset and E-Ophtha-MA dataset. Our 
      results demonstrated a promising sensitivity value of about 0.8 for an average of 
      >6 false positives per image, which is competitive with state of the art 
      approaches. CONCLUSION: Our method indicates significant improvement in 
      MA-detection using retinal fundus images for monitoring diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Two Eyes Are Better Than One: Exploiting Binocular Correlation for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Severity Grading.
PG  - 2115-2118
LID - 10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630812 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common eye conditions among diabetic 
      patients. However, vision loss occurs primarily in the late stages of DR, and the 
      symptoms of visual impairment, ranging from mild to severe, can vary greatly, 
      adding to the burden of diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice. Deep 
      learning methods based on retinal images have achieved remarkable success in 
      automatic DR grading, but most of them neglect that the presence of diabetes 
      usually affects both eyes, and ophthalmologists usually compare both eyes 
      concurrently for DR diagnosis, leaving correlations between left and right eyes 
      unexploited. In this study, simulating the diagnostic process, we propose a 
      two-stream binocular network to capture the subtle correlations between left and 
      right eyes, in which, paired images of eyes are fed into two identical 
      subnetworks separately during training. We design a contrastive grading loss to 
      learn binocular correlation for five-class DR detection, which maximizes 
      inter-class dissimilarity while minimizing the intra-class difference. 
      Experimental results on the EyePACS dataset show the superiority of the proposed 
      binocular model, outperforming monocular methods by a large margin.Clinical 
      relevance- Compared to conventional DR grading methods based on monocular images, 
      our approach can provide more accurate predictions and extract graphical patterns 
      from retinal images of both eyes for clinical reference.

TI  - Image quality classification for DR screening using deep learning.
PG  - 664-667
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036912 [doi]
AB  - The quality of input images significantly affects the outcome of automated 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening systems. Unlike the previous methods that 
      only consider simple low-level features such as hand-crafted geometric and 
      structural features, in this paper we propose a novel method for retinal image 
      quality classification (IQC) that performs computational algorithms imitating the 
      working of the human visual system. The proposed algorithm combines unsupervised 
      features from saliency map and supervised features coming from convolutional 
      neural networks (CNN), which are fed to an SVM to automatically detect high 
      quality vs poor quality retinal fundus images. We demonstrate the superior 
      performance of our proposed algorithm on a large retinal fundus image dataset and 
      the method could achieve higher accuracy than other methods. Although retinal 
      images are used in this study, the methodology is applicable to the image quality 
      assessment and enhancement of other types of medical images.

LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2024.02.019 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, advancements in retinal image analysis, driven by machine 
      learning and deep learning techniques, have enhanced disease detection and 
      diagnosis through automated feature extraction. However, challenges persist, 
      including limited data set diversity due to privacy concerns and imbalanced 
      sample pairs, hindering effective model training. To address these issues, we 
      introduce the vessel and style guided generative adversarial network (VSG-GAN), 
      an innovative algorithm building upon the foundational concept of GAN. In 
      VSG-GAN, a generator and discriminator engage in an adversarial process to 
      produce realistic retinal images. Our approach decouples retinal image generation 
      into distinct modules: the vascular skeleton and background style. Leveraging 
      style transformation and GAN inversion, our proposed hierarchical variational 
      autoencoder module generates retinal images with diverse morphological traits. In 
      addition, the spatially adaptive denormalization module ensures consistency 
      between input and generated images. We evaluate our model on MESSIDOR and RITE 
      data sets using various metrics, including structural similarity index measure, 
      inception score, Fréchet inception distance, and kernel inception distance. Our 
      results demonstrate the superiority of VSG-GAN, outperforming existing methods 
      across all evaluation assessments. This underscores its effectiveness in 
      addressing data set limitations and imbalances. Our algorithm provides a novel 
      solution to challenges in retinal image analysis by offering diverse and 
      realistic retinal image generation. Implementing the VSG-GAN augmentation 
      approach on downstream diabetic retinopathy classification tasks has shown 
      enhanced disease diagnosis accuracy, further advancing the utility of machine 
      learning in this domain.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading disabling 
      chronic diseases and one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in 
      developed world. Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy enables timely treatment 
      and in order to achieve it a major effort will have to be invested into automated 
      population screening programs. Detection of exudates in color fundus photographs 
      is very important for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: We use 
      deep convolutional neural networks for exudate detection. In order to incorporate 
      high level anatomical knowledge about potential exudate locations, output of the 
      convolutional neural network is combined with the output of the optic disc 
      detection and vessel detection procedures. RESULTS: In the validation step using 
      a manually segmented image database we obtain a maximum F(1) measure of 0.78. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As manually segmenting and counting exudate areas is a tedious task, 
      having a reliable automated output, such as automated segmentation using 
      convolutional neural networks in combination with other landmark detectors, is an 
      important step in creating automated screening programs for early detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Classification of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images can be 
      achieved with high accuracy using classical convolution neural networks (CNN), a 
      commonly used deep learning network for computer-aided diagnosis. Classical CNN 
      has often been criticized for suppressing positional relations in a pooling 
      layer. Therefore, because capsule networks can learn positional information from 
      images, we attempted application of a capsule network to OCT images to overcome 
      that shortcoming. This study is our attempt to improve classification accuracy by 
      replacing CNN with a capsule network. METHODS: From an OCT dataset, we produced a 
      training dataset of 83,484 images and a test dataset of 1000 images. For 
      training, the dataset comprises 37,205 images with choroidal neovascularization 
      (CNV), 11,348 with diabetic macular edema (DME), 8616 with drusen, and 26,315 
      normal images. The test dataset has 250 images from each category. The proposed 
      model was constructed based on a capsule network for improving classification 
      accuracy. It was trained using the training dataset. Subsequently, the test 
      dataset was used to evaluate the trained model. RESULTS: Classification of OCT 
      images using our method achieved accuracy of 99.6%, which is 3.2 percentage 
      points higher than that of other methods described in the literature. CONCLUSION: 
      The proposed method achieved classification accuracy results equivalent to those 
      reported for other methods for CNV, DME, drusen, and normal images.

AB  - PURPOSE: Previous deep learning studies on optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      mainly focused on diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. We 
      proposed a deep learning model that can identify epiretinal membrane (ERM) in OCT 
      with ophthalmologist-level performance. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,618 central fovea cross section OCT images from 1,475 
      eyes of 964 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 7,652 OCT images from 
      1,197 patients. From these images, 2,171 were normal and 1,447 were ERM OCT. A 
      total of 3,141 OCT images was used as training dataset and 477 images as testing 
      dataset. DL algorithm was used to train the interpretation model. Diagnostic 
      results by four board-certified non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists on the 
      testing dataset were compared with those generated by the DL model. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: We calculated for the derived DL model the following characteristics: 
      sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These were calculated according to the gold 
      standard results which were parallel diagnoses of the retinal specialist. 
      Performance of the DL model was finally compared with that of non-retinal 
      specialized ophthalmologists. RESULTS: Regarding the diagnosis of ERM in OCT 
      images, the trained DL model had the following characteristics in performance: 
      sensitivity: 98.7%, specificity: 98.0%, and F1 score: 0.945. The accuracy on the 
      training dataset was 99.7% (95% CI: 99.4 - 99.9%), and for the testing dataset, 
      diagnostic accuracy was 98.1% (95% CI: 96.5 - 99.1%). AUC of the ROC curve was 
      0.999. The DL model slightly outperformed the average non-retinal specialized 
      ophthalmologists. CONCLUSIONS: An ophthalmologist-level DL model was built here 
      to accurately identify ERM in OCT images. The performance of the model was 
      slightly better than the average non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. The 
      derived model may play a role to assist clinicians to promote the efficiency and 
      safety of healthcare in the future.

AB  - Microaneurysms (MAs) are pathognomonic signs that help clinicians to detect 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the early stages. Automatic detection of MA in 
      retinal images is an active area of research due to its application in screening 
      processes for DR which is one of the main reasons of blindness amongst the 
      working-age population. The focus of these works is on the automatic detection of 
      MAs in en face retinal images like fundus color and Fluorescein Angiography (FA). 
      On the other hand, detection of MAs from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
      images has 2 main advantages: first, OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that 
      does not require injection, therefore is safer. Secondly, because of the proven 
      application of OCT in detection of Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Diabetic 
      Macular Edema, and normal cases, thanks to detecting MAs in OCT, extensive 
      information is obtained by using this imaging technique. In this research, the 
      concentration is on the diagnosis of MAs using deep learning in the OCT images 
      which represent in-depth structure of retinal layers. To this end, OCT B-scans 
      should be divided into strips and MA patterns should be searched in the resulted 
      strips. Since we need a dataset comprising OCT image strips with suitable labels 
      and such large labelled datasets are not yet available, we have created it. For 
      this purpose, an exact registration method is utilized to align OCT images with 
      FA photographs. Then, with the help of corresponding FA images, OCT image strips 
      are created from OCT B-scans in four labels, namely MA, normal, abnormal, and 
      vessel. Once the dataset of image strips is prepared, a stacked generalization 
      (stacking) ensemble of four fine-tuned, pre-trained convolutional neural networks 
      is trained to classify the strips of OCT images into the mentioned classes. FA 
      images are used once to create OCT strips for training process and they are no 
      longer needed for subsequent steps. Once the stacking ensemble model is obtained, 
      it will be used to classify the OCT strips in the test process. The results 
      demonstrate that the proposed framework classifies overall OCT image strips and 
      OCT strips containing MAs with accuracy scores of 0.982 and 0.987, respectively.

AB  - Distribution shifts remain a problem for the safe application of regulated 
      medical AI systems, and may impact their real-world performance if undetected. 
      Postmarket shifts can occur for example if algorithms developed on data from 
      various acquisition settings and a heterogeneous population are predominantly 
      applied in hospitals with lower quality data acquisition or other centre-specific 
      acquisition factors, or where some ethnicities are over-represented. Therefore, 
      distribution shift detection could be important for monitoring AI-based medical 
      products during postmarket surveillance. We implemented and evaluated three 
      deep-learning based shift detection techniques (classifier-based, deep kernel, 
      and multiple univariate kolmogorov-smirnov tests) on simulated shifts in a 
      dataset of 130'486 retinal images. We trained a deep learning classifier for 
      diabetic retinopathy grading. We then simulated population shifts by changing the 
      prevalence of patients' sex, ethnicity, and co-morbidities, and example 
      acquisition shifts by changes in image quality. We observed classification 
      subgroup performance disparities w.r.t. image quality, patient sex, ethnicity and 
      co-morbidity presence. The sensitivity at detecting referable diabetic 
      retinopathy ranged from 0.50 to 0.79 for different ethnicities. This motivates 
      the need for detecting shifts after deployment. Classifier-based tests performed 
      best overall, with perfect detection rates for quality and co-morbidity subgroup 
      shifts at a sample size of 1000. It was the only method to detect shifts in 
      patient sex, but required large sample sizes (  > 30'000 ). All methods 
      identified easier-to-detect out-of-distribution shifts with small (≤300) sample 
      sizes. We conclude that effective tools exist for detecting clinically relevant 
      distribution shifts. In particular classifier-based tests can be easily 
      implemented components in the post-market surveillance strategy of medical device 
      manufacturers.

AB  - In the realm of precision medicine, the potential of deep learning is 
      progressively harnessed to facilitate intricate clinical decision-making, 
      especially when navigating multifaceted datasets encompassing Omics, Clinical, 
      image, device, social, and environmental dimensions. This study accentuates the 
      criticality of image data, given its instrumental role in detecting and 
      classifying vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) - a predominant global 
      contributor to vision impairment. The timely identification of VTDR is a linchpin 
      for efficacious interventions and the mitigation of vision loss. Addressing this, 
      This study introduces "NIMEQ-SACNet," a novel hybrid model by the prowess of the 
      Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (EQI-BGWO) with a 
      self-attention capsule network. The proposed approach is characterized by two 
      pivotal advancements: firstly, the augmentation of the Binary Grey Wolf 
      Optimization through Quantum Computing methodologies, and secondly, the 
      deployment of the enhanced EQI-BGWO to adeptly calibrate the SACNet's parameters, 
      culminating in a notable uplift in VTDR classification accuracy. The proposed 
      model's ability to handle binary, 5-stage, and 7-stage VTDR classifications 
      adroitly is noteworthy. Rigorous assessments on the fundus image dataset, 
      underscored by metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, 
      F1-Score, and MCC, bear testament to NIMEQ-SACNet's pre-eminence over prevailing 
      algorithms and classification frameworks.

AB  - Retinal haemorrhage stands as an early indicator of diabetic retinopathy, 
      necessitating accurate detection for timely diagnosis. Addressing this need, this 
      study proposes an enhanced machine-based diagnostic test for diabetic retinopathy 
      through an updated UNet framework, adept at scrutinizing fundus images for signs 
      of retinal haemorrhages. The customized UNet underwent GPU training using the 
      IDRiD database, validated against the publicly available DIARETDB1 and IDRiD 
      datasets. Emphasizing the complexity of segmentation, the study employed 
      preprocessing techniques, augmenting image quality and data integrity. 
      Subsequently, the trained neural network showcased a remarkable performance 
      boost, accurately identifying haemorrhage regions with 80% sensitivity, 99.6% 
      specificity, and 98.6% accuracy. The experimental findings solidify the network's 
      reliability, showcasing potential to alleviate ophthalmologists' workload 
      significantly. Notably, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 76.61% and 
      a Dice coefficient of 86.51% underscores the system's competence. The study's 
      outcomes signify substantial enhancements in diagnosing critical diabetic retinal 
      conditions, promising profound improvements in diagnostic accuracy and 
      efficiency, thereby marking a significant advancement in automated retinal

TI  - An Artificial Intelligence Driven Approach for Classification of Ophthalmic 
      Images using Convolutional Neural Network: An Experimental Study.
LID - 10.2174/0115734056286918240419100058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early disease detection is emphasized within ophthalmology now more 
      than ever, and as a result, clinicians and innovators turn to deep learning to 
      expedite accurate diagnosis and mitigate treatment delay. Efforts concentrate on 
      the creation of deep learning systems that analyze clinical image data to detect 
      disease-specific features with maximum sensitivity. Moreover, these systems hold 
      promise of early accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients with common 
      progressive diseases. DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG-16 are among a few of the deep 
      learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms that have been introduced 
      and are being investigated for potential application within ophthalmology. 
      METHODS: In this study, the authors sought to create and evaluate a novel 
      ensembled deep learning CNN model that analyzes a dataset of shuffled retinal 
      color fundus images (RCFIs) from eyes with various ocular disease features 
      (cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy). Our aim was to determine (1) the 
      relative performance of our finalized model in classifying RCFIs according to 
      disease and (2) the diagnostic potential of the finalized model to serve as a 
      screening test for specific diseases (cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) 
      upon presentation of RCFIs with diverse disease manifestations. RESULTS: We found 
      adding convolutional layers to an existing VGG-16 model, which was named as a 
      proposed model in this article that, resulted in significantly increased 
      performance with 98% accuracy (p<0.05), including good diagnostic potential for 
      binary disease detection in cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSION: 
      The proposed model was found to be suitable and accurate for a decision support 
      system in Ophthalmology Clinical Framework.

TI  - RD-OCT net: hybrid learning system for automated diagnosis of macular diseases 
      from OCT retinal images.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ad27ea [doi]
AB  - Macular Edema is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in patients 
      with ocular fundus diseases. Due to its non-invasive and high-resolution 
      characteristics, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been extensively utilized 
      for the diagnosis of macular diseases. The manual detection of retinal diseases 
      by clinicians is a laborious process, further complicated by the challenging 
      identification of macular diseases. This difficulty arises from the significant 
      pathological alterations occurring within the retinal layers, as well as the 
      accumulation of fluid in the retina. Deep Learning neural networks are utilized 
      for automatic detection of retinal diseases. This paper aims to propose a 
      lightweight hybrid learning Retinal Disease OCT Net with a reduced number of 
      trainable parameters and enable automatic classification of retinal diseases. A 
      Hybrid Learning Retinal Disease OCT Net (RD-OCT) is utilized for the multiclass 
      classification of major retinal diseases, namely neovascular age-related macular 
      degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), 
      and normal retinal conditions. The diagnosis of retinal diseases is facilitated 
      by the use of hybrid learning models and pre-trained deep learning models in the 
      field of artificial intelligence. The Hybrid Learning RD-OCT Net provides better 
      accuracy of 97.6% for nAMD, 98.08% for DME, 98% for RVO, and 97% for the Normal 
      group. The respective area under the curve values were 0.99, 0.97, 1.0, and 0.99. 
      The utilization of the RD-OCT model will be useful for ophthalmologists in the 
      diagnosis of prevalent retinal diseases, due to the simplicity of the system and 
      reduced number of trainable parameters.

AB  - Automatic grading of retinal blood vessels from fundus image can be a useful tool 
      for diagnosis, planning and treatment of eye. Automatic diagnosis of retinal 
      images for early detection of glaucoma, stroke, and blindness is emerging in 
      intelligent health care system. The method primarily depends on various abnormal 
      signs, such as area of hard exudates, area of blood vessels, bifurcation points, 
      texture, and entropies. The development of an automated screening system based on 
      vessel width, tortuosity, and vessel branching are also used for grading. 
      However, the automated method that directly can come to a decision by taking the 
      fundus images got less attention. Detecting eye problems based on the tortuosity 
      of the vessel from fundus images is a complicated task for opthalmologists. So 
      automated grading algorithm using deep learning can be most valuable for grading 
      retinal health. The aim of this work is to develop an automatic computer aided 
      diagnosis system to solve the problem. This work approaches to achieve an 
      automatic grading method that is opted using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
      model. In this work we have studied the state-of-the-art machine learning 
      algorithms and proposed an attention network which can grade retinal images. The 
      proposed method is validated on a public dataset EIARG1, which is only publicly 
      available dataset for such task as per our knowledge.

TI  - Automatic diagnosis of macular diseases from OCT volume based on its 
      two-dimensional feature map and convolutional neural network with attention 
      mechanism.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Automatic and accurate classification of three-dimensional (3-D) 
      retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is essential for assisting 
      ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and grading of macular diseases. Therefore, more 
      effective OCT volume classification for automatic recognition of macular diseases 
      is needed. AIM: For OCT volumes in which only OCT volume-level labels are known, 
      OCT volume classifiers based on its global feature and deep learning are 
      designed, validated, and compared with other methods. APPROACH: We present a 
      general framework to classify OCT volume for automatic recognizing macular 
      diseases. The architecture of the framework consists of three modules: B-scan 
      feature extractor, two-dimensional (2-D) feature map generation, and volume-level 
      classifier. Our architecture could address OCT volume classification using two 
      2-D image machine learning classification algorithms. Specifically, a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained and used as a B-scan feature 
      extractor to construct a 2-D feature map of an OCT volume and volume-level 
      classifiers such as support vector machine and CNN with/without attention 
      mechanism for 2-D feature maps are described. RESULTS: Our proposed methods are 
      validated on the publicly available Duke dataset, which consists of 269 
      intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) volumes and 115 normal 
      volumes. Fivefold cross-validation was done, and average accuracy, sensitivity, 
      and specificity of 98.17%, 99.26%, and 95.65%, respectively, are achieved. The 
      experiments show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Our 
      methods are also validated on our private clinical OCT volume dataset, consisting 
      of 448 AMD volumes and 462 diabetic macular edema volumes. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      present a general framework of OCT volume classification based on its 2-D feature 
      map and CNN with attention mechanism and describe its implementation schemes. Our 
      proposed methods could classify OCT volumes automatically and effectively with 
      high accuracy, and they are a potential practical tool for screening of 
      ophthalmic diseases from OCT volume.

TI  - Development of "Predict ME," an online classifier to aid in differentiating 
      diabetic macular edema from pseudophakic macular edema.

AB  - PURPOSE: Differentiating the underlying pathology of macular edema in patients 
      with diabetic retinopathy following cataract surgery can be challenging. In 2015, 
      Munk and colleagues trained and tested a machine learning classifier which uses 
      optical coherence tomography variables in order to distinguish the underlying 
      pathology of macular edema between diabetic macular edema and pseudophakic 
      cystoid macular edema. It was able to accurately diagnose the underlying 
      pathology in 90%-96% of cases. However, actually using the trained classifier 
      required dedicated software and advanced technical skills which hindered its 
      accessibility to most clinicians. Our aim was to package the classifier in an 
      easy to use web-tool and validate the web-tool using a new cohort of patients. 
      METHODS: We packaged the classifier in a web-tool intended for use on a personal 
      computer or mobile phone. We first ensured that the results from the web-tool 
      coincide exactly with the results from the original algorithm and then proceeded 
      to test it using data of 14 patients. RESULTS: The etiology was accurately 
      predicted in 12 out of 14 cases (86%). The cases with diabetic macular edema were 
      accurately diagnosed in 7 out of 7 cases. Of the pseudophakic cystoid macular 
      edema cases, 5 out of 6 were correctly interpreted and 1 case with a mixed 
      etiology was interpreted as pseudophakic cystoid macular edema. Variable input 
      was reported to be easy and took on average 7 ± 3 min. CONCLUSION: The web-tool 
      implementation of the classifier seems to be a valuable tool to support research 
      into this field.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), an ocular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause 
      of blindness worldwide. Traditionally, DR is monitored using Color Fundus 
      Photography (CFP), a widespread 2-D imaging modality. However, DR classifications 
      based on CFP have poor predictive power, resulting in suboptimal DR management. 
      Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a recent 3-D imaging modality 
      offering enhanced structural and functional information (blood flow) with a wider 
      field of view. This paper investigates automatic DR severity assessment using 3-D 
      OCTA. A straightforward solution to this task is a 3-D neural network classifier. 
      However, 3-D architectures have numerous parameters and typically require many 
      training samples. A lighter solution consists in using 2-D neural network 
      classifiers processing 2-D en-face (or frontal) projections and/or 2-D 
      cross-sectional slices. Such an approach mimics the way ophthalmologists analyze 
      OCTA acquisitions: (1) en-face flow maps are often used to detect avascular zones 
      and neovascularization, and (2) cross-sectional slices are commonly analyzed to 
      detect macular edemas, for instance. However, arbitrary data reduction or 
      selection might result in information loss. Two complementary strategies are thus 
      proposed to optimally summarize OCTA volumes with 2-D images: (1) a parametric 
      en-face projection optimized through deep learning and (2) a cross-sectional 
      slice selection process controlled through gradient-based attribution. The full 
      summarization and DR classification pipeline is trained from end to end. The 
      automatic 2-D summary can be displayed in a viewer or printed in a report to 
      support the decision. We show that the proposed 2-D summarization and 
      classification pipeline outperforms direct 3-D classification with the advantage 
      of improved interpretability.

LID - 10.1002/jemt.23178 [doi]
AB  - Atomic recognition of the Exudates (EXs), the major symbol of diabetic 
      retinopathy is essential for automated retinal images analysis. In this article, 
      we proposed a novel machine learning technique for early detection and 
      classification of EXs in color fundus images. The major challenge observed in the 
      classification technique is the selection of optimal features to reduce 
      computational time and space complexity and to provide a high degree of 
      classification accuracy. To address these challenges, this article proposed an 
      evolutionary algorithm based solution for optimal feature selection, which 
      accelerates the classification process and reduces computational complexity. 
      Similarly, three well-known classifiers that is, Naïve Bayes classifier, Support 
      Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network are used for the classification of 
      EXs. Moreover, an ensemble-based classifier is used for the selection of best 
      classifier on the basis of majority voting technique. Experiments are performed 
      on three well-known benchmark datasets and a real dataset developed at local 
      Hospital. It has been observed that the proposed technique achieved an accuracy 
      of 98% in the detection and classification of EXs in color fundus images.

AB  - AIMS: With growing concerns over complications in diabetes sufferers, this study 
      sought to develop an interpretable machine learning model to offer enhanced 
      diagnostic and treatment recommendations. METHODS: We assessed coronary heart 
      disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and fatty liver disease 
      using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and CatBoost algorithms. 
      The SHAP algorithm was employed to elucidate the model's predictions, offering a 
      more in-depth understanding of influential features. RESULTS: The CatBoost model 
      notably outperformed other algorithms in AUC, achieving an average AUC of 90.47 % 
      for the four complications. Through SHAP analysis and visualization, we provided 
      clear and actionable insights into risk factors, enabling better complication 
      risk assessment. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced an innovative, interpretable 
      complication risk model for people with diabetes. This not only offers a potent 
      tool for healthcare professionals but also empowers sufferers with clearer 
      self-assessment capabilities, encouraging earlier preventive actions. Further 
      studies will underscore the model's clinical applicability.

TI  - Multicolor image classification using the multimodal information bottleneck 
      network (MMIB-Net) for detecting diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 22732-22748
LID - 10.1364/OE.430508 [doi]
AB  - Multicolor (MC) imaging is an imaging modality that records confocal scanning 
      laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) fundus images, which can be used for the diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) detection. By utilizing this imaging technique, multiple modal 
      images can be obtained in a single case. Additional symptomatic features can be 
      obtained if these images are considered during the diagnosis of DR. However, few 
      studies have been carried out to classify MC Images using deep learning methods, 
      let alone using multi modal features for analysis. In this work, we propose a 
      novel model which uses the multimodal information bottleneck network (MMIB-Net) 
      to classify the MC Images for the detection of DR. Our model can extract the 
      features of multiple modalities simultaneously while finding concise feature 
      representations of each modality using the information bottleneck theory. MC 
      Images classification can be achieved by picking up the combined representations 
      and features of all modalities. In our experiments, it is shown that the proposed 
      method can achieve an accurate classification of MC Images. Comparative 
      experiments also demonstrate that the use of multimodality and information 
      bottleneck improves the performance of MC Images classification. To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first report of DR identification utilizing the 
      multimodal information bottleneck convolutional neural network in MC Images.

      Screening in India - Preliminary Results and Recommendations from a Pilot Study.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is regarded as a major cause of preventable 
      blindness, which can be detected and treated if the cases are identified by 
      screening. Screening for DR is therefore being practiced in developed countries, 
      and tele screening has been a prominent model of delivery of eye care for 
      screening DR. AIM: Our study has been designed to provide inputs on the 
      suitability of a computer-assisted DR screening solution, for use in a larger 
      prospective study. METHODS: Computer-assisted screening technology for grading 
      diabetic retinopathy from fundus images by a set of machine learning algorithms. 
      RESULTS: The preliminary recommendations from a pilot study of a system built 
      using the public datasets and retrospective images, showed a good sensitivity and 
      specificity. CONCLUSION: The machine learning algorithms has to be validated on a 
      larger dataset of a population level study.

LID - 10.3390/s19163584 [doi]
LID - 3584
AB  - The fast progress in research and development of multifunctional, distributed 
      sensor networks has brought challenges in processing data from a large number of 
      sensors. Using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), 
      it is possible to build smarter systems to forecasting future situations as well 
      as precisely classify large amounts of data from sensors. Multi-sensor data from 
      atmospheric pollutants measurements that involves five criteria, with the 
      underlying analytic model unknown, need to be categorized, so do the Diabetic 
      Retinopathy (DR) fundus images dataset. In this work, we created automatic 
      classifiers based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with two models, a 
      simpler feedforward model with dual modules and an Inception Resnet v2 model, and 
      various structural tweaks for classifying the data from the two tasks. For 
      segregating multi-sensor data, we trained a deep CNN-based classifier on an image 
      dataset extracted from the data by a novel image generating method. We created 
      two deepened and one reductive feedforward network for DR phase classification. 
      The validation accuracies and visualization results show that increasing deep CNN 
      structure depth or kernels number in convolutional layers will not indefinitely 
      improve the classification quality and that a more sophisticated model does not 
      necessarily achieve higher performance when training datasets are quantitatively 
      limited, while increasing training image resolution can induce higher 
      classification accuracies for trained CNNs. The methodology aims at providing 
      support for devising classification networks powering intelligent sensors.

TI  - An enumerative pre-processing approach for retinopathy severity grading using an 
      interpretable classifier: a comparative study.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-024-06396-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye complication that results 
      in permanent vision damage. As the number of patients suffering from DR 
      increases, so does the delay in treatment for DR diagnosis. To bridge this gap, 
      an efficient DR screening system that assists clinicians is required. Although 
      many artificial intelligence (AI) screening systems have been deployed in recent 
      years, accuracy remains a metric that can be improved. METHODS: An enumerative 
      pre-processing approach is implemented in the deep learning model to attain 
      better accuracies for DR severity grading. The proposed approach is compared with 
      various pre-trained models, and the necessary performance metrics were tabulated. 
      This paper also presents the comparative analysis of various optimization 
      algorithms that are utilized in the deep network model, and the results were 
      outlined. RESULTS: The experimental results are carried out on the MESSIDOR 
      dataset to assess the performance. The experimental results show that an 
      enumerative pipeline combination K1-K2-K3-DFNN-LOA shows better results when 
      compared with other combinations. When compared with various optimization 
      algorithms and pre-trained models, the proposed model has better performance with 
      maximum accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and macro-averaged metric of 
      97.60%, 94.60%, 98.40%, 94.60%, and 0.97, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study 
      focussed on developing and implementing a DR screening system on color fundus 
      photographs. This artificial intelligence-based system offers the possibility to 
      enhance the efficacy and approachability of DR diagnosis.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes, is the 
      leading cause of vision loss among working-aged adults. However, due to the low 
      compliance rate of DR screening and expensive medical devices for ophthalmic 
      exams, many DR patients did not seek proper medical attention until DR develops 
      to irreversible stages (i.e., vision loss). Fortunately, the widely available 
      electronic health record (EHR) databases provide an unprecedented opportunity to 
      develop cost-effective machine-learning tools for DR detection. This paper 
      proposes a Multi-branching Temporal Convolutional Network with Tensor Data 
      Completion (MB-TCN-TC) model to analyze the longitudinal EHRs collected from 
      diabetic patients for DR prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the 
      proposed MB-TCN-TC model not only effectively copes with the imbalanced data and 
      missing value issues commonly seen in EHR datasets but also captures the temporal 
      correlation and complicated interactions among medical variables in the 
      longitudinal clinical records, yielding superior prediction performance compared 
      to existing methods. Specifically, our MB-TCN-TC model provides AUROC and AUPRC 
      scores of 0.949 and 0.793 respectively, achieving an improvement of 6.27% on 
      AUROC, 11.85% on AUPRC, and 19.3% on F1 score compared with the traditional TCN 
      model.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy's signs, such as exudates (EXs) and aneurysms (ANs), 
      initially develop from under the retinal surface detectable from optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) images. Detecting these signs helps ophthalmologists 
      diagnose DR sooner. Detecting and segmenting exudates (EXs) and aneurysms (ANs) 
      in medical images is challenging due to their small size, similarity to other 
      hyperreflective regions, noise presence, and low background contrast. 
      Furthermore, the scarcity of public OCT images featuring these abnormalities has 
      limited the number of studies related to the automatic segmentation of EXs and 
      ANs, and the reported performance of such studies has not been satisfactory. This 
      work proposes an efficient algorithm that can automatically segment these 
      anomalies by improving key steps in the process. The potential area where these 
      hyper-reflective EXs and ANs occur was scoped by our method using a deep-learning 
      U-Net++ program. From this area, the candidates for EX-AN were segmented using 
      the adaptive thresholding method. Nine features based on appearances, locations, 
      and shadow markers were extracted from these candidates. They were trained and 
      tested using bagged tree ensemble classifiers to obtain only EX-AN blobs. The 
      proposed method was tested on a collection of a public dataset comprising 80 
      images with hand-drawn ground truths. The experimental results showed that our 
      method could segment EX-AN blobs with average recall, precision, and F1-measure 
      as 87.9%, 86.1%, and 87.0%, respectively. Its F1-measure drastically outperformed 
      two comparative methods, binary thresholding and watershed (BT-WS) and adaptive 
      thresholding with shadow tracking (AT-ST), by 78.0% and 82.1%, respectively.

AB  - In ophthalmology, intravitreal operative medication therapy (IVOM) is a 
      widespread treatment for diseases related to the age-related macular degeneration 
      (AMD), the diabetic macular edema, as well as the retinal vein occlusion. 
      However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of vision on 
      time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the visual acuity 
      (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under real-life 
      conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data. In this 
      contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a research-compatible 
      data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department of ophthalmology of a 
      German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus allows predictive 
      statements of the expected progression of a patient and his or her VA in each of 
      the three diseases. For the disease AMD, we found out a significant deterioration 
      of the visual acuity over time. Within our proposed multistage system, we 
      subsequently classify the VA progression into the three groups of therapy 
      "winners", "stabilizers", and "losers" (WSL classification scheme). Our OCT 
      biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a 
      classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98%, enabling us to complete 
      incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a more 
      precise VA modelling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA 
      examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict 
      the VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is 
      currently restricted to IVOM/no therapy. We achieve a final prediction accuracy 
      of 69% in macro average F1-score, while being in the same range as the 
      ophthalmologists with 57.8 and 50 ± 10.7 % F1-score.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the state of the art in image 
      classification, have proven to be as effective as an ophthalmologist, when 
      detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Having a size of [Formula: see text] of 
      the total image, microaneurysms are early lesions in diabetic retinopathy that 
      are difficult to classify. A model that includes two CNNs with different input 
      image sizes, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], was developed. These 
      models were trained using the Kaggle and Messidor datasets and tested 
      independently against the Kaggle dataset, showing a sensitivity [Formula: see 
      text], a specificity [Formula: see text], and an area under the receiver 
      operating characteristics curve [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, by combining 
      these trained models, there was a reduction of false positives for complete 
      images by about 50% and a sensitivity of 96% when tested against the DiaRetDB1 
      dataset. In addition, a powerful image preprocessing procedure was implemented, 
      improving not only images for annotations, but also decreasing the number of 
      epochs during training. Finally, a feedback method was developed increasing the 
      accuracy of the CNN [Formula: see text] input model.

TI  - Adherence of randomised controlled trials using artificial intelligence in 
      ophthalmology to CONSORT-AI guidelines: a systematic review and critical 
      appraisal.
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2023-100757 [doi]
LID - e100757
AB  - PURPOSE: Many efforts have been made to explore the potential of deep learning 
      and artificial intelligence (AI) in disciplines such as medicine, including 
      ophthalmology. This systematic review aims to evaluate the reporting quality of 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate AI technologies applied to 
      ophthalmology. METHODS: A comprehensive search of three relevant databases 
      (EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane) from 1 January 2010 to 5 February 2022 was conducted. 
      The reporting quality of these papers was scored using the Consolidated Standards 
      of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence (CONSORT-AI) checklist and further 
      risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 tool. RESULTS: The initial search 
      yielded 2973 citations from which 5 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion 
      criteria. These articles featured AI technologies applied to diabetic retinopathy 
      screening, ophthalmologic education, fungal keratitis detection and paediatric 
      cataract diagnosis. None of the articles reported all items in the CONSORT-AI 
      checklist. The overall mean CONSORT-AI score of the included RCTs was 53% (range 
      37%-78%). The individual scores of the articles were 37% (19/51), 39% (20), 49% 
      (25), 61% (31) and 78% (40). All articles were scored as being moderate risk, or 
      'some concerns present', regarding potential risk of bias according to the RoB-2 
      tool. CONCLUSION: A small number of RCTs have been published to date on the 
      applications of AI in ophthalmology and vision science. Adherence to the 2020 
      CONSORT-AI reporting guidelines is suboptimal with notable reporting items often 
      missed. Greater adherence will help facilitate reproducibility of AI research 
      which can be a stimulus for more AI-based RCTs and clinical applications in 
      ophthalmology.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate Pegasus optical coherence tomography (OCT), a clinical 
      decision support software for the identification of features of retinal disease 
      from macula OCT scans, across heterogenous populations involving varying patient 
      demographics, device manufacturers, acquisition sites, and operators. METHODS: 
      Five thousand five hundred and eighty-eight normal and anomalous macular OCT 
      volumes (162,721 B-scans), acquired at independent centers in five countries, 
      were processed using the software. Results were evaluated against ground truth 
      provided by the data set owners. RESULTS: Pegasus-OCT performed with areas under 
      the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of at least 98% for all data 
      sets in the detection of general macular anomalies. For scans of sufficient 
      quality, the areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic for 
      general age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema detection 
      were found to be at least 99% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ability of a 
      clinical decision support system to cater for different populations is key to its 
      adoption. Pegasus-OCT was shown to be able to detect age-related macular 
      degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and general anomalies in OCT volumes 
      acquired across multiple independent sites with high performance. Its use thus 
      offers substantial promise, with the potential to alleviate the burden of growing

AB  - With the advances in the computer field, methods and techniques in automatic 
      image processing and analysis provide the opportunity to detect automatically the 
      change and degeneration in retinal images. Localization of the optic disc is 
      extremely important for determining the hard exudate lesions or 
      neovascularization, which is the later phase of diabetic retinopathy, in computer 
      aided eye disease diagnosis systems. Whereas optic disc detection is fairly an 
      easy process in normal retinal images, detecting this region in the retinal image 
      which is diabetic retinopathy disease may be difficult. Sometimes information 
      related to optic disc and hard exudate information may be the same in terms of 
      machine learning. We presented a novel approach for efficient and accurate 
      localization of optic disc in retinal images having noise and other lesions. This 
      approach is comprised of five main steps which are image processing, keypoint 
      extraction, texture analysis, visual dictionary, and classifier techniques. We 
      tested our proposed technique on 3 public datasets and obtained quantitative 
      results. Experimental results show that an average optic disc detection accuracy 
      of 94.38%, 95.00%, and 90.00% is achieved, respectively, on the following public 
      datasets: DIARETDB1, DRIVE, and ROC.

TI  - Micro aneurysm detection using optimized residual-based temporal attention 
      Convolutional Neural Network with Inception-V3 transfer learning.
PG  - 908-921
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24478 [doi]
AB  - In this manuscript micro aneurysm detection using residual-based temporal 
      attention Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Inception-V3 transfer learning 
      optimized with equilibrium optimization algorithm (MA-RTCNN-Inception V3-EOA) is 
      proposed. The proposed research work contains four phases: (1) pre-processing, 
      (2) segmentation, (3) post-processing, and (4) classification. At first, guided 
      box filtering for contrast enhancement and background exclusion of input image. 
      The proposed MA-RTCNN-Inception V3-EOA based classification framework is 
      implemented in MATLAB using several performances evaluating metrics like 
      precision, sensitivity, f-measure, specificity, accuracy, classification error 
      rate, and Matthews's correlation coefficient and RoC analysis. The experimental 
      outcome demonstrates that the proposed method provides 23.56%, 14.99%, and 21.37% 
      higher accuracy and 31.26%, 57.69%, and 21.14% minimum classification error rate 
      compared to existing methods, such as diabetic retinopathy identification 
      utilizing prognosis of micro aneurysm and early diagnosis for non-proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy depending on deep learning approaches (DRD-CNN-NPDR), a 
      magnified adaptive feature pyramid network for automatic micro aneurysms 
      identification (MAFPN-AMD-MAFP-Net) respectively. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Micro 
      aneurysm detection using residual-based temporal attention Convolutional Neural 
      Network (CNN) is proposed. To get rid of the retina background, guided box 
      filtering is applied. COAT is used for segmenting the images into smaller parts 
      RTCNN is used for accurate micro aneurysms disease classification. RT-CNN 
      algorithm successfully identifies the micro aneurysms using EOA.

TI  - Risk Factors for Nondiagnostic Imaging in a Real-World Deployment of Artificial 
      Intelligence Diabetic Retinal Examinations in an Integrated Healthcare System: 
      Maximizing Workflow Efficiency Through Predictive Dilation.
PG  - 302-308
LID - 10.1177/19322968231201654 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the pivotal clinical trial that led to Food and Drug Administration 
      De Novo "approval" of the first fully autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) 
      diabetic retinal disease diagnostic system, a reflexive dilation protocol was 
      used. Using real-world deployment data before implementation of reflexive 
      dilation, we identified factors associated with nondiagnostic results. These 
      factors allow a novel predictive dilation workflow, where patients most likely to 
      benefit from pharmacologic dilation are dilated a priori to maximize efficiency 
      and patient satisfaction. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients who were 
      assessed with autonomous AI at Johns Hopkins Medicine (8/2020 to 5/2021). We 
      constructed a multivariable logistic regression model for nondiagnostic results 
      to compare characteristics of patients with and without diagnostic results, using 
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR). P < .05 was considered statistically significant. 
      RESULTS: Of 241 patients (59% female; median age = 59), 123 (51%) had 
      nondiagnostic results. In multivariable analysis, type 1 diabetes (T1D, aOR = 
      5.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-23.40, P = .01), smoking (aOR = 2.86, 
      95% CI: 1.36-5.99, P = .005), and age (every 10-year increase, aOR = 2.12, 95% 
      CI: 1.62-2.77, P < .001) were associated with nondiagnostic results. Following 
      feature elimination, a predictive model was created using T1D, smoking, age, 
      race, sex, and hypertension as inputs. The model showed an area under the 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve of 0.76 in five-fold cross-validation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We used factors associated with nondiagnostic results to design a 
      novel, predictive dilation workflow, where patients most likely to benefit from 
      pharmacologic dilation are dilated a priori. This new workflow has the potential 
      to be more efficient than reflexive dilation, thus maximizing the number of 
      at-risk patients receiving their diabetic retinal examinations.

TI  - Clinical Report Guided Retinal Microaneurysm Detection With Multi-Sieving Deep 
      Learning.
PG  - 1149-1161
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2018.2794988 [doi]
AB  - Timely detection and treatment of microaneurysms is a critical step to prevent 
      the development of vision-threatening eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. 
      However, detecting microaneurysms in fundus images is a highly challenging task 
      due to the low image contrast, misleading cues of other red lesions, and the 
      large variation of imaging conditions. Existing methods tend to fail in face of 
      the large intra-class variation and small inter-class variations for 
      microaneurysm detection in fundus images. Recently, hybrid text/image mining 
      computer-aided diagnosis systems have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the 
      semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus 
      on developing an interleaved deep mining technique to cope intelligently with the 
      unbalanced microaneurysm detection problem. Specifically, we present a clinical 
      report guided multi-sieving convolutional neural network, which leverages a small 
      amount of supervised information in clinical reports to identify the potential 
      microaneurysm regions via the image-to-text mapping in the feature space. These 
      potential microaneurysm regions are then interleaved with fundus image 
      information for multi-sieving deep mining in a highly unbalanced classification 
      problem. Critically, the clinical reports are employed to bridge the semantic gap 
      between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build 
      an efficient microaneurysm detection framework based on the hybrid text/image 
      interleaving and validate its performance on challenging clinical data sets 
      acquired from diabetic retinopathy patients. Extensive evaluations are carried 
      out in terms of fundus detection and classification. Experimental results show 
      that our framework achieves 99.7% precision and 87.8% recall, comparing favorably 
      with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Integration of expert domain knowledge and 
      image information demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the difficulty of 
      training classifiers under extremely unbalanced data distributions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The steadily growing and aging world population, in conjunction 
      with continuously increasing prevalences of vision-threatening retinal diseases, 
      is placing an increasing burden on the global healthcare system. The main 
      challenges within retinology involve identifying the comparatively few patients 
      requiring therapy within the large mass, the assurance of comprehensive screening 
      for retinal disease and individualized therapy planning. In order to sustain 
      high-quality ophthalmic care in the future, the incorporation of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) technologies into our clinical practice represents a potential 
      solution. AREAS COVERED: This review sheds light onto already realized and 
      promising future applications of AI techniques in retinal imaging. The main 
      attention is directed at the application in diabetic retinopathy and age-related 
      macular degeneration. The principles of use in disease screening, grading, 
      therapeutic planning and prediction of future developments are explained based on 
      the currently available literature. EXPERT OPINION: The recent accomplishments of 
      AI in retinal imaging indicate that its implementation into our daily practice is 
      likely to fundamentally change the ophthalmic healthcare system and bring us one 
      step closer to the goal of individualized treatment. However, it must be 
      emphasized that the aim is to optimally support clinicians by gradually 
      incorporating AI approaches, rather than replacing ophthalmologists.

TI  - OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY BIOMARKERS TO DISTINGUISH DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA 
      FROM PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS.
PG  - 2283-2291

AB  - PURPOSE: In diabetic patients presenting with macular edema (ME) shortly after 
      cataract surgery, identifying the underlying pathology can be challenging and 
      influence management. Our aim was to develop a simple clinical classifier able to 
      confirm a diabetic etiology using few spectral domain optical coherence 
      tomography parameters. METHODS: We analyzed spectral domain optical coherence 
      tomography data of 153 patients with either pseudophakic cystoid ME (n = 57), 
      diabetic ME (n = 86), or "mixed" (n = 10). We used advanced machine learning 
      algorithms to develop a predictive classifier using the smallest number of 
      parameters. RESULTS: Most differentiating were the existence of hard exudates, 
      hyperreflective foci, subretinal fluid, ME pattern, and the location of cysts 
      within retinal layers. Using only 3 to 6 spectral domain optical coherence 
      tomography parameters, we achieved a sensitivity of 94% to 98%, specificity of 
      94% to 95%, and an area under the curve of 0.937 to 0.987 (depending on the 
      method) for confirming a diabetic etiology. A simple decision flowchart achieved 
      a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 95%, and an area under the curve of 0.937. 
      CONCLUSION: Confirming a diabetic etiology for edema in cases with uncertainty 
      between diabetic cystoid ME and pseudophakic ME was possible using few spectral 
      domain optical coherence tomography parameters with high accuracy. We propose a 
      clinical decision flowchart for cases with uncertainty, which may support the 
      decision for intravitreal injections rather than topical treatment.

TI  - Prediction of retinopathy progression using deep learning on retinal images 
      within the Scottish screening programme.
PG  - 833-839
LID - 10.1136/bjo-2023-323400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: National guidelines of many countries set screening intervals 
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on grading of the last screening retinal 
      images. We explore the potential of deep learning (DL) on images to predict 
      progression to referable DR beyond DR grading, and the potential impact on 
      assigned screening intervals, within the Scottish screening programme. METHODS: 
      We consider 21 346 and 247 233 people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively, each contributing on average 4.8 
      and 4.4 screening intervals of which 1339 and 4675 intervals concluded with a 
      referable screening episode. Information extracted from fundus images using DL 
      was used to predict referable status at the end of interval and its predictive 
      value in comparison to screening-assigned DR grade was assessed. RESULTS: The DL 
      predictor increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in 
      comparison to a predictor using current DR grades from 0.809 to 0.87 for T1DM and 
      from 0.825 to 0.87 for T2DM. Expected sojourn time-the time from becoming 
      referable to being rescreened-was found to be 3.4 (T1DM) and 2.7 (T2DM) weeks 
      less for a DL-derived policy compared with the current recall policy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We showed that, compared with using the current retinopathy grade, 
      DL of fundus images significantly improves the prediction of incident referable 
      retinopathy before the next screening episode. This can impact screening recall 
      interval policy positively, for example, by reducing the expected time with 
      referable disease for a fixed workload-which we show as an exemplar. 
      Additionally, it could be used to optimise workload for a fixed sojourn time.

AB  - We described a challenge named "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)-Grading and Image 
      Quality Estimation Challenge" in conjunction with ISBI 2020 to hold three 
      sub-challenges and develop deep learning models for DR image assessment and 
      grading. The scientific community responded positively to the challenge, with 34 
      submissions from 574 registrations. In the challenge, we provided the DeepDRiD 
      dataset containing 2,000 regular DR images (500 patients) and 256 ultra-widefield 
      images (128 patients), both having DR quality and grading annotations. We 
      discussed details of the top 3 algorithms in each sub-challenges. The weighted 
      kappa for DR grading ranged from 0.93 to 0.82, and the accuracy for image quality 
      evaluation ranged from 0.70 to 0.65. The results showed that image quality 
      assessment can be used as a further target for exploration. We also have released 
      the DeepDRiD dataset on GitHub to help develop automatic systems and improve 
      human judgment in DR screening and diagnosis.

TI  - Optimizing the OCTA layer fusion option for deep learning classification of 
      diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 4713-4724
LID - 10.1364/BOE.495999 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate layer fusion options for deep learning 
      classification of optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) images. A 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) end-to-end classifier was utilized to classify 
      OCTA images from healthy control subjects and diabetic patients with no 
      retinopathy (NoDR) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). For each 
      eye, three en-face OCTA images were acquired from the superficial capillary 
      plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC) layers. The 
      performances of the CNN classifier with individual layer inputs and multi-layer 
      fusion architectures, including early-fusion, intermediate-fusion, and 
      late-fusion, were quantitatively compared. For individual layer inputs, the 
      superficial OCTA was observed to have the best performance, with 87.25% accuracy, 
      78.26% sensitivity, and 90.10% specificity, to differentiate control, NoDR, and 
      NPDR. For multi-layer fusion options, the best option is the intermediate-fusion 
      architecture, which achieved 92.65% accuracy, 87.01% sensitivity, and 94.37% 
      specificity. To interpret the deep learning performance, the Gradient-weighted 
      Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was utilized to identify spatial 
      characteristics for OCTA classification. Comparative analysis indicates that the 
      layer data fusion options can affect the performance of deep learning 
      classification, and the intermediate-fusion approach is optimal for OCTA 
      classification of DR.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is not just the most common complication of diabetes but 
      also the leading cause of adult blindness. Currently, doctors determine the cause 
      of diabetic retinopathy primarily by diagnosing fundus images. Large-scale manual 
      screening is difficult to achieve for retinal health screen. In this paper, we 
      proposed an improved U-net network for segmenting retinal vessels. Firstly, due 
      to the lack of retinal data, pre-processing of the raw data is required. The data 
      processed by grayscale transformation, normalization, CLAHE, gamma 
      transformation. Data augmentation can prevent overfitting in the training 
      process. Secondly, the basic network structure model U-net is built, and the 
      Bi-FPN network is fused based on U-net. Datasets from a public challenge are used 
      to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which is able to detect 
      vessel SP of 0.8604, SE of 0.9767, ACC of 0.9651, and AUC of 0.9787.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing area that relies on the heavy use of 
      diagnostic imaging within the field of retina to offer exciting advancements in 
      diagnostic capability to better understand and manage retinal conditions such as 
      diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, 
      and retinopathy of prematurity. However, there are discrepancies between the 
      findings of these AI programs and their referral recommendations compared with 
      evidence-based referral patterns, such as Preferred Practice Patterns by the 
      American Academy of Ophthalmology. The overall focus of this task force report is 
      to first describe the work in AI being completed in the management of retinal 
      conditions. This report also discusses the guidelines of the Preferred Practice 
      Pattern and how they can be used in the emerging field of AI.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the quantification of intraretinal hard exudate (HE) using en 
      face optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography. METHODS: 
      Consecutive en face images and corresponding fundus photographs from 13 eyes of 
      10 patients with macular edema associated with diabetic retinopathy or Coats' 
      disease were analyzed using the machine-learning-based image analysis tool, 
      "ilastik." RESULTS: The overall measured HE area was greater with en face images 
      than with fundus photos (en face: 0.49 ± 0.35 mm2 vs. fundus photo: 0.34 ± 0.34 
      mm2, P < 0.001). However, there was an excellent correlation between the two 
      measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.844). There was a 
      negative correlation between HE area and central macular thickness (CMT) (r = 
      -0.292, P = 0.001). However, HE area showed a positive correlation with CMT in 
      the previous several months, especially in eyes treated with anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (CMT 3 months before: r = 0.349, P = 
      0.001; CMT 4 months before: r = 0.287, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Intraretinal HE 
      can be reliably quantified from either en face OCT images or fundus photography 
      with the aid of an interactive machine learning-based image analysis tool. HE 
      area changes lagged several months behind CMT changes, especially in eyes treated 
      with anti-VEGF injections.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic noncommunicable disease, the main 
      manifestation of which is the long-term high blood sugar level in patients due to 
      metabolic disorders. However, due to excessive reliance on the clinical 
      experience of ophthalmologists, our diagnosis takes a long time, and it is prone 
      to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In recent years, with the development of 
      deep learning, its application in the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy 
      has become possible. How to use the powerful feature extraction ability of deep 
      learning algorithm to realize the mining of massive medical data is of great 
      significance. Therefore, under the action of computer-aided technology, this 
      paper processes and analyzes the retinal images of the fundus through traditional 
      image processing and convolutional neural network-related methods, so as to 
      achieve the role of assisting clinical treatment. Based on the admission records 
      of diabetic patients after data analysis and feature processing, this paper uses 
      an improved convolutional neural network algorithm to establish a model for 
      predicting changes in diabetic conditions. The model can assist doctors to judge 
      the patient's treatment effect by using it based on the case records of inpatient 
      diagnosis and treatment and to predict the risk of readmission of inpatients 
      after discharge. It also can help to judge the effectiveness of the treatment 
      plan. The results of the study show that the model proposed in this paper has a 
      lower probability of misjudging patients with poor recovery as good recovery, and 
      the prediction is more accurate.

AB  - Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is an advanced stage of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) 
      and can lead to permanent vision loss. Currently, it affects 26.7 million people 
      globally and on account of such a huge number of DME cases and the limited number 
      of ophthalmologists, it is desirable to automate the diagnosis process. 
      Computer-assisted, deep learning based diagnosis could help in early detection, 
      following which precision medication can help to mitigate the vision loss. 
      METHOD: In order to automate the screening of DME, we propose a novel DMENet 
      Algorithm which is built on the pillars of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
      DMENet analyses the preprocessed color fundus images and passes it through a 
      two-stage pipeline. The first stage detects the presence or absence of DME 
      whereas the second stage takes only the positive cases and grades the images 
      based on severity. In both the stages, we use a novel Hierarchical Ensemble of 
      CNNs (HE-CNN). This paper uses two of the popular publicly available datasets 
      IDRiD and MESSIDOR for classification. Preprocessing on the images is performed 
      using morphological opening and gaussian kernel. The dataset is augmented to 
      solve the class imbalance problem for better performance of the proposed model. 
      RESULTS: The proposed methodology achieved an average Accuracy of 96.12%, 
      Sensitivity of 96.32%, Specificity of 95.84%, and F-1 score of 0.9609 on MESSIDOR 
      and IDRiD datasets. CONCLUSION: These excellent results establish the validity of 
      the proposed methodology for use in DME screening and solidifies the 
      applicability of the HE-CNN classification technique in the domain of biomedical 
      imaging.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to "the ability of a digital machine or 
      computer to accomplish tasks that traditionally have required human 
      intelligence." These days, artificial intelligence is becoming popular in 
      healthcare and more so in ophthalmology. It has shown promising results in 
      diabetic retinopathy detection and referral. Recently, Indian data has depicted 
      that the new algorithms can be generalized to the Indian population as well. An 
      increased understanding of the tools is required especially by the practitioners 
      and medical researchers so that they can contribute meaningfully to the 
      development of the technology and not become mere data providers and data 
      labelers. While AI is extensively being used by finance, marketing and travel 
      industry, its application is more recent in medicine. The applications based on 
      artificial intelligence have the potential to benefit all stakeholders in the 
      healthcare industry.

TI  - Automatic Screening for Ocular Anomalies Using Fundus Photographs.
PG  - 281-291
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001845 [doi]
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Screening for ocular anomalies using fundus photography is key to 
      prevent vision impairment and blindness. With the growing and aging population, 
      automated algorithms that can triage fundus photographs and provide instant 
      referral decisions are relevant to scale-up screening and face the shortage of 
      ophthalmic expertise. PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a deep learning 
      algorithm that detects any ocular anomaly in fundus photographs and to evaluate 
      this algorithm for "normal versus anomalous" eye examination classification in 
      the diabetic and general populations. METHODS: The deep learning algorithm was 
      developed and evaluated in two populations: the diabetic and general populations. 
      Our patient cohorts consist of 37,129 diabetic patients from the OPHDIAT diabetic 
      retinopathy screening network in Paris, France, and 7356 general patients from 
      the OphtaMaine private screening network, in Le Mans, France. Each data set was 
      divided into a development subset and a test subset of more than 4000 
      examinations each. For ophthalmologist/algorithm comparison, a subset of 2014 
      examinations from the OphtaMaine test subset was labeled by a second 
      ophthalmologist. First, the algorithm was trained on the OPHDIAT development 
      subset. Then, it was fine-tuned on the OphtaMaine development subset. RESULTS: On 
      the OPHDIAT test subset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve for normal versus anomalous classification was 0.9592. On the OphtaMaine 
      test subset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 
      0.8347 before fine-tuning and 0.9108 after fine-tuning. On the 
      ophthalmologist/algorithm comparison subset, the second ophthalmologist achieved 
      a specificity of 0.8648 and a sensitivity of 0.6682. For the same specificity, 
      the fine-tuned algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.8248. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed algorithm compares favorably with human performance for normal versus 
      anomalous eye examination classification using fundus photography. Artificial 
      intelligence, which previously targeted a few retinal pathologies, can be used to 
      screen for ocular anomalies comprehensively.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent vision-threatening disease worldwide. 
      Laser marks are the scars left after panretinal photocoagulation, a treatment to 
      prevent patients with severe DR from losing vision. In this study, we develop a 
      deep learning algorithm based on the lightweight U-Net to segment laser marks 
      from the color fundus photos, which could help indicate a stage or providing 
      valuable auxiliary information for the care of DR patients. We prepared our 
      training and testing data, manually annotated by trained and experienced graders 
      from Image Reading Center, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, publicly available to 
      fill the vacancy of public image datasets dedicated to the segmentation of laser 
      marks. The lightweight U-Net, along with two postprocessing procedures, achieved 
      an AUC of 0.9824, an optimal sensitivity of 94.16%, and an optimal specificity of 
      92.82% on the segmentation of laser marks in fundus photographs. With accurate 
      segmentation and high numeric metrics, the lightweight U-Net method showed its 
      reliable performance in automatically segmenting laser marks in fundus 
      photographs, which could help the AI assist the diagnosis of DR in the severe 
      stage.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) at risk of vision loss (referable DR) needs to be 
      identified by retinal screening and referred to an ophthalmologist. Existing 
      automated algorithms have mostly been developed from images acquired with high 
      cost mydriatic retinal cameras and cannot be applied in the settings used in most 
      low- and middle-income countries. In this prospective multicentre study, we 
      developed a deep learning system (DLS) that detects referable DR from retinal 
      images acquired using handheld non-mydriatic fundus camera by non-technical field 
      workers in 20 sites across India. Macula-centred and optic-disc-centred images 
      from 16,247 eyes (9778 participants) were used to train and cross-validate the 
      DLS and risk factor based logistic regression models. The DLS achieved an AUROC 
      of 0.99 (1000 times bootstrapped 95% CI 0.98-0.99) using two-field retinal 
      images, with 93.86 (91.34-96.08) sensitivity and 96.00 (94.68-98.09) specificity 
      at the Youden's index operational point. With single field inputs, the DLS 
      reached AUROC of 0.98 (0.98-0.98) for the macula field and 0.96 (0.95-0.98) for 
      the optic-disc field. Intergrader performance was 90.01 (88.95-91.01) sensitivity 
      and 96.09 (95.72-96.42) specificity. The image based DLS outperformed all risk 
      factor-based models. This DLS demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance 
      for the identification of referable DR despite challenging image capture 
      conditions.

TI  - Fusion of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Microaneurysm Detection in Color 
      Fundus Images.
PG  - 3705-3708
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513035 [doi]
AB  - Microaneurysms (MAs) are common signsof several diseases, appearing as small 
      circular darkish spots in color fundus images. The presence of even a single MA 
      may suggest diseases (e.g. diabetic retinopathy), thus, their reliable 
      recognition is a critical issue in both human clinical practice and 
      computer-aided systems. As for their automatic recognition, deep learning 
      techniques became very popular in the recent years. In this paper, we also apply 
      such deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based techniques; however, we 
      organize them into a supernetwork with a fusionbased approach. The combination of 
      the member DCNNs is achieved with interconnecting them in a joint fully-connected 
      layer. The advantage of the method is that this large architecture can be trained 
      as a single neural network, and thus, the member DCNNs are also trained with 
      taking the predictions of the other members into consideration. The 
      competitiveness of our approach is also validated with experimental studies, 
      where the ensemble-based system outperformed each member DCNN. As a primary 
      application domain with strong clinical motivation, the methodology was tested 
      for image-level classification. More specifically, a retinal image is divided 
      into subimages to provide the required inputs for the DCNN-based architecture, 
      and the whole image is labeled as a positive case, if the presence of MA is 
      predicted in any of the subimages. Additionally, we also demonstrate how our 
      architecture can be trained to accurately localize MAs with training only the 
      local neighborhoods of the lesions; empirical tests showing solid performance are 
      also enclosed.

TI  - CoT-XNet: contextual transformer with Xception network for diabetic retinopathy 
      grading.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac9fa0 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading is primarily performed by assessing 
      fundus images. Many types of lesions, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and 
      soft exudates, are available simultaneously in a single image. However, their 
      sizes may be small, making it difficult to differentiate adjacent DR grades even 
      using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, a vision transformer 
      has shown comparable or even superior performance to CNNs, and it also learns 
      different visual representations from CNNs. Inspired by this finding, we propose 
      a two-path contextual transformer with Xception network (CoT-XNet) to improve the 
      accuracy of DR grading.Approach.The representations learned by CoT through one 
      path and those by the Xception network through another path are concatenated 
      before the fully connected layer. Meanwhile, the dedicated pre-processing, data 
      resampling, and test time augmentation strategies are implemented. The 
      performance of CoT-XNet is evaluated in the publicly available datasets of DDR, 
      APTOS2019, and EyePACS, which include over 50 000 images. Ablation experiments 
      and comprehensive comparisons with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) models have 
      also been performed.Main results.Our proposed CoT-XNet shows better performance 
      than available SOTA models, and the accuracy and Kappa are 83.10% and 0.8496, 
      84.18% and 0.9000 and 84.10% and 0.7684 respectively, in the three datasets 
      (listed above). Class activation maps of CoT and Xception networks are different 
      and complementary in most images.Significance.By concatenating the different 
      visual representations learned by CoT and Xception networks, CoT-XNet can 
      accurately grade DR from fundus images and present good generalizability. 
      CoT-XNet will promote the application of artificial intelligence-based systems in 
      the DR screening of large-scale populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to establish diagnostic technology to 
      automatically grade the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) according to the 
      ischemic index and leakage index with ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography 
      (UWFA) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) 7-standard 
      field (7-SF). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. UWFA samples from 280 
      diabetic patients and 119 normal patients were used to train and test an 
      artificial intelligence model to differentiate PDR and NPDR based on the ischemic 
      index and leakage index with UWFA. A panel of retinal specialists determined the 
      ground truth for our data set before experimentation. A confusion matrix as a 
      metric was used to measure the precision of our algorithm, and a simple linear 
      regression function was implemented to explore the discrimination of indexes on 
      the DR grades. In addition, the model was tested with simulated 7-SF. RESULTS: 
      The model classification of DR in the original UWFA images achieved 88.50% 
      accuracy and 73.68% accuracy in the simulated 7-SF images. A simple linear 
      regression function demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between 
      the ischemic index and leakage index and the severity of DR. These two thresholds 
      were set to classify the grade of DR, which achieved 76.8% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The optimization of the cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) model classifier achieved DR grading based on 
      the ischemic index and leakage index with UWFA and simulated 7-SF and provided 
      accurate inference results. The classification accuracy with UWFA is slightly 
      higher than that of simulated 7-SF.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate a deep learning model that can transform color 
      fundus (CF) photography into corresponding venous and late-phase fundus 
      fluorescein angiography (FFA) images. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: We included 51 370 CF-venous FFA pairs and 14 644 CF-late FFA pairs 
      from 4438 patients for model development. External testing involved 50 eyes with 
      CF-FFA pairs and 2 public datasets for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification, 
      with 86 952 CF from EyePACs, and 1744 CF from MESSIDOR2. METHODS: We trained a 
      deep-learning model to transform CF into corresponding venous and late-phase FFA 
      images. The translated FFA images' quality was evaluated quantitatively on the 
      internal test set and subjectively on 100 eyes with CF-FFA paired images (50 from 
      external), based on the realisticity of the global image, anatomical landmarks 
      (macula, optic disc, and vessels), and lesions. Moreover, we validated the 
      clinical utility of the translated FFA for classifying 5-class DR and diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) in the EyePACs and MESSIDOR2 datasets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Image generation was quantitatively assessed by structural similarity measures 
      (SSIM), and subjectively by 2 clinical experts on a 5-point scale (1 refers real 
      FFA); intragrader agreement was assessed by kappa. The DR classification accuracy 
      was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: 
      The SSIM of the translated FFA images were > 0.6, and the subjective quality 
      scores ranged from 1.37 to 2.60. Both experts reported similar quality scores 
      with substantial agreement (all kappas > 0.8). Adding the generated FFA on top of 
      CF improved DR classification in the EyePACs and MESSIDOR2 datasets, with the 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.912 to 
      0.939 on the EyePACs dataset and from 0.952 to 0.972 on the MESSIDOR2 dataset. 
      The DME area under the receiver operating characteristic curve also increased 
      from 0.927 to 0.974 in the MESSIDOR2 dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our CF-to-FFA 
      framework produced realistic FFA images. Moreover, adding the translated FFA 
      images on top of CF improved the accuracy of DR screening. These results suggest 
      that CF-to-FFA translation could be used as a surrogate method when FFA 
      examination is not feasible and as a simple add-on to improve DR screening.

TI  - Identifying the Key Components in ResNet-50 for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading from 
      Fundus Images: A Systematic Investigation.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13101664 [doi]
LID - 1664
AB  - Although deep learning-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification methods 
      typically benefit from well-designed architectures of convolutional neural 
      networks, the training setting also has a non-negligible impact on prediction 
      performance. The training setting includes various interdependent components, 
      such as an objective function, a data sampling strategy, and a data augmentation 
      approach. To identify the key components in a standard deep learning framework 
      (ResNet-50) for DR grading, we systematically analyze the impact of several major 
      components. Extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset 
      EyePACS. We demonstrate that (1) the DR grading framework is sensitive to input 
      resolution, objective function, and composition of data augmentation; (2) using 
      mean square error as the loss function can effectively improve the performance 
      with respect to a task-specific evaluation metric, namely the quadratically 
      weighted Kappa; (3) utilizing eye pairs boosts the performance of DR grading and; 
      (4) using data resampling to address the problem of imbalanced data distribution 
      in EyePACS hurts the performance. Based on these observations and an optimal 
      combination of the investigated components, our framework, without any 
      specialized network design, achieves a state-of-the-art result (0.8631 for Kappa) 
      on the EyePACS test set (a total of 42,670 fundus images) with only image-level 
      labels. We also examine the proposed training practices on other fundus datasets 
      and other network architectures to evaluate their generalizability. Our codes and 
      pre-trained model are available online.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss globally 
      with a severe burden on all societies due to its high treatment and 
      rehabilitation costs. The early diagnosis of DR may provide preventive steps 
      (including retinal laser therapy and tight carbohydrate, blood pressure, and 
      cholesterol control) that could in turn help to avoid progression of the 
      pathology with the resultant vision loss. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      enables the in vivo structural imaging of the retina, providing both qualitative 
      (structure) and quantitative (thickness) information. In the past decades, 
      extensive OCT research has been done in the field of DR. In the present review, 
      we are focusing on those that were aiming at detection of the earliest retinal 
      changes before DR could be diagnosed funduscopically. The latest, widely 
      available technology of spectral-domain (SD-)OCT comes with a fast and reliable 
      retinal imaging, which, together with the most recent developments in image 
      processing and artificial intelligence, holds the promise of developing a quick 
      and efficient, state-of-the-art screening tool for DR.

AB  - AIM: To summarize the application of deep learning in detecting ophthalmic 
      disease with ultrawide-field fundus images and analyze the advantages, 
      limitations, and possible solutions common to all tasks. METHODS: We searched 
      three academic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid, with the 
      date of August 2022. We matched and screened according to the target keywords and 
      publication year and retrieved a total of 4358 research papers according to the 
      keywords, of which 23 studies were retrieved on applying deep learning in 
      diagnosing ophthalmic disease with ultrawide-field images. RESULTS: Deep learning 
      in ultrawide-field images can detect various ophthalmic diseases and achieve 
      great performance, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular 
      degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, retinal detachment, and other peripheral 
      retinal diseases. Compared to fundus images, the ultrawide-field fundus scanning 
      laser ophthalmoscopy enables the capture of the ocular fundus up to 200° in a 
      single exposure, which can observe more areas of the retina. CONCLUSION: The 
      combination of ultrawide-field fundus images and artificial intelligence will 
      achieve great performance in diagnosing multiple ophthalmic diseases in the 
      future.

TI  - Deep Learning Technology Applied to Medical Image Tissue Classification.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12102430 [doi]
LID - 2430
AB  - Medical image classification is a novel technology that presents a new challenge. 
      It is essential that pathological images are automatically and correctly 
      classified to enable doctors to provide precise treatment. Convolutional neural 
      networks have demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying images in deep 
      learning, which may have dozens or hundreds of layers, to illustrate the 
      relationship between them in terms of their different neural network features. 
      Convolutional layers consisting of small kernels take weights as input and guide 
      them through an activation function as output. The main advantage of using 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs) instead of traditional neural networks is 
      that they reduce the model parameters for greater accuracy. However, many studies 
      have simply been focused on finding the best CNN model and classification results 
      from a single medical image classification. Therefore, we applied a common deep 
      learning network model in an attempt to identify the best model framework by 
      training and validating different model parameters to classify medical images. 
      After conducting experiments on six publicly available databases of pathological 
      images, including colorectal cancer tissue, chest X-rays, common skin lesions, 
      diabetic retinopathy, pediatric chest X-ray, and breast ultrasound image 
      datasets, we were able to confirm that the recognition accuracy of the Inception 
      V3 method was significantly better than that of other existing deep learning 
      models.

AB  - In this pilot study, we evaluated the potential of computational image analysis 
      of optical coherence tomography (OCT) data to determine the prognosis of patients 
      with diabetic macular edema (DME). Spectral-domain OCT scans with fully automated 
      retinal layer segmentation and segmentation of intraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) 
      and subretinal fluid of 629 patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth 
      factor therapy for DME in a randomized prospective clinical trial were analyzed. 
      The results were used to define 312 potentially predictive features at three 
      timepoints (baseline, weeks 12 and 24) for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 
      baseline and after one year used in a random forest prediction path. 
      Preliminarily, IRC in the outer nuclear layer in the 3-mm area around the fovea 
      seemed to have the greatest predictive value for BCVA at baseline, and IRC and 
      the total retinal thickness in the 3-mm area at weeks 12 and 24 for BCVA after 
      one year. The overall model accuracy was R(2)=0.21/0.23 (p<0.001). The outcomes 
      of this pilot analysis highlight the great potential of the proposed 
      machine-learning approach for large-scale image data analysis in DME and other 
      retinal diseases.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a vision-threatening complication of diabetes. 
      Timely diagnosis and intervention are essential for treatment that reduces the 
      risk of vision loss. A good color retinal (fundus) photograph can be used as a 
      surrogate for face-to-face evaluation of DR. The use of computers to assist or 
      fully automate DR evaluation from retinal images has been studied for many years. 
      Early work showed promising results for algorithms in detecting and classifying 
      DR pathology. Newer techniques include those that adapt machine learning 
      technology to DR image analysis. Challenges remain, however, that must be 
      overcome before fully automatic DR detection and analysis systems become 
      practical clinical tools.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Automatic Neovascularization Detection on Optic Disc 
      Region.
PG  - 886-894
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2710201 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, the automatic detection of neovascularization in the optic disc 
      region (NVD) for color fundus retinal image is presented. NV is the indicator for 
      the onset of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and it is featured by the 
      presence of new vessels in the retina. The new vessels are fragile and pose a 
      high risk for sudden vision loss. Therefore, the importance of accurate and 
      timely detection of NV cannot be underestimated. We propose an automatic image 
      processing procedure for NVD detection that involves vessel segmentation using 
      multilevel Gabor filtering, feature extraction of vessel morphological features 
      and texture features, and image classification with support vector machine. Forty 
      two features are extracted from each NVD image and feature selection procedure 
      further reduce the optimal feature dimension to 18. The selected features are 
      trained and tested on 424 retinal images, which contains 134 NVD and 290 non-NVD 
      images. We achieved an average accuracy of 95.23%, specificity of 96.30%, 
      sensitivity of 92.90%, and area under curve value of 98.51% on the randomly 
      selected test set.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a highly threatening microvascular 
      complication of diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients must be screened annually 
      for DR; however, it is practically not viable due to the high volume of patients, 
      lack of resources, economic burden, and cost of the screening procedure. The use 
      of machine learning (ML) classifiers in medical science is an emerging frontier 
      and can help in assisted diagnosis. The few available proposed models perform 
      best when used in similar population cohorts and their external validation has 
      been questioned. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to classify the DR 
      using different ML methods on Saudi diabetic data, propose the best method based 
      on accuracy and identify the most discriminative interpretable features using the 
      socio-demographic and clinical information. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 327 diabetic patients in Almajmaah, 
      Saudi Arabia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using a 
      systematic random sampling technique. For DR classification, ML algorithm 
      including, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K nearest 
      neighbor, random forest and its variate ranger random forest classifiers were 
      used through cross-validation resampling procedure. RESULTS: In classifying DR, 
      ranger random forest outperforms the other methods by accurately classifying 86% 
      of the DR patients on the test data. HbA1c (p<0.001) and duration of diabetes 
      (p<0.001) were the most influential risk factor that best discriminated the DR 
      patients. Other influential risk factors were the body mass index (p<0.001), 
      age-onset (p<0.001), age (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (p<0.05), and the use 
      of medication (p<0.05) that significantly discriminated the DR patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present study findings, integrating ophthalmology and 
      ML can transform diagnosing the disease pattern that can help generate a 
      compelling clinical effect. ML can be used as an added tool for clinical 
      decision-making and must not be the sole substitute for a clinician. We will work 
      to examine the classification performance of multi-class data using more 
      sophisticated ML methods.

TI  - Exporting Diabetic Retinopathy Images from VA VistA Imaging for Research.
PG  - 832-840
LID - 10.1007/s10278-018-0153-0 [doi]
AB  - The US Department of Veterans Affairs has been acquiring store and forward 
      digital diabetic retinopathy surveillance retinal fundus images for remote 
      reading since 2007. There are 900+ retinal cameras at 756 acquisition sites. 
      These images are manually read remotely at 134 sites. A total of 2.1 million 
      studies have been performed in the teleretinal imaging program. The human 
      workload for reading images is rapidly growing. It would be ideal to develop an 
      automated computer algorithm that detects multiple eye diseases as this would 
      help standardize interpretations and improve efficiency of the image readers. 
      Deep learning algorithms for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus 
      photographs have been developed and there are needs for additional image data to 
      validate this work. To further this research, the Atlanta VA Health Care System 
      (VAHCS) has extracted 112,000 DICOM diabetic retinopathy surveillance images 
      (13,000 studies) that can be subsequently used for the validation of automated 
      algorithms. An extensive amount of associated clinical information was added to 
      the DICOM header of each exported image to facilitate correlation of the image 
      with the patient's medical condition. The clinical information was saved as a 
      JSON object and stored in a single Unlimited Text (VR = UT) DICOM data element. 
      This paper describes the methodology used for this project and the results of 
      applying this methodology.

TI  - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy characterization based on fractal features: 
      Evaluation on a publicly available dataset.
PG  - 6425-6434
LID - 10.1002/mp.12627 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most widespread causes of 
      preventable blindness in the world. The most dangerous stage of this condition is 
      proliferative DR (PDR), in which the risk of vision loss is high and treatments 
      are less effective. Fractal features of the retinal vasculature have been 
      previously explored as potential biomarkers of DR, yet the current literature is 
      inconclusive with respect to their correlation with PDR. In this study, we 
      experimentally assess their discrimination ability to recognize PDR cases. 
      METHODS: A statistical analysis of the viability of using three reference fractal 
      characterization schemes - namely box, information, and correlation dimensions - 
      to identify patients with PDR is presented. These descriptors are also evaluated 
      as input features for training ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularized logistic regression 
      classifiers, to estimate their performance. RESULTS: Our results on MESSIDOR, a 
      public dataset of 1200 fundus photographs, indicate that patients with PDR are 
      more likely to exhibit a higher fractal dimension than healthy subjects or 
      patients with mild levels of DR (P≤1.3×10-2). Moreover, a supervised classifier 
      trained with both fractal measurements and red lesion-based features reports an 
      area under the ROC curve of 0.93 for PDR screening and 0.96 for detecting 
      patients with optic disc neovascularizations. CONCLUSIONS: The fractal dimension 
      of the vasculature increases with the level of DR. Furthermore, PDR screening 
      using multiscale fractal measurements is more feasible than using their derived 
      fractal dimensions. Code and further resources are provided at

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) techniques 
      applied to radiomic features extracted from OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) images 
      for diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and referable DR (R-DR) 
      diagnosis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a retinal image dataset from a 
      previous prospective OCTA study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT03422965). PARTICIPANTS: 
      Patients with type 1 DM and controls included in the progenitor study. METHODS: 
      Radiomic features were extracted from fundus retinographies, OCT, and OCTA images 
      in each study eye. Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, support 
      vector classifier (SVC)-linear, SVC-radial basis function, and random forest 
      models were created to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy for DM, DR, and R-DR 
      diagnosis in all image types. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) mean and standard deviation for each ML 
      model and each individual and combined image types. RESULTS: A dataset of 726 
      eyes (439 individuals) were included. For DM diagnosis, the greatest AUC was 
      observed for OCT (0.82, 0.03). For DR detection, the greatest AUC was observed 
      for OCTA (0.77, 0.03), especially in the 3 × 3 mm superficial capillary plexus 
      OCTA scan (0.76, 0.04). For R-DR diagnosis, the greatest AUC was observed for 
      OCTA (0.87, 0.12) and the deep capillary plexus OCTA scan (0.86, 0.08). The 
      addition of clinical variables (age, sex, etc.) improved most models AUC for DM, 
      DR and R-DR diagnosis. The performance of the models was similar in unilateral 
      and bilateral eyes image datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics extracted from OCT and 
      OCTA images allow identification of patients with DM, DR, and R-DR using standard 
      ML classifiers. OCT was the best test for DM diagnosis, OCTA for DR and R-DR 
      diagnosis and the addition of clinical variables improved most models. This 
      pioneer study demonstrates that radiomics-based ML techniques applied to OCT and 
      OCTA images may be an option for DR screening in patients with type 1 DM.

TI  - Automated detection and differentiation of drusen, exudates, and cotton-wool 
      spots in digital color fundus photographs for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
PG  - 2260-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe and evaluate a machine learning-based, automated system to 
      detect exudates and cotton-wool spots in digital color fundus photographs and 
      differentiate them from drusen, for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. 
      METHODS: Three hundred retinal images from one eye of 300 patients with diabetes 
      were selected from a diabetic retinopathy telediagnosis database (nonmydriatic 
      camera, two-field photography): 100 with previously diagnosed bright lesions and 
      200 without. A machine learning computer program was developed that can identify 
      and differentiate among drusen, (hard) exudates, and cotton-wool spots. A human 
      expert standard for the 300 images was obtained by consensus annotation by two 
      retinal specialists. Sensitivities and specificities of the annotations on the 
      300 images by the automated system and a third retinal specialist were 
      determined. RESULTS: The system achieved an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.95 and sensitivity/specificity pairs of 0.95/0.88 
      for the detection of bright lesions of any type, and 0.95/0.86, 0.70/0.93, and 
      0.77/0.88 for the detection of exudates, cotton-wool spots, and drusen, 
      respectively. The third retinal specialist achieved pairs of 0.95/0.74 for bright 
      lesions and 0.90/0.98, 0.87/0.98, and 0.92/0.79 per lesion type. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      machine learning-based, automated system capable of detecting exudates and 
      cotton-wool spots and differentiating them from drusen in color images obtained 
      in community based diabetic patients has been developed and approaches the

      patients with diabetes.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe ocular complication of diabetes that can 
      lead to vision damage and even blindness. Currently, traditional deep 
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for DR grading tasks face two primary 
      challenges: (1) insensitivity to minority classes due to imbalanced data 
      distribution, and (2) neglecting the relationship between the left and right eyes 
      by utilizing the fundus image of only one eye for training without 
      differentiating between them. To tackle these challenges, we proposed the DRGCNN 
      (DR Grading CNN) model. To solve the problem caused by imbalanced data 
      distribution, our model adopts a more balanced strategy by allocating an equal 
      number of channels to feature maps representing various DR categories. 
      Furthermore, we introduce a CAM-EfficientNetV2-M encoder dedicated to encoding 
      input retinal fundus images for feature vector generation. The number of 
      parameters of our encoder is 52.88 M, which is less than RegNet_y_16gf (80.57 M) 
      and EfficientNetB7 (63.79 M), but the corresponding kappa value is higher. 
      Additionally, in order to take advantage of the binocular relationship, we input 
      fundus retinal images from both eyes of the patient into the network for features 
      fusion during the training phase. We achieved a kappa value of 86.62% on the 
      EyePACS dataset and 86.16% on the Messidor-2 dataset. Experimental results on 
      these representative datasets for diabetic retinopathy (DR) demonstrate the 
      exceptional performance of our DRGCNN model, establishing it as a highly 
      competitive intelligent classification model in the field of DR. The code is 
      available for use at https://github.com/Fat-Hai/DRGCNN.

AB  - Supervised machine learning is a powerful tool frequently used in computer-aided 
      diagnosis (CAD) applications. The bottleneck of this technique is its demand for 
      fine grained expert annotations, which are tedious for medical image analysis 
      applications. Furthermore, information is typically localized in diagnostic 
      images, which makes representation of an entire image by a single feature set 
      problematic. The multiple instance learning framework serves as a remedy to these 
      two problems by allowing labels to be provided for groups of observations, called 
      bags, and assuming the group label to be the maximum of the instance labels 
      within the bag. This setup can effectively be applied to CAD by splitting a given 
      diagnostic image into a Cartesian grid, treating each grid element (patch) as an 
      instance by representing it with a feature set, and grouping instances belonging 
      to the same image into a bag. We quantify the power of existing multiple instance 
      learning methods by evaluating their performance on two distinct CAD 
      applications: (i) Barrett's cancer diagnosis and (ii) diabetic retinopathy 
      screening. In the experiments, mi-Graph appears as the best-performing method in 
      bag-level prediction (i.e. diagnosis) for both of these applications that have 
      drastically different visual characteristics. For instance-level prediction (i.e. 
      disease localization), mi-SVM ranks as the most accurate method.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of statistical and machine learning 
      approaches to determine the diabetic status of patients from optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCT-A) images. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      cross-sectional observational study based at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, 
      United Kingdom. OCT-A scans were sequentially selected from one eye of each of 
      182 patients who were either not diabetic, diabetic without retinopathy, or 
      diabetic with retinopathy requiring hospital follow-up. Eligible images were 
      analyzed by expert purpose-built automated algorithms to calculate clinically 
      relevant outcome measures. These were used in turn as inputs to machine learning 
      and statistical procedures to derive algorithms to perform clinically relevant 
      classifications of patient images into the clinical groups. Receiver operating 
      characteristic curves for the classifiers were evaluated and predictive accuracy 
      assessed using area under curve (AUC). RESULTS: For distinguishing diabetic 
      patients from those without diabetes, the Random Forest classifier provided the 
      highest AUC (0.8). For distinguishing diabetic patients with significant 
      retinopathy from those with no retinopathy, the highest AUC was represented by 
      logistic regression (0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of 
      novel techniques using automated analysis of OCT-A scans to diagnose patients 
      with diabetes, or when diabetic status is known, to automatically determine those 
      that require hospital input. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This work advances the 
      concept of a rapid and noninvasive clinical screening tool using OCT-A to 
      determine a patient's diabetic status.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can deliver enhanced diagnosis 
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study evaluated a deep learning (DL) 
      algorithm for automatic DR severity assessment using high-resolution and 
      ultra-widefield (UWF) OCTA. Diabetic patients were examined with 6×6 mm2 
      high-resolution OCTA and 15×15 mm2 UWF-OCTA using PLEX®Elite 9000. A novel DL 
      algorithm was trained for automatic DR severity inference using both OCTA 
      acquisitions. The algorithm employed a unique hybrid fusion framework, 
      integrating structural and flow information from both acquisitions. It was 
      trained on data from 875 eyes of 444 patients. Tested on 53 patients (97 eyes), 
      the algorithm achieved a good area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AUC) for detecting DR (0.8868), moderate non-proliferative DR (0.8276), 
      severe non-proliferative DR (0.8376), and proliferative/treated DR (0.9070). 
      These results significantly outperformed detection with the 6×6 mm2 (AUC = 
      0.8462, 0.7793, 0.7889, and 0.8104, respectively) or 15×15 mm2 (AUC = 0.8251, 
      0.7745, 0.7967, and 0.8786, respectively) acquisitions alone. Thus, combining 
      high-resolution and UWF-OCTA acquisitions holds the potential for improved early 
      and late-stage DR detection, offering a foundation for enhancing DR management 
      and a clear path for future works involving expanded datasets and integrating 
      additional imaging modalities.

TI  - Machine Learning for Screening Microvascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetic 
      Patients Using Demographic, Clinical, and Laboratory Profiles.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11040903 [doi]
LID - 903
AB  - Microvascular complications are one of the key causes of mortality among type 2 
      diabetic patients. This study was sought to investigate the use of a novel 
      machine learning approach for predicting these complications using only the 
      patient demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles. A total of 96 Bangladeshi 
      participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited during their routine hospital 
      visits. All patient profiles were assessed by using a chi-squared (χ(2)) test to 
      statistically determine the most important markers in predicting three 
      microvascular complications: cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), diabetic 
      peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and diabetic retinopathy (RET). A machine learning 
      approach based on logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector 
      machine (SVM) algorithms was then developed to ensure automated clinical testing 
      for microvascular complications in diabetic patients. The highest prediction 
      accuracies were obtained by RF using diastolic blood pressure, albumin-creatinine 
      ratio, and gender for CAN testing (98.67%); microalbuminuria, smoking history, 
      and hemoglobin A1C for DPN testing (67.78%); and hemoglobin A1C, 
      microalbuminuria, and smoking history for RET testing (84.38%). This study 
      suggests machine learning as a promising automated tool for predicting 
      microvascular complications in diabetic patients using their profiles, which 
      could help prevent those patients from further microvascular complications 
      leading to early death.

AB  - Technological developments in ophthalmic imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) 
      create new possibilities for diagnostics in eye care. AI has already been applied 
      in ophthalmic diabetes care. AI-systems currently detect diabetic retinopathy in 
      general practice with a high sensitivity and specificity. AI-systems for the 
      screening, monitoring and treatment of age-related macular degeneration and 
      glaucoma are promising and are still being developed. AI-algorithms, however, 
      only perform tasks for which they have been specifically trained and highly 
      depend on the data and reference-standard that were used to train the system in 
      identifying a certain abnormality or disease. How the data and the gold standard 
      were established and determined, influences the performance of the algorithm. 
      Furthermore, interpretability of deep learning algorithms is still an ongoing 
      issue. By highlighting on images the areas that were critical for the decision of 
      the algorithm, users can gain more insight into how algorithms come to a 
      particular result.

TI  - A MULTITASK DEEP-LEARNING SYSTEM FOR ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC MACULAR ISCHEMIA ON 
      OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY IMAGES.
PG  - 184-194
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000003287 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to develop and test a deep-learning system to perform image 
      quality and diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) assessment on optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA) images. METHODS: This study included 7,194 OCTA 
      images with diabetes mellitus for training and primary validation and 960 images 
      from three independent data sets for external testing. A trinary classification 
      for image quality assessment and the presence or absence of DMI for DMI 
      assessment were labeled on all OCTA images. Two DenseNet-161 models were built 
      for both tasks for OCTA images of superficial and deep capillary plexuses, 
      respectively. External testing was performed on three unseen data sets in which 
      one data set using the same model of OCTA device as of the primary data set and 
      two data sets using another brand of OCTA device. We assessed the performance by 
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves with 
      sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies and the area under the 
      precision-recall curves with precision. RESULTS: For the image quality 
      assessment, analyses for gradability and measurability assessment were performed. 
      Our deep-learning system achieved the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves >0.948 and area under the precision-recall curves >0.866 
      for the gradability assessment, area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curves >0.960 and area under the precision-recall curves >0.822 for the 
      measurability assessment, and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curves >0.939 and area under the precision-recall curves >0.899 for the DMI 
      assessment across three external validation data sets. Grad-CAM demonstrated the 
      capability of our deep-learning system paying attention to regions related to DMI 
      identification. CONCLUSION: Our proposed multitask deep-learning system might 
      facilitate the development of a simplified assessment of DMI on OCTA images among 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus at high risk for visual loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the clinical 
      implementation phase, although real-world performance of deep-learning systems 
      (DLSs) for screening fundus disease remains unsatisfactory. Our study aimed to 
      train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the 
      real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected 
      prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted. 
      METHODS: In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the 
      Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common 
      retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 
      clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally 
      validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs 
      prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might 
      be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 
      physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with 
      that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese 
      ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed. FINDINGS: The area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal 
      validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 
      0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 
      0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was 
      similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were 
      observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying 
      experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested 
      using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957-0·964 in referable 
      diabetic retinopathy). INTERPRETATION: Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory 
      performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings 
      using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system 
      to be implemented and adopted for clinical care. FUNDING: This study was funded 
      by the National Key R&D Programme of China, the Science and Technology Planning 
      Projects of Guangdong Province, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, 
      the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the Fundamental 
      Research Funds for the Central Universities. TRANSLATION: For the Chinese

AB  - Many works have employed Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the detection of 
      Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a disease that affects the human eye. However, the 
      accuracy of most DR detection methods still need improvement. Gray Wolf 
      Optimization-Extreme Learning Machine (GWO-ELM) is one of the most popular ML 
      algorithms, and can be considered as an accurate algorithm in the process of 
      classification, but has not been used in solving DR detection. Therefore, this 
      work aims to apply the GWO-ELM classifier and employ one of the most popular 
      features extractions, Histogram of Oriented Gradients-Principal Component 
      Analysis (HOG-PCA), to increase the accuracy of DR detection system. Although the 
      HOG-PCA has been tested in many image processing domains including medical 
      domains, it has not yet been tested in DR. The GWO-ELM can prevent overfitting, 
      solve multi and binary classifications problems, and it performs like a 
      kernel-based Support Vector Machine with a Neural Network structure, whilst the 
      HOG-PCA has the ability to extract the most relevant features with low 
      dimensionality. Therefore, the combination of the GWO-ELM classifier and HOG-PCA 
      features might produce an effective technique for DR classification and features 
      extraction. The proposed GWO-ELM is evaluated based on two different datasets, 
      namely APTOS-2019 and Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD), in both 
      binary and multi-class classification. The experiment results have shown an 
      excellent performance of the proposed GWO-ELM model where it achieved an accuracy 
      of 96.21% for multi-class and 99.47% for binary using APTOS-2019 dataset as well 
      as 96.15% for multi-class and 99.04% for binary using IDRiD dataset. This 
      demonstrates that the combination of the GWO-ELM and HOG-PCA is an effective 
      classifier for detecting DR and might be applicable in solving other image data 
      types.

AB  - Diabetes problems can lead to a condition called diabetic retinopathy (DR), which 
      permanently damages the blood vessels in the retina. If not treated, DR is a 
      significant cause of blindness. The only DR treatments currently accessible are 
      those that block or delay vision loss, which emphasizes the value of routine 
      scanning with high-efficiency computer-based technologies to identify patients 
      early. The major goal of this study is to employ a deep learning neural network 
      to identify diabetic retinopathy in the retina's blood vessels. The NN classifier 
      is put to the test using the input fundus image and DR database. It effectively 
      contrasts retinal images and distinguishes between classes when there is a 
      legitimate edge. For the resolution of the problems in the photographs, it is 
      particularly useful. Here, it will be tested to see if the classification of 
      diabetic retinopathy is normal or abnormal. Modifying the existing study's 
      conclusion strategy, existing diabetic retinopathy techniques have sensitivity, 
      specificity, and accuracy levels that are much lower than what is required for 
      this research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness 
      worldwide, diabetes-related blindness can be prevented through effective 
      screening, detection, and treatment of disease. The study goal was to develop 
      risk stratification algorithms for the onset of retinal complications of 
      diabetes, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy, referable retinopathy, 
      and macular edema. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of 
      patients from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry who had 
      no evidence of diabetic retinopathy at a baseline diabetic retinopathy screening 
      during 2008-2020 was performed. Machine learning and logistic regression 
      prediction models for onset of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic 
      macular edema, and referable retinopathy detected through routine screening were 
      trained and internally validated. Model performance was assessed using area under 
      the curve (AUC) metrics. RESULTS: The study cohort (N = 276,794) was 51.9% male 
      and 42.1% White. Mean (±SD) age at baseline was 60.0 (±13.1) years. A machine 
      learning XGBoost algorithm was effective in identifying patients who developed 
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (AUC 0.86; 95% CI, 0.86-0.87), diabetic 
      macular edema (AUC 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.77), and referable retinopathy (AUC 0.78; 
      95% CI, 0.78-0.79). Similar results were found using a simpler nine-covariate 
      logistic regression model: proliferative diabetic retinopathy (AUC 0.82; 95% CI, 
      0.80-0.83), diabetic macular edema (AUC 0.73; 95% CI, 0.72-0.74), and referable 
      retinopathy (AUC 0.75; 95% CI, 0.75-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Relatively simple 
      logistic regression models using nine readily available clinical variables can be 
      used to rank order patients for onset of diabetic eye disease and thereby more 
      efficiently prioritize and target screening for at risk patients.

AB  - Current methods of evaluating the degree of diabetic retinopathy are highly 
      subjective and have no quantitative standard. To objectively evaluate the slight 
      changes in tissue structure during the early stage of retinal diseases, a 
      subjective interpretation and qualitative analysis of the pathological sections 
      of retinal HE in diabetic animals is required for screening and evaluating the 
      degree of diabetic retinopathy and drug efficacy. To develop an innovative method 
      for screening and evaluating the degree of diabetic retinopathy and drug 
      treatment based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Based on the change law of 
      the early nerve fiber layer and the ganglion cells, we get disparate 
      characteristics of the microscopic image of diabetes animal retina HE slices. 
      Using image recognition and deep learning methods on these HE slices, we can 
      identify the changes in the ganglion cells and nerve fiber layer for diagnosing 
      early retinopathy and evaluated the therapeutic effect of the potential drugs. We 
      conduct quantitative calculation per unit length of the nerve fiber layer and 
      total area of the nerve fiber layer to identify biology significance of edema. 
      Additionally, we also perform quantitative calculation with the number of unit 
      area ganglion cells to identify the section in biology cell hyperplasia. Finally, 
      we get the significance of quantitative calculation on the unit cell area to 
      identify ganglion cell shriveling in biology. In addition to the evaluation of 
      the disease degree and changes, we also obtained retinal HE sections after 
      different drug interventions and evaluated the therapeutic effect of the drugs. 
      This study presents a novel quantitative method for screening and evaluating of 
      diabetic retinopathy and drug efficacy.

AB  - The exponential increase in the number of diabetics around the world has led to 
      an equally large increase in the number of diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases which 
      is one of the major complications caused by diabetes. Left unattended, DR worsens 
      the vision and would lead to partial or complete blindness. As the number of 
      diabetics continue to increase exponentially in the coming years, the number of 
      qualified ophthalmologists need to increase in tandem in order to meet the demand 
      for screening of the growing number of diabetic patients. This makes it pertinent 
      to develop ways to automate the detection process of DR. A computer aided 
      diagnosis system has the potential to significantly reduce the burden currently 
      placed on the ophthalmologists. Hence, this review paper is presented with the 
      aim of summarizing, classifying, and analyzing all the recent development on 
      automated DR detection using fundus images from 2015 up to this date. Such work 
      offers an unprecedentedly thorough review of all the recent works on DR, which 
      will potentially increase the understanding of all the recent studies on 
      automated DR detection, particularly on those that deploys machine learning 
      algorithms. Firstly, in this paper, a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of 
      the methods that have been introduced in the detection of DR is presented, with a 
      focus on machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and 
      artificial neural networks (ANN) and various hybrid models. Each AI will then be 
      classified according to its type (e.g. CNN, ANN, SVM), its specific task(s) in 
      performing DR detection. In particular, the models that deploy CNN will be

AB  - BACKGROUND: To comprehend the complexities of pathophysiological mechanisms and 
      molecular events that contribute to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and 
      evaluate the diagnostic value of aqueous humor (AH) in monitoring the onset of 
      PDR. METHODS: A cohort containing 16 PDR and 10 cataract patients and another 
      validation cohort containing 8 PDR and 4 cataract patients were studied. AH was 
      collected and subjected to proteomics analyses. Bioinformatics analysis and a 
      machine learning-based pipeline called inference of biomolecular combinations 
      with minimal bias were used to explore the functional relevance, hub proteins, 
      and biomarkers. RESULTS: Deep profiling of AH proteomes revealed several 
      insights. First, the combination of SIAE, SEMA7A, GNS, and IGKV3D-15 and the 
      combination of ATP6AP1, SPARCL1, and SERPINA7 could serve as surrogate protein 
      biomarkers for monitoring PDR progression. Second, ALB, FN1, ACTB, SERPINA1, C3, 
      and VTN acted as hub proteins in the profiling of AH proteomes. SERPINA1 was the 
      protein with the highest correlation coefficient not only for BCVA but also for 
      the duration of diabetes. Third, "Complement and coagulation cascades" was an 
      important pathway for PDR development. CONCLUSIONS: AH proteomics provides stable 
      and accurate biomarkers for early warning and diagnosis of PDR. This study 
      provides a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PDR and a rich 
      resource for optimizing PDR management.

TI  - Strategies to Tackle the Global Burden of Diabetic Retinopathy: From Epidemiology 
      to Artificial Intelligence.
PG  - 9-20
LID - 10.1159/000502387 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a global public health disease projected to affect 642 million adults 
      by 2040, with about 75% residing in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading 
      cause of blindness in working-aged adults. There are 3 broad strategic 
      imperatives to prevent blindness caused by DR. Primary prevention requires 
      preventing or delaying the onset of DR in those with diabetes by systems-level 
      lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity or dietary 
      modifications, pharmacological interventions for glycaemic and blood pressure 
      control, and systematic screening for the onset of DR. Secondary prevention 
      requires preventing the progression of DR in patients with DR by continuing 
      systemic risk factor control, regular screening to monitor for the progression of 
      mild DR to vision-threatening stages, and the development and implementation of 
      evidence-based guidelines for managing DR. In this aspect, telemedicine-based DR 
      screening incorporating artificial intelligence technology has the potential to 
      facilitate more widespread and cost-effective screening, particularly in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Tertiary prevention of DR blindness has been the main 
      focus of the clinical ophthalmology community, classically based on laser 
      photocoagulation treatment and ocular surgery but with an increasing use of 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for vision-threatening DR. 
      Evidence from serial epidemiological studies shows blindness due to DR has 
      declined in high-income countries (e.g., the USA and UK) due to coordinated 
      public health education efforts, increased awareness, early detection by DR 
      screening, sustained systemic risk factor control, and the availability of 
      effective tertiary level treatment. However, the progress made in reducing DR 
      blindness in high-income countries may be overwhelmed by the increasing numbers 
      of patients with diabetes and DR in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., 
      China, India, Indonesia, etc.). Thus, to tackle DR at a global level, a paradigm 
      shift in strategic focus from tertiary towards secondary and primary prevention 
      measures with a multi-pronged whole-of-society approach at regional and national 
      levels is urgently needed.

AB  - People with diabetes are at risk of developing an eye disease called diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage 
      to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a 
      promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the 
      great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not 
      achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to 
      the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To 
      address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset 
      containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with 
      pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level 
      labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater 
      consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. 
      Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion 
      segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer 
      learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive 
      transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments 
      using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, 
      which can serve as baselines for future research. Our dataset will be released in 
      https://csyizhou.github.io/FGADR/.

      Performance and Impact of Stratification.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12041408 [doi]
LID - 1408
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the MONA.health artificial intelligence screening software for 
      detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), 
      including subgroup analysis. METHODS: The algorithm's threshold value was fixed 
      at the 90% sensitivity operating point on the receiver operating curve to perform 
      the disease classification. Diagnostic performance was appraised on a private 
      test set and publicly available datasets. Stratification analysis was executed on 
      the private test set considering age, ethnicity, sex, insulin dependency, year of 
      examination, camera type, image quality, and dilatation status. RESULTS: The 
      software displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 97.28% for DR and 98.08% for 
      DME on the private test set. The specificity and sensitivity for combined DR and 
      DME predictions were 94.24 and 90.91%, respectively. The AUC ranged from 96.91 to 
      97.99% on the publicly available datasets for DR. AUC values were above 95% in 
      all subgroups, with lower predictive values found for individuals above the age 
      of 65 (82.51% sensitivity) and Caucasians (84.03% sensitivity). CONCLUSION: We 
      report good overall performance of the MONA.health screening software for DR and 
      DME. The software performance remains stable with no significant deterioration of 
      the deep learning models in any studied strata.

TI  - Automated grading of diabetic retinopathy using CNN with hierarchical clustering

PG  - 623-635
LID - 10.1007/s13246-022-01129-z [doi]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a progressive vascular complication that affects 
      people who have diabetes. This retinal abnormality can cause irreversible vision 
      loss or permanent blindness; therefore, it is crucial to undergo frequent eye 
      screening for early recognition and treatment. This paper proposes a feature 
      extraction algorithm using discriminative multi-sized patches, based on deep 
      learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for DR grading. This comprehensive 
      algorithm extracts local and global features for efficient decision-making. Each 
      input image is divided into small-sized patches to extract local-level features 
      and then split into clusters or subsets. Hierarchical clustering by Siamese 
      network with pre-trained CNN is proposed in this paper to select clusters with 
      more discriminative patches. The fine-tuned Xception model of CNN is used to 
      extract the global-level features of larger image patches. Local and global 
      features are combined to improve the overall image-wise classification accuracy. 
      The final support vector machine classifier exhibits 96% of classification 
      accuracy with tenfold cross-validation in classifying DR images.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal change in 
      quantitative ultrawide-field angiographic (UWFA) parameters and correlate them 
      with functional outcomes and spectral domain-OCT metrics. DESIGN: This study is a 
      post hoc analysis of the phase II RUBY study: a prospective, randomized trial of 
      patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with either intravitreal 
      aflibercept injection (IAI) or combined IAI/nesvacumab (antiangiopoietin 2 mAb). 
      SUBJECTS: Subjects with DME that underwent UWFA across all treatment groups (n = 
      44). METHODS: A machine learning-enabled feature extraction system generated 
      panretinal quantitative UWFA metrics, including leakage, ischemia, and 
      microaneurysm (MA) burden. Zonal assessments were performed corresponding to the 
      macula, midperiphery, and far periphery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in 
      ischemic area and index (proportion of nonperfusion in analyzable retina), 
      leakage area and index (proportion of leakage in analyzable retina), and MA count 
      at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36 were analyzed. Spectral-domain-OCT 
      quantitative metrics, such as central subfield thickness, ellipsoid zone (EZ) 
      integrity parameters, intraretinal fluid (IRF) volume, and subretinal fluid (SRF) 
      volume were extracted via a machine learning-enhanced OCT feature extraction 
      platform and analyzed. Additionally, the effect of these changes on 
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean panretinal 
      leakage index, zonal leakage area, and panretinal MA count improved significantly 
      between baseline and week 36. Panretinal ischemic index decreased between 
      baseline and week 36, with some aspects showing significant improvement. Mean 
      BCVA significantly improved from baseline to week 36. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between change in BCVA and change in macular leakage area. A 
      direct correlation was observed between both baseline macular leakage area and 
      panretinal leakage index with IRF volume, SRF volume, and EZ disruption on OCT. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of UWFA parameters demonstrates a significant improvement 
      in panretinal leakage index, leakage area, and MA burden in eyes treated with IAI 
      with or without nesvacumab. A numeric reduction in panretinal ischemic index and 
      area was noted. The analysis also shows the critical association of leakage with 
      visual and OCT features. This highlights the potential role of UWFA in disease 
      burden assessment, with leakage parameters serving as a primary end point.

TI  - Machine Learning Can Predict Anti-VEGF Treatment Demand in a Treat-and-Extend 
      Regimen for Patients with Neovascular AMD, DME, and RVO Associated Macular Edema.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the potential of machine learning to predict low and high 
      treatment demand in real life in patients with neovascular age-related macular 
      degeneration (nAMD), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and diabetic macular edema 
      (DME) treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen (TER). DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred seventy-seven eyes (340 
      patients) with nAMD and 333 eyes (285 patients) with RVO or DME treated with 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (VEGF) according to a predefined 
      TER from 2014 through 2018. METHODS: Eyes were grouped by disease into low, 
      moderate, and high treatment demands, defined by the average treatment interval 
      (low, ≥10 weeks; high, ≤5 weeks; moderate, remaining eyes). Two random forest 
      models were trained to predict the probability of the long-term treatment demand 
      of a new patient. Both models use morphological features automatically extracted 
      from the OCT volumes at baseline and after 2 consecutive visits, as well as 
      patient demographic information. Evaluation of the models included a 10-fold 
      cross-validation ensuring that no patient was present in both the training set 
      (nAMD, approximately 339; RVO and DME, approximately 300) and test set (nAMD, 
      approximately 38; RVO and DME, approximately 33). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of both models; 
      contribution to the prediction and statistical significance of the input 
      features. RESULTS: Based on the first 3 visits, it was possible to predict low 
      and high treatment demand in nAMD eyes and in RVO and DME eyes with similar 
      accuracy. The distribution of low, high, and moderate demanders was 127, 42, and 
      208, respectively, for nAMD and 61, 50, and 222, respectively, for RVO and DME. 
      The nAMD-trained models yielded mean AUCs of 0.79 and 0.79 over the 10-fold 
      crossovers for low and high demand, respectively. Models for RVO and DME showed 
      similar results, with a mean AUC of 0.76 and 0.78 for low and high demand, 
      respectively. Even more importantly, this study revealed that it is possible to 
      predict low demand reasonably well at the first visit, before the first 
      injection. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning classifiers can predict treatment demand 
      and may assist in establishing patient-specific treatment plans in the near 
      future.

      Retinopathy in India.
PG  - 987-993
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.2004 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: More than 60 million people in India have diabetes and are at risk 
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening disease. Automated 
      interpretation of retinal fundus photographs can help support and scale a robust 
      screening program to detect DR. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate the 
      performance of an automated DR system across 2 sites in India. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective observational study was conducted at 2 eye 
      care centers in India (Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya) and included 
      3049 patients with diabetes. Data collection and patient enrollment took place 
      between April 2016 and July 2016 at Aravind and May 2016 and April 2017 at 
      Sankara Nethralaya. The model was trained and fixed in March 2016. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Automated DR grading system compared with manual grading by 1 trained grader and 
      1 retina specialist from each site. Adjudication by a panel of 3 retinal 
      specialists served as the reference standard in the cases of disagreement. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity for moderate or worse DR or 
      referable diabetic macula edema. RESULTS: Of 3049 patients, 1091 (35.8%) were 
      women and the mean (SD) age for patients at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya was 
      56.6 (9.0) years and 56.0 (10.0) years, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, 
      the sensitivity and specificity for manual grading by individual nonadjudicator 
      graders ranged from 73.4% to 89.8% and from 83.5% to 98.7%, respectively. The 
      automated DR system's performance was equal to or exceeded manual grading, with 
      an 88.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 85.8-91.5), 92.2% specificity (95% CI, 90.3-93.8), 
      and an area under the curve of 0.963 on the data set from Aravind Eye Hospital 
      and 92.1% sensitivity (95% CI, 90.1-93.8), 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.2-96.1), 
      and an area under the curve of 0.980 on the data set from Sankara Nethralaya. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study shows that the automated DR system 
      generalizes to this population of Indian patients in a prospective setting and 
      demonstrates the feasibility of using an automated DR grading system to expand 
      screening programs.

TI  - Deep Learning Predicts OCT Measures of Diabetic Macular Thickening From Color 
      Fundus Photographs.
PG  - 852-857
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-25634 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop deep learning (DL) models for the automatic detection of 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures of diabetic macular thickening (MT) 
      from color fundus photographs (CFPs). METHODS: Retrospective analysis on 17,997 
      CFPs and their associated OCT measurements from the phase 3 RIDE/RISE diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) studies. DL with transfer-learning cascade was applied on 
      CFPs to predict time-domain OCT (TD-OCT)-equivalent measures of MT, including 
      central subfield thickness (CST) and central foveal thickness (CFT). MT was 
      defined by using two OCT cutoff points: 250 μm and 400 μm. A DL regression model 
      was developed to directly quantify the actual CFT and CST from CFPs. RESULTS: The 
      best DL model was able to predict CST ≥ 250 μm and CFT ≥ 250 μm with an area 
      under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.00) and 0.91 
      (95% CI, 0.76-0.99), respectively. To predict CST ≥ 400 μm and CFT ≥ 400 μm, the 
      best DL model had an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00) and 0.96 (95% CI, 
      0.88-1.00), respectively. The best deep convolutional neural network regression 
      model to quantify CST and CFT had an R2 of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49-0.91) and 0.54 (95% 
      CI, 0.20-0.87), respectively. The performance of the DL models declined when the 
      CFPs were of poor quality or contained laser scars. CONCLUSIONS: DL is capable of 
      predicting key quantitative TD-OCT measurements related to MT from CFPs. The DL 
      models presented here could enhance the efficiency of DME diagnosis in 
      tele-ophthalmology programs, promoting better visual outcomes. Future research is 
      needed to validate DL algorithms for MT in the real-world.

AB  - Neovascularization (NV) is a definitive indicator for the onset of Proliferative 
      Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). The new vessels are fragile and prone to bleed, 
      leading to high risk of sudden vision loss. Automatic detection of NV is an 
      important task in automatic Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening as a consequence 
      of the unmet requirement between the growing number of DR patients and limited 
      number of ophthalmologists. This paper focuses on the computer aided detection of 
      neovascularization in the optic disk region. We propose a novel image processing 
      approach that involves vessel segmentation using multi-level Gabor filtering, 
      feature extraction from vessel related features and texture features, and image 
      classification based on machine learning. 21 features were extracted from each 
      NVD image. The extracted features were trained and tested on 66 retinal images, 
      which contains 16 NVD and 50 normal images, and achieved an sensitivity of 15/16 
      and specificity of 47/50.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most prevalent cause of visual impairment in 
      adults worldwide. Typically, patients with DR do not show symptoms until later 
      stages, by which time it may be too late to receive effective treatment. DR 
      Grading is challenging because of the small size and variation in lesion 
      patterns. The key to fine-grained DR grading is to discover more discriminating 
      elements such as cotton wool, hard exudates, hemorrhages, microaneurysms etc. 
      Although deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNN) seem ideal 
      for the automated detection of abnormalities in advanced clinical imaging, 
      small-size lesions are very hard to distinguish by using traditional networks. 
      This work proposes a bi-directional spatial and channel-wise parallel attention 
      based network to learn discriminative features for diabetic retinopathy grading. 
      The proposed attention block plugged with a backbone network helps to extract 
      features specific to fine-grained DR-grading. This scheme boosts classification 
      performance along with the detection of small-sized lesion parts. Extensive 
      experiments are performed on four widely used benchmark datasets for DR grading, 
      and performance is evaluated on different quality metrics. Also, for model 
      interpretability, activation maps are generated using the LIME method to 
      visualize the predicted lesion parts. In comparison with state-of-the-art 
      methods, the proposed IDANet exhibits better performance for DR grading and 
      lesion detection.

AB  - Medical studies have shown that the condition of human retinal vessels may reveal 
      the physiological structure of the relationship between age-related macular 
      degeneration, glaucoma, atherosclerosis, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and 
      other ophthalmic diseases and systemic diseases, and their abnormal changes often 
      serve as a diagnostic basis for the severity of the condition. In this paper, we 
      design and implement a deep learning-based algorithm for automatic segmentation 
      of retinal vessel (CSP_UNet). It mainly adopts a U-shaped structure composed of 
      an encoder and a decoder and utilizes a cross-stage local connectivity mechanism, 
      attention mechanism, and multi-scale fusion, which can obtain better segmentation 
      results with limited data set capacity. The experimental results show that 
      compared with several existing classical algorithms, the proposed algorithm has 
      the highest blood vessel intersection ratio on the dataset composed of four 
      retinal fundus images, reaching 0.6674. Then, based on the CSP_UNet and 
      introducing hard parameter sharing in multi-task learning, we innovatively 
      propose a combined diagnosis algorithm vessel segmentation and diabetic 
      retinopathy for retinal images (MTNet). The experiments show that the diagnostic 
      accuracy of the MTNet algorithm is higher than that of the single task, with 0.4% 
      higher vessel segmentation IoU and 5.2% higher diagnostic accuracy of diabetic 
      retinopathy classification.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a human eye disease that affects people who are 
      suffering from diabetes. It causes damage to their eyes, including vision loss. 
      It is treatable; however, it takes a long time to diagnose and may require many 
      eye exams. Early detection of DR may prevent or delay the vision loss. Therefore, 
      a robust, automatic and computer-based diagnosis of DR is essential. Currently, 
      deep neural networks are being utilized in numerous medical areas to diagnose 
      various diseases. Consequently, deep transfer learning is utilized in this 
      article. We employ five convolutional-neural-network-based designs (AlexNet, 
      GoogleNet, Inception V4, Inception ResNet V2 and ResNeXt-50). A collection of DR 
      pictures is created. Subsequently, the created collections are labeled with an 
      appropriate treatment approach. This automates the diagnosis and assists patients 
      through subsequent therapies. Furthermore, in order to identify the severity of 
      DR retina pictures, we use our own dataset to train deep convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs). Experimental results reveal that the pre-trained model 
      Se-ResNeXt-50 obtains the best classification accuracy of 97.53% for our dataset 
      out of all pre-trained models. Moreover, we perform five different experiments on 
      each CNN architecture. As a result, a minimum accuracy of 84.01% is achieved for 
      a five-degree classification.

TI  - The Clinical Influence after Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network-Based 
      Software for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection in the Primary Care Setting.

AB  - Deep learning-based software is developed to assist physicians in terms of 
      diagnosis; however, its clinical application is still under investigation. We 
      integrated deep-learning-based software for diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading 
      into the clinical workflow of an endocrinology department where endocrinologists 
      grade for retinal images and evaluated the influence of its implementation. A 
      total of 1432 images from 716 patients and 1400 images from 700 patients were 
      collected before and after implementation, respectively. Using the grading by 
      ophthalmologists as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to detect referable 
      DR (RDR) were 0.91 (0.87-0.96), 0.90 (0.87-0.92), and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) at the 
      image level; and 0.91 (0.81-0.97), 0.84 (0.80-0.87), and 0.87 (0.83-0.91) at the 
      patient level. The monthly RDR rate dropped from 55.1% to 43.0% after 
      implementation. The monthly percentage of finishing grading within the allotted 
      time increased from 66.8% to 77.6%. There was a wide range of agreement values 
      between the software and endocrinologists after implementation (kappa values of 
      0.17-0.65). In conclusion, we observed the clinical influence of 
      deep-learning-based software on graders without the retinal subspecialty. 
      However, the validation using images from local datasets is recommended before 
      clinical implementation.

TI  - Deep Learning Frameworks for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Smartphone-based 
      Retinal Imaging Systems.
PG  - 409-417
LID - 10.1016/j.patrec.2020.04.009 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) may result in various degrees of vision loss and even 
      blindness if not diagnosed in a timely manner. Therefore, having an annual eye 
      exam helps early detection to prevent vision loss in earlier stages, especially 
      for diabetic patients. Recent technological advances made smartphone-based 
      retinal imaging systems available on the market to perform small-sized, 
      low-powered, and affordable DR screening in diverse environments. However, the 
      accuracy of DR detection depends on the field of view and image quality. Since 
      smartphone-based retinal imaging systems have much more compact designs than a 
      traditional fundus camera, captured images are likely to be the low quality with 
      a smaller field of view. Our motivation in this paper is to develop an automatic 
      DR detection model for smartphone-based retinal images using the deep learning 
      approach with the ResNet50 network. This study first utilized the well-known 
      AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 architectures, using the transfer learning 
      approach. Second, these frameworks were retrained with retina images from several 
      datasets including EyePACS, Messidor, IDRiD, and Messidor-2 to investigate the 
      effect of using images from the single, cross, and multiple datasets. Third, the 
      proposed ResNet50 model is applied to smartphone-based synthetic images to 
      explore the DR detection accuracy of smartphone-based retinal imaging systems. 
      Based on the vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy detection results, the 
      proposed approach achieved a high classification accuracy of 98.6%, with a 98.2% 
      sensitivity and a 99.1% specificity while its AUC was 0.9978 on the independent 
      test dataset. As the main contributions, DR detection accuracy was improved using 
      the deep transfer learning approach for the ResNet50 network with publicly 
      available datasets and the effect of the field of view in smartphone-based 
      retinal imaging was studied. Although a smaller number of images were used in the 
      training set compared with the existing studies, considerably acceptable high 
      accuracies for validation and testing data were obtained.

PG  - 1100-1118
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318106 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension remains the largest modifiable cause of mortality worldwide despite 
      the availability of effective medications and sustained research efforts over the 
      past 100 years. Hypertension requires transformative solutions that can help 
      reduce the global burden of the disease. Artificial intelligence and machine 
      learning, which have made a substantial impact on our everyday lives over the 
      last decade may be the route to this transformation. However, artificial 
      intelligence in health care is still in its nascent stages and realizing its 
      potential requires numerous challenges to be overcome. In this review, we provide 
      a clinician-centric perspective on artificial intelligence and machine learning 
      as applied to medicine and hypertension. We focus on the main roadblocks impeding 
      implementation of this technology in clinical care and describe efforts driving 
      potential solutions. At the juncture, there is a critical requirement for 
      clinical and scientific expertise to work in tandem with algorithmic innovation 
      followed by rigorous validation and scrutiny to realize the promise of artificial 
      intelligence-enabled health care for hypertension and other chronic diseases.

TI  - Cost-Utility Analysis of Deep Learning and Trained Human Graders for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Screening in a Nationwide Program.
PG  - 1339-1357
LID - 10.1007/s40123-023-00688-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep learning (DL) for screening diabetic retinopathy (DR) has the 
      potential to address limited healthcare resources by enabling expanded access to 
      healthcare. However, there is still limited health economic evaluation, 
      particularly in low- and middle-income countries, on this subject to aid 
      decision-making for DL adoption. METHODS: In the context of a middle-income 
      country (MIC), using Thailand as a model, we constructed a decision tree-Markov 
      hybrid model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes of Thailand's national DR 
      screening program via DL and trained human graders (HG). We calculated the 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the two strategies. 
      Sensitivity analyses were performed to probe the influence of modeling 
      parameters. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, screening with DL was 
      associated with a reduction in costs of ~ US$ 2.70, similar quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALY) of + 0.0043, and an incremental net monetary benefit of ~ US$ 
      24.10 in the base case. In sensitivity analysis, DL remained cost-effective even 
      with a price increase from US$ 1.00 to US$ 4.00 per patient at a Thai 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of ~ US$ 4.997 per QALY gained. When further 
      incorporating recent findings suggesting improved compliance to treatment 
      referral with DL, our analysis models effectiveness benefits of ~ US$ 20 to US$ 
      50 depending on compliance. CONCLUSION: DR screening using DL in an MIC using 
      Thailand as a model may result in societal cost-savings and similar health 
      outcomes compared with HG. This study may provide an economic rationale to expand 
      DL-based DR screening in MICs as an alternative solution for limited availability 
      of skilled human resources for primary screening, particularly in MICs with 
      similar prevalence of diabetes and low compliance to referrals for treatment.

TI  - The Utility of Smartphone-Based Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy: A Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 219-226
LID - 10.4103/2452-2325.329064 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy measures such as sensitivity and 
      specificity of smartphone-based artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the 
      detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: A literature search of the 
      EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (up to March 2020) was conducted. Only studies using 
      both smartphone-based cameras and AI software for image analysis were included. 
      The main outcome measures were pooled sensitivity and specificity, diagnostic 
      odds ratios and relative risk of smartphone-based AI approaches in detecting DR 
      (of all types), and referable DR (RDR) (moderate nonproliferative retinopathy or 
      worse and/or the presence of diabetic macular edema). RESULTS: Smartphone-based 
      AI has a pooled sensitivity of 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.3%-94.0%) 
      and pooled specificity of 92.4% (95% CI: 86.4%-95.9%) in detecting DR. For 
      referable disease, sensitivity is 97.9% (95% CI: 92.6%-99.4%), and the pooled 
      specificity is 85.9% (95% CI: 76.5%-91.9%). The technology is better at correctly 
      identifying referable retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The smartphone-based AI programs 
      demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of DR and RDR and are 
      potentially viable substitutes for conventional diabetic screening approaches. 
      Further, high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to establish the 
      effectiveness of this approach in different populations.

TI  - Automated Quantification of Photoreceptor alteration in macular disease using 
      Optical Coherence Tomography and Deep Learning.
PG  - 5619

AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) and retina vein occlusion (RVO) are macular diseases 
      in which central photoreceptors are affected due to pathological accumulation of 
      fluid. Optical coherence tomography allows to visually assess and evaluate 
      photoreceptor integrity, whose alteration has been observed as an important 
      biomarker of both diseases. However, the manual quantification of this layered 
      structure is challenging, tedious and time-consuming. In this paper we introduce 
      a deep learning approach for automatically segmenting and characterising 
      photoreceptor alteration. The photoreceptor layer is segmented using an ensemble 
      of four different convolutional neural networks. En-face representations of the 
      layer thickness are produced to characterize the photoreceptors. The pixel-wise 
      standard deviation of the score maps produced by the individual models is also 
      taken to indicate areas of photoreceptor abnormality or ambiguous results. 
      Experimental results showed that our ensemble is able to produce results in pair 
      with a human expert, outperforming each of its constitutive models. No 
      statistically significant differences were observed between mean thickness 
      estimates obtained from automated and manually generated annotations. Therefore, 
      our model is able to reliable quantify photoreceptors, which can be used to 
      improve prognosis and managment of macular diseases.

AB  - Recent advances in machine learning models have greatly increased the performance 
      of automated methods in medical image analysis. However, the internal functioning 
      of such models is largely hidden, which hinders their integration in clinical 
      practice. Explainability and trust are viewed as important aspects of modern 
      methods, for the latter's widespread use in clinical communities. As such, 
      validation of machine learning models represents an important aspect and yet, 
      most methods are only validated in a limited way. In this work, we focus on 
      providing a richer and more appropriate validation approach for highly powerful 
      Visual Question Answering (VQA) algorithms. To better understand the performance 
      of these methods, which answer arbitrary questions related to images, this work 
      focuses on an automatic visual Turing test (VTT). That is, we propose an 
      automatic adaptive questioning method, that aims to expose the reasoning behavior 
      of a VQA algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) 
      agent that observes the history of previously asked questions, and uses it to 
      select the next question to pose. We demonstrate our approach in the context of 
      evaluating algorithms that automatically answer questions related to diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) grading. The experiments show that such an agent has similar 
      behavior to a clinician, whereby asking questions that are relevant to key 
      clinical concepts.

AB  - Over the past few decades, health care industries and medical practitioners faced 
      a lot of obstacles to diagnosing medical-related problems due to inadequate 
      technology and availability of equipment. In the present era, computer science 
      technologies such as IoT, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and its allied 
      techniques, etc. play a crucial role in the identification of medical diseases, 
      especially in the domain of Ophthalmology. Despite this, ophthalmologists have to 
      perform the various disease diagnosis task manually which is time-consuming and 
      the chances of error are also very high because some of the abnormalities of eye 
      diseases possess the same symptoms. Furthermore, multiple autonomous systems also 
      exist to categorize the diseases but their prediction rate does not accomplish 
      state-of-art accuracy. In the proposed approach by implementing the concept of 
      Attention, Transfer Learning with the Deep Convolution Neural Network, the model 
      accomplished an accuracy of 97.79% and 95.6% on the training and testing data 
      respectively. This autonomous model efficiently classifies the various oscular 
      disorders namely Choroidal Neovascularization, Diabetic Macular Edema, Drusen 
      from the Optical Coherence Tomography images. It may provide a realistic solution 
      to the healthcare sector to bring down the ophthalmologist burden in the 
      screening of Diabetic Retinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present and validate a deep ensemble algorithm to detect diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) using retinal fundus images. 
      METHODS: A total of 8739 retinal fundus images were collected from a 
      retrospective cohort of 3285 patients. For detecting DR and DMO, a multiple 
      improved Inception-v4 ensembling approach was developed. We measured the 
      algorithm's performance and made a comparison with that of human experts on our 
      primary dataset, while its generalization was assessed on the publicly available 
      Messidor-2 dataset. Also, we investigated systematically the impact of the size 
      and number of input images used in training on model's performance, respectively. 
      Further, the time budget of training/inference versus model performance was 
      analyzed. RESULTS: On our primary test dataset, the model achieved an 0.992 (95% 
      CI, 0.989-0.995) AUC corresponding to 0.925 (95% CI, 0.916-0.936) sensitivity and 
      0.961 (95% CI, 0.950-0.972) specificity for referable DR, while the sensitivity 
      and specificity for ophthalmologists ranged from 0.845 to 0.936, and from 0.912 
      to 0.971, respectively. For referable DMO, our model generated an AUC of 0.994 
      (95% CI, 0.992-0.996) with a 0.930 (95% CI, 0.919-0.941) sensitivity and 0.971 
      (95% CI, 0.965-0.978) specificity, whereas ophthalmologists obtained 
      sensitivities ranging between 0.852 and 0.946, and specificities ranging between 
      0.926 and 0.985. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the deep ensemble model 
      exhibited excellent performance in detecting DR and DMO, and had good robustness 
      and generalization, which could potentially help support and expand DR/DMO 
      screening programs.

AB  - Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness, affecting over 
      93 million people. An automated clinical retinal screening process would be 
      highly beneficial and provide a valuable second opinion for doctors worldwide. A 
      computer-aided system to detect and grade the retinal images would enhance the 
      workflow of endocrinologists. Approach: For this research, we make use of a 
      publicly available dataset comprised of 3662 images. We present a hybrid machine 
      learning architecture to detect and grade the level of diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      severity. We also present and compare simple transfer learning-based approaches 
      using established networks such as AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, Inception-v3, NASNet, 
      DenseNet, and GoogLeNet for DR detection. For the grading stage (mild, moderate, 
      proliferative, or severe), we present an approach of combining various 
      convolutional neural networks with principal component analysis for 
      dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine classifier. We study the 
      performance of these networks under different preprocessing conditions. Results: 
      We compare these results with various existing state-of-the-art approaches, which 
      include single-stage architectures. We demonstrate that this architecture is more 
      robust to limited training data and class imbalance. We achieve an accuracy of 
      98.4% for DR detection and an accuracy of 96.3% for distinguishing severity of 
      DR, thereby setting a benchmark for future research efforts using a limited set 
      of training images. Conclusions: Results obtained using the proposed approach 
      serve as a benchmark for future research efforts. We demonstrate as a 
      proof-of-concept that an automated detection and grading system could be 
      developed with a limited set of images and labels. This type of independent 
      architecture for detection and grading could be used in areas with a scarcity of 
      trained clinicians based on the necessity.

AB  - The present study proposes a new approach to automated screening of Clinically 
      Significant Macular Edema (CSME) and addresses two major challenges associated 
      with such screenings, i.e., exudate segmentation and imbalanced datasets. The 
      proposed approach replaces the conventional exudate segmentation based feature 
      extraction by combining a pre-trained deep neural network with meta-heuristic 
      feature selection. A feature space over-sampling technique is being used to 
      overcome the effects of skewed datasets and the screening is accomplished by a 
      k-NN based classifier. The role of each data-processing step (e.g., class 
      balancing, feature selection) and the effects of limiting the region of interest 
      to fovea on the classification performance are critically analyzed. Finally, the 
      selection and implication of operating points on Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic curve are discussed. The results of this study convincingly 
      demonstrate that by following these fundamental practices of machine learning, a 
      basic k-NN based classifier could effectively accomplish the CSME screening.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report longitudinal trends of quantitative ultrawidefield 
      fluorescein angiography (qUWFA) biomarkers in the Intravitreal Aflibercept as 
      Indicated by Real-Time Objective Imaging to Achieve Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Improvement (PRIME) diabetic retinopathy (DR) clinical trial. DESIGN: Post hoc 
      analysis of the PRIME prospective randomized DR clinical trial comparing 
      intravitreal aflibercept treatment based on the DR severity score (DRSS) or 
      quantitative leakage index for DR improvement (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT03531294). PARTICIPANTS: Patients were enrolled with a DRSS level of 47A to 
      71A and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/800 or better. Key exclusion criteria 
      were previous intravitreal injection, panretinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, 
      central-involving macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage. METHODS: A previously 
      validated, machine learning-based qUWFA analysis platform was used for panretinal 
      leakage index assessment and differentiation of generalized and perivascular 
      leakage phenotypes. Additionally, microaneurysm count and ischemic index were 
      quantified in panretinal and macular regions. The trends in these biomarkers and 
      therapeutic response were studied over 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Longitudinal trends of qUWFA biomarkers. The impact of these qUWFA metrics on 
      treatment response was assessed by studying their associations with time to 
      2-step DRSS improvement and number of treatment-free days. RESULTS: Forty eyes 
      from 40 subjects with DR were enrolled. Lower baseline generalized leakage was 
      noted in eyes that attained the 2-step DRSS improvement in < 16 weeks (1.9% vs. 
      2.8%; P = 0.026). Baseline macular perivascular-generalized leakage ratio had a 
      significant correlation with the number of treatment-free days (r = 0.4; P = 
      0.012). At the end of 1 year, therapy significantly reduced the mean panretinal 
      (3.9% vs. 5.8%; P = 0.002) and macular (6.2% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.008) generalized 
      leakage indices compared with baseline, as well as the mean panretinal 
      perivascular leakage index (1.5% vs. 2.3%; P = 0.002). The mean panretinal 
      ischemic index demonstrated a small but likely clinically insignificant decrease 
      from 12.5% at baseline to 11.6% at year 1 (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Down-trending 
      leakage indices and microaneurysm counts were demonstrated over 1 year of 
      anti-VEGF therapy. At baseline, DR eyes with lower generalized leakage responded 
      to therapy more rapidly. Eyes with greater perivascular leakage relative to 
      generalized leakage showed a longer-lasting anti-VEGF treatment response.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision impairment in 
      working-age adults. Automated screening can increase DR detection at early stages 
      at relatively low costs. We developed and evaluated a cloud-based screening tool 
      that uses artificial intelligence (AI), the LuxIA algorithm, to detect DR from a 
      single fundus image. METHODS: Color fundus images that were previously graded by 
      expert readers were collected from the Canarian Health Service (Retisalud) and 
      used to train LuxIA, a deep-learning-based algorithm for the detection of more 
      than mild DR. The algorithm was deployed in the Discovery cloud platform to 
      evaluate each test set. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve were computed using a bootstrapping 
      method to evaluate the algorithm performance and compared through different 
      publicly available datasets. A usability test was performed to assess the 
      integration into a clinical tool. RESULTS: Three separate datasets, Messidor-2, 
      APTOS, and a holdout set from Retisalud were evaluated. Mean sensitivity and 
      specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reached for these three datasets 
      were 0.901 (0.901-0.902) and 0.955 (0.955-0.956), 0.995 (0.995-0.995) and 0.821 
      (0.821-0.823), and 0.911 (0.907-0.912) and 0.880 (0.879-0.880), respectively. The 
      usability test confirmed the successful integration of LuxIA into Discovery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data were used to train the deep-learning-based algorithm 
      LuxIA to an expert-level performance. The whole process (image uploading and 
      analysis) was integrated into the cloud-based platform Discovery, allowing more 
      patients to have access to expert-level screening tools. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: 
      Using the cloud-based LuxIA tool as part of a screening program may give diabetic 
      patients greater access to specialist-level decisions, without the need for 
      consultation.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects the retina and causes vision 
      loss due to blood vessel destruction. The retina is the layer of the eye 
      responsible for visual processing and nerve signaling. Diabetic retinopathy 
      causes vision loss, floaters, and sometimes blindness; however, it often shows no 
      warning signals in the early stages. Deep learning-based techniques have emerged 
      as viable options for automated illness classification as large-scale medical 
      imaging datasets have become more widely available. To adapt to medical image 
      analysis tasks, transfer learning makes use of pre-trained models to extract 
      high-level characteristics from natural images. In this research, an intelligent 
      recommendation-based fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model has been proposed for quick 
      and precise assessment for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy from fundus 
      images, which will help ophthalmologists in early diagnosis and detection. The 
      proposed EfficientNetB0 model is compared with three transfer learning-based 
      models, namely, ResNet152, VGG16, and DenseNet169. The experimental work is 
      carried out using publicly available datasets from Kaggle consisting of 3,200 
      fundus images. Out of all the transfer learning models, the EfficientNetB0 model 
      has outperformed with an accuracy of 0.91, followed by DenseNet169 with an 
      accuracy of 0.90. In comparison to other approaches, the proposed intelligent 
      recommendation-based fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 approach delivers state-of-the-art 
      performance on the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score criteria. The system 
      aims to assist ophthalmologists in early detection, potentially alleviating the 
      burden on healthcare units.

AB  - Although for many diseases there is a progressive diagnosis scale, automatic 
      analysis of grade-based medical images is quite often addressed as a binary 
      classification problem, missing the finer distinction and intrinsic relation 
      between the different possible stages or grades. Ordinal regression (or 
      classification) considers the order of the values of the categorical labels and 
      thus takes into account the order of grading scales used to assess the severity 
      of different medical conditions. This paper presents a quantum-inspired deep 
      probabilistic learning ordinal regression model for medical image diagnosis that 
      takes advantage of the representational power of deep learning and the intrinsic 
      ordinal information of disease stages. The method is evaluated on two different 
      medical image analysis tasks: prostate cancer diagnosis and diabetic retinopathy 
      grade estimation on eye fundus images. The experimental results show that the 
      proposed method not only improves the diagnosis performance on the two tasks but 
      also the interpretability of the results by quantifying the uncertainty of the 
      predictions in comparison to conventional deep classification and regression 
      architectures. The code and datasets are available at 
      https://github.com/stoledoc/DQOR.

AB  - As one of the most common diabetic complications, diabetic retinopathy (DR) can 
      cause retinal damage, vision loss and even blindness. Automated DR grading 
      technology has important clinical significance, which can help ophthalmologists 
      achieve rapid and early diagnosis. With the popularity of deep learning, DR 
      grading based on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has become the 
      mainstream method. Unfortunately, although the CNN-based method can achieve 
      satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, it lacks significant clinical information. In 
      this paper, a lesion-attention pyramid network (LAPN) is presented. The pyramid 
      network integrates the subnetworks with different resolutions to get multi-scale 
      features. In order to take the lesion regions in the high-resolution image as the 
      diagnostic evidence, the low-resolution network calculates the lesion activation 
      map (using the weakly-supervised localization method) and guides the 
      high-resolution network to concentrate on the lesion regions. Furthermore, a 
      lesion attention module (LAM) is designed to capture the complementary 
      relationship between the high-resolution features and the low-resolution 
      features, and to fuse the lesion activation map. Experiment results show that the 
      proposed scheme outperforms other existing approaches, and the proposed method 
      can provide lesion activation map with lesion consistency as an additional 
      evidence for clinical diagnosis.

TI  - Various models for diabetic retinopathy screening that can be applied to India.
PG  - 2951-2958
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_1145_21 [doi]
AB  - The increased burden of diabetes in India has resulted in an increase in the 
      complications of diabetes including sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      Visual impairment and blindness due to DR can be prevented by early detection and 
      management of sight-threatening DR. Life-long evaluation by repetitive retinal 
      screening of people with diabetes is an essential strategy as DR has an 
      asymptomatic presentation. Fundus examination by trained ophthalmologists and 
      fundus photography are established modes of screening. Various modes of 
      opportunistic screening have been followed in India. Hospital-based screening 
      (diabetes care/eye care) and community-based screening are the common modes. 
      Tele-ophthalmology programs based on retinal imaging, remote interpretation, and 
      grading of DR by trained graders/ophthalmologists have facilitated greater 
      coverage of DR screening and enabled timely referral of those with 
      sight-threatening DR. DR screening programs use nonmydriatic or mydriatic fundus 
      cameras for retinal photography. Hand-held/smartphone-based fundus cameras that 
      are portable, less expensive, and easy to use in remote places are gaining 
      popularity. Good retinal image quality and accurate diagnosis play an important 
      role in reducing unnecessary referrals. Recent advances like nonmydriatic 
      ultrawide field fundus photography can be used for DR screening, though likely to 
      be more expensive. The advent of artificial intelligence and deep learning has 
      raised the possibility of automated detection of DR. Efforts to increase the 
      awareness regarding DR is essential to ensure compliance to regular follow-up. 
      Cost-effective sustainable models will ensure systematic nation-wide DR screening 
      in the country.

TI  - Assessing the Clinical Utility of Expanded Macular OCTs Using Machine Learning.
PG  - 32

LID - 32
AB  - PURPOSE: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used in the management of 
      retinal pathologies, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic 
      macular edema (DME), and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). We used machine 
      learning techniques to understand diagnostic performance gains from expanding 
      macular OCT B-scans compared with foveal-only OCT B-scans for these conditions. 
      METHODS: Electronic medical records were extracted to obtain 61 B-scans per eye 
      from patients with AMD, diabetic retinopathy, or POAG. We constructed deep neural 
      networks and random forest ensembles and generated area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (AUROC) and area under the precision recall (AUPR) 
      curves. RESULTS: After extracting 630,000 OCT images, we achieved improved AUROC 
      and AUPR curves when comparing the central image (one B-scan) to all images (61 
      B-scans). The AUROC and AUPR points of diminishing return for diagnostic accuracy 
      for macular OCT coverage were found to be within 2.75 to 4.00 mm (14-19 B-scans), 
      4.25 to 4.50 mm (20-21 B-scans), and 4.50 to 6.25 mm (21-28 B-scans) for AMD, 
      DME, and POAG, respectively. All models with >0.25 mm of coverage had 
      statistically significantly improved AUROC/AUPR curves for all diseases (P < 
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Systematically expanded macular coverage models demonstrated 
      significant differences in total macular coverage required for improved 
      diagnostic accuracy, with the largest macular area being relevant in POAG 
      followed by DME and then AMD. These findings support our hypothesis that the 
      extent of macular coverage by OCT imaging in the clinical setting, for any of the 
      three major disorders, has a measurable impact on the functionality of artificial 
      intelligence decision support. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We used machine learning 
      techniques to improve OCT imaging standards for common retinal disease diagnoses.

TI  - New hierarchical approach for microaneurysms detection with matched filter and 
      machine learning.
PG  - 4322-5
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319351 [doi]
AB  - Microaneurysms are regarded as the first signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR), but 
      the microaneurysms are not clear in the color retinal images, and many researches 
      were studied to detect and locate these lesions. In this paper, a new 
      hierarchical computing-aided diagnosis approach is proposed for the 
      microaneurysms detection by using the multi-scale and multi-orientation sum of 
      matched filter (MMMF) and machine learning, where 37 dimensional features are 
      extracted from each candidate. Furthermore, several classifiers such as the 
      k-nearest neighbor (kNN), local linear discrimination analysis (LLDA) and support 
      vector machine (SVM) are modified to distinguish the true microaneurysms from the 
      false ones, which is a typical unbalanced classification problem. The 
      effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the training set of a 
      publicly available database, and the experiment results show that the proposed 
      method has better detection performance including the receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve and the free-response receiver operating 
      characteristic (FROC) curve. Moreover, the proposed method with 37 dimensional 
      features outperforms that with other features and has a sensitivity from 1/8 to 8 
      with the average of all seven points being 0.286 tested on the same database.

AB  - AIMS: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness globally, early 
      detection is critical to prevent vision loss. Traditional screening that, rely on 
      human experts are, however, costly, and time-consuming. The purpose of this 
      systematic review is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone-based 
      artificial intelligence(AI) systems for DR detection. METHODS: Literature review 
      was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane from 
      inception to December 2022. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies 
      evaluating the use of smartphone-based AI algorithms for DR screening in patients 
      with diabetes, with expert human grader as the reference standard. Random-effects 
      model was used to pool sensitivity and specificity. Any DR(ADR) and referable 
      DR(RDR) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Out of 968 identified articles, six 
      diagnostic test accuracy studies met our inclusion criteria, comprising 3,931 
      patients. Four of these studies used the Medios AI algorithm. The pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of ADR were 88 % and 91.5 % 
      respectively and for diagnosis of RDR were 98.2 % and 81.2 % respectively. The 
      overall risk of bias across the studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based AI 
      algorithms show high diagnostic accuracy for detecting DR. However, more 
      high-quality comparative studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness in 
      real-world clinical settings.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic disease that may cause vision loss in 
      diabetic patients. Microaneurysms which are characterized by small red spots on 
      the retina due to fluid or blood leakage from the weak capillary wall often occur 
      during the early stage of DR, making screening at this stage is essential. In 
      this paper, an automatic screening system for early detection of DR in retinal 
      images is developed using a combined shape and texture features. Due to minimum 
      number of hand-crafted features, the computational burden is much reduced. The 
      proposed hybrid multi-kernel support vector machine classifier is constructed by 
      learning a kernel model formed as a combination of the base kernels. This 
      approach outperforms the recent deep learning techniques in terms of the 
      evaluation metrics. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is experimentally 
      validated on three public datasets - Retinopathy Online Challenge, DIARETdB1, 
      MESSIDOR, and AGAR300 (developed for this study). Studies reveal that the 
      proposed model produced the best results of 0.503 in ROC dataset, 0.481 in 
      DIARETdB1, and 0.464 in the MESSIDOR dataset in terms of FROC score. The AGAR300 
      database outperforms the existing MA detection algorithm in terms of FROC, AUC, 
      F1 score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity which guarantees the robustness 
      of this system.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to introduce a new deep learning (DL) model for 
      segmentation of the fovea avascular zone (FAZ) in en face optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA) and compare the results with those of the device's 
      built-in software and manual measurements in healthy subjects and diabetic 
      patients. In this retrospective study, FAZ borders were delineated in the inner 
      retinal slab of 3 × 3 enface OCTA images of 131 eyes of 88 diabetic patients and 
      32 eyes of 18 healthy subjects. To train a deep convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) model, 126 enface OCTA images (104 eyes with diabetic retinopathy and 22 
      normal eyes) were used as training/validation dataset. Then, the accuracy of the 
      model was evaluated using a dataset consisting of OCTA images of 10 normal eyes 
      and 27 eyes with diabetic retinopathy. The CNN model was based on Detectron2, an 
      open-source modular object detection library. In addition, automated FAZ 
      measurements were conducted using the device's built-in commercial software, and 
      manual FAZ delineation was performed using ImageJ software. Bland-Altman analysis 
      was used to show 95% limit of agreement (95% LoA) between different methods. The 
      mean dice similarity coefficient of the DL model was 0.94 ± 0.04 in the testing 
      dataset. There was excellent agreement between automated, DL model and manual 
      measurements of FAZ in healthy subjects (95% LoA of - 0.005 to 0.026 mm(2) 
      between automated and manual measurement and 0.000 to 0.009 mm(2) between DL and 
      manual FAZ area). In diabetic eyes, the agreement between DL and manual 
      measurements was excellent (95% LoA of - 0.063 to 0.095), however, there was a 
      poor agreement between the automated and manual method (95% LoA of - 0.186 to 
      0.331). The presence of diabetic macular edema and intraretinal cysts at the 
      fovea were associated with erroneous FAZ measurements by the device's built-in 
      software. In conclusion, the DL model showed an excellent accuracy in detection 
      of FAZ border in enfaces OCTA images of both diabetic patients and healthy 
      subjects. The DL and manual measurements outperformed the automated measurements 
      of the built-in software.

AB  - Diabetes is characterized by constant high level of blood glucose. The human body 
      needs to maintain insulin at very constrict range. The patients who are all 
      affected by diabetes for a long time affected by eye disease called Diabetic 
      Retinopathy (DR). The retinal landmarks namely Optic disc is predicted and masked 
      to decrease the false positive in the exudates detection. The abnormalities like 
      Exudates, Microaneurysms and Hemorrhages are segmented to classify the various 
      stages of DR. The proposed approach is employed to separate the landmarks of 
      retina and lesions of retina for the classification of stages of DR. The 
      segmentation algorithms like Gabor double-sided hysteresis thresholding, maximum 
      intensity variation, inverse surface adaptive thresholding, multi-agent approach 
      and toboggan segmentation are used to detect and segment BVs, ODs, EXs, MAs and 
      HAs. The feature vector formation and machine learning algorithm used to classify 
      the various stages of DR are evaluated using images available in various retinal 
      databases, and their performance measures are presented in this paper.

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis from Retinal Images Using Modified Hopfield Neural 
      Network.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1111-6 [doi]
AB  - Disease diagnosis from medical images has become increasingly important in 
      medical science. Abnormality identification in retinal images has become a 
      challenging task in medical science. Effective machine learning and soft 
      computing methods should be used to facilitate Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis 
      from Retinal Images. Artificial Neural Networks are widely preferred for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Diagnosis from Retinal Images. It was observed that the conventional 
      neural networks especially the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) may be inaccurate 
      due to the weight values are not adjusted in the training process. This paper 
      presents a new Modified Hopfield Neural Network (MHNN) for abnormality 
      classification from human retinal images. It relies on the idea that both weight 
      values and output values can be adjusted simultaneously. The novelty of the 
      proposed method lies in the training algorithm. In conventional method, the 
      weights remain fixed but the weights are changing in the proposed method. 
      Experimental performed on the Lotus Eye Care Hospital containing 540 images 
      collected showed that the proposed MHNN yields an average sensitivity and 
      specificity of 0.99 and accuracy of 99.25%. The proposed MHNN is better than HNN 
      and other neural network approaches for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis from 
      Retinal Images.

TI  - An Open-Source Deep Learning Network for Reconstruction of High-Resolution OCT 
      Angiograms of Retinal Intermediate and Deep Capillary Plexuses.

AB  - PURPOSE: We propose a deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithm to 
      produce high-resolution optical coherence tomographic angiograms (OCTA) of the 
      intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP). METHODS: In 
      this study, 6-mm × 6-mm macular scans with a 400 × 400 A-line sampling density 
      and 3-mm × 3-mm scans with a 304 × 304 A-line sampling density were acquired on 
      one or both eyes of 180 participants (including 230 eyes with diabetic 
      retinopathy and 44 healthy controls) using a 70-kHz commercial OCT system 
      (RTVue-XR; Optovue, Inc., Fremont, California, USA). Projection-resolved OCTA 
      algorithm removed projection artifacts in voxel. ICP and DCP angiograms were 
      generated by maximum projection of the OCTA signal within the respective plexus. 
      We proposed a deep learning-based method, which receives inputs from registered 
      3-mm × 3-mm ICP and DCP angiograms with proper sampling density as the ground 
      truth reference to reconstruct 6-mm × 6-mm high-resolution ICP and DCP en face 
      OCTA. We applied the same network on 3-mm × 3-mm angiograms to enhance these 
      images further. We evaluated the reconstructed 3-mm × 3-mm and 6-mm × 6-mm 
      angiograms based on vascular connectivity, Weber contrast, false flow signal 
      (flow signal erroneously generated from background), and the noise intensity in 
      the foveal avascular zone. RESULTS: Compared to the originals, the Deep Capillary 
      Angiogram Reconstruction Network (DCARnet)-enhanced 6-mm × 6-mm angiograms had 
      significantly reduced noise intensity (ICP, 7.38 ± 25.22, P < 0.001; DCP, 11.20 ± 
      22.52, P < 0.001), improved vascular connectivity (ICP, 0.95 ± 0.01, P < 0.001; 
      DCP, 0.96 ± 0.01, P < 0.001), and enhanced Weber contrast (ICP, 4.25 ± 0.10, P < 
      0.001; DCP, 3.84 ± 0.84, P < 0.001), without generating false flow signal when 
      noise intensity lower than 650. The DCARnet-enhanced 3-mm × 3-mm angiograms also 
      reduced noise, improved connectivity, and enhanced Weber contrast in 3-mm × 3-mm 
      ICP and DCP angiograms from 101 eyes. In addition, DCARnet preserved the 
      appearance of the dilated vessels in the reconstructed angiograms in diabetic 
      eyes. CONCLUSIONS: DCARnet can enhance 3-mm × 3-mm and 6-mm × 6-mm ICP and DCP 
      angiogram image quality without introducing artifacts. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: 
      The enhanced 6-mm × 6-mm angiograms may be easier for clinicians to interpret 
      qualitatively.

TI  - Quantification of Fluid Resolution and Visual Acuity Gain in Patients With 
      Diabetic Macular Edema Using Deep Learning: A Post Hoc Analysis of a Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 945-953
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2457 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Large amounts of optical coherence tomographic (OCT) data of diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) are acquired, but many morphologic features have yet to be 
      identified and quantified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the volumetric change of 
      intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) in DME during anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor treatment using deep learning algorithms. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, 
      the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (protocol T), assessed 6945 
      spectral-domain OCT volume scans of 570 eyes from 570 study participants with 
      DME. The original trial was performed from August 21, 2012, to October 18, 2018. 
      This analysis was performed from December 7, 2017, to January 15, 2020. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants were treated according to a predefined, standardized 
      protocol with aflibercept, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab with or without deferred 
      laser. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The association of treatment with IRF and SRF 
      volumes and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during 12 months using deep 
      learning algorithms. RESULTS: Among the 570 study participants (302 [53%] male; 
      369 [65%] white; mean [SD] age, 43.4 [12.6] years), the mean fluid volumes in the 
      central 3 mm were 448.6 nL (95% CI, 412.3-485.0 nL) of IRF and 36.9 nL (95% CI, 
      27.0-46.7 nL) of SRF at baseline and 161.2 nL (95% CI, 135.1-187.4 nL) of IRF and 
      4.4 nL (95% CI, 1.7-7.1 nL) of SRF at 12 months. The presence of SRF at baseline 
      was associated with a worse baseline BCVA Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Study (ETDRS) score of 63.2 (95% CI, 60.2-66.1) (approximate Snellen equivalent 
      of 20/63 [95% CI, 20/50-20/63]) in eyes with SRF vs 66.9 (95% CI, 65.7-68.1) 
      (approximate Snellen equivalent, 20/50 [95% CI, 20/40-20/50]) without SRF 
      (P < .001) and a greater gain in ETDRS score (0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8) every 4 weeks 
      during follow-up in eyes with SRF at baseline vs 0.4 (95% CI, 0.3-0.5) in eyes 
      without SRF at baseline (P = .02) when adjusted for baseline BCVA. Aflibercept 
      was associated with greater reduction of IRF volume compared with bevacizumab 
      after the first injection (difference, 79.8 nL; 95% CI, 5.3-162.5 nL; P < .001) 
      and every 4 weeks thereafter (difference, 10.4 nL; 95% CI, 0.7-20.0 nL; 
      P = .004). Ranibizumab was associated with a greater reduction of IRF after the 
      first injection compared with bevacizumab (difference, 75.2 nL; 95% CI, 1.4-154.7 
      nL; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Automated segmentation of fluid in DME 
      revealed that the presence of SRF was associated with lower baseline BCVA but 
      with good response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. These 
      automated spectral-domain OCT analyses may be used clinically to assess 
      anatomical change during therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Investigations of severity level measurements for diabetic macular oedema using 
      machine learning algorithms.
PG  - 929-938

AB  - BACKGROUND: The macula is an important part of the human visual system and is 
      responsible for clear and colour vision. Macular oedema happens when fluid and 
      protein deposit on or below the macula of the eye and cause the macula to thicken 
      and swell. Normally, it occurs due to diabetes called diabetic macular oedema. 
      Diabetic macular oedema (DME) is one of the main causes of visual impairment in 
      patients. AIM: The aims of the present study are to detect and localize 
      abnormalities in blood vessels with respect to macula in order to prevent vision 
      loss for the diabetic patients. METHODS: In this work, a novel fully computerized 
      algorithm is used for the recognition of various diseases in macula using both 
      fundus images and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Abnormal blood 
      vessels are segmented using thresholding algorithm. The classification is 
      performed by three different classifiers, namely, the support vector machine 
      (SVM), cascade neural network (CNN) and partial least square (PLS) classifiers, 
      which are employed to identify whether the image is normal or abnormal. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of all of the classifiers are compared based on their 
      accuracy. The classifier accuracies of the SVM, cascade neural network and 
      partial least square are 98.33, 97.16 and 94.34%, respectively. While analysing 
      DME using both images, OCT produced efficient output than fundus images. 
      Information about the severity of the disease and the localization of the 
      pathologies is very useful to the ophthalmologist for diagnosing disease and 
      choosing the proper treatment for a patient to prevent vision loss.

TI  - Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy With Artificial Intelligence: What Information 
      Should Be Included to Ensure Ethical Informed Consent?
PG  - 695217
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.695217 [doi]
LID - 695217
AB  - Purpose: The method of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) through artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based systems has been commercially available since 2018. This 
      introduces new ethical challenges with regard to obtaining informed consent from 
      patients. The purpose of this work is to develop a checklist of items to be 
      disclosed when diagnosing DR with AI systems in a primary care setting. Methods: 
      Two systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science 
      databases: a narrow search focusing on DR and a broad search on general issues of 
      AI-based diagnosis. An ethics content analysis was conducted inductively to 
      extract two features of included publications: (1) novel information content for 
      AI-aided diagnosis and (2) the ethical justification for its disclosure. Results: 
      The narrow search yielded n = 537 records of which n = 4 met the inclusion 
      criteria. The information process was scarcely addressed for primary care 
      setting. The broad search yielded n = 60 records of which n = 11 were included. 
      In total, eight novel elements were identified to be included in the information 
      process for ethical reasons, all of which stem from the technical specifics of 
      medical AI. Conclusions: Implications for the general practitioner are two-fold: 
      First, doctors need to be better informed about the ethical implications of novel 
      technologies and must understand them to properly inform patients. Second, 
      patient's overconfidence or fears can be countered by communicating the risks, 
      limitations, and potential benefits of diagnostic AI systems. If patients accept 
      and are aware of the limitations of AI-aided diagnosis, they increase their 
      chances of being diagnosed and treated in time.

AB  - Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has caused many 
      death cases and affected all sectors of human life. With gradual progression of 
      time, COVID-19 was declared by the world health organization (WHO) as an 
      outbreak, which has imposed a heavy burden on almost all countries, especially 
      ones with weaker health systems and ones with slow responses. In the field of 
      healthcare, deep learning has been implemented in many applications, e.g., 
      diabetic retinopathy detection, lung nodule classification, fetal localization, 
      and thyroid diagnosis. Numerous sources of medical images (e.g., X-ray, CT, and 
      MRI) make deep learning a great technique to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. 
      Motivated by this fact, a large number of research works have been proposed and 
      developed for the initial months of 2020. In this paper, we first focus on 
      summarizing the state-of-the-art research works related to deep learning 
      applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Then, we provide an overview 
      of deep learning and its applications to healthcare found in the last decade. 
      Next, three use cases in China, Korea, and Canada are also presented to show deep 
      learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Finally, we discuss 
      several challenges and issues related to deep learning implementations for 
      COVID-19 medical image processing, which are expected to drive further studies in 
      controlling the outbreak and controlling the crisis, which results in smart 
      healthy cities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Use adjudication to quantify errors in diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading 
      based on individual graders and majority decision, and to train an improved 
      automated algorithm for DR grading. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Retinal fundus images from DR screening programs. METHODS: Images were each 
      graded by the algorithm, U.S. board-certified ophthalmologists, and retinal 
      specialists. The adjudicated consensus of the retinal specialists served as the 
      reference standard. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For agreement between different 
      graders as well as between the graders and the algorithm, we measured the 
      (quadratic-weighted) kappa score. To compare the performance of different forms 
      of manual grading and the algorithm for various DR severity cutoffs (e.g., mild 
      or worse DR, moderate or worse DR), we measured area under the curve (AUC), 
      sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: Of the 193 discrepancies between 
      adjudication by retinal specialists and majority decision of ophthalmologists, 
      the most common were missing microaneurysm (MAs) (36%), artifacts (20%), and 
      misclassified hemorrhages (16%). Relative to the reference standard, the kappa 
      for individual retinal specialists, ophthalmologists, and algorithm ranged from 
      0.82 to 0.91, 0.80 to 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the 
      majority decision of ophthalmologists had a sensitivity of 0.838 and specificity 
      of 0.981. The algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.923, and AUC 
      of 0.986. For mild or worse DR, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.970, 
      specificity of 0.917, and AUC of 0.986. By using a small number of adjudicated 
      consensus grades as a tuning dataset and higher-resolution images as input, the 
      algorithm improved in AUC from 0.934 to 0.986 for moderate or worse DR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adjudication reduces the errors in DR grading. A small set of 
      adjudicated DR grades allows substantial improvements in algorithm performance. 
      The resulting algorithm's performance was on par with that of individual U.S. 
      Board-Certified ophthalmologists and retinal specialists.

      diabetic retinopathy using OCT images.
PG  - 4730

AB  - This study proposes a novel computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) system for early 
      diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      B-scans. The CAD system is based on fusing novel OCT markers that describe both 
      the morphology/anatomy and the reflectivity of retinal layers to improve DR 
      diagnosis. This system separates retinal layers automatically using a 
      segmentation approach based on an adaptive appearance and their prior shape 
      information. High-order morphological and novel reflectivity markers are 
      extracted from individual segmented layers. Namely, the morphological markers are 
      layer thickness and tortuosity while the reflectivity markers are the 1st-order 
      reflectivity of the layer in addition to local and global high-order reflectivity 
      based on Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix 
      (GLCM), respectively. The extracted image-derived markers are represented using 
      cumulative distribution function (CDF) descriptors. The constructed CDFs are then 
      described using their statistical measures, i.e., the 10th through 90th 
      percentiles with a 10% increment. For individual layer classification, each 
      extracted descriptor of a given layer is fed to a support vector machine (SVM) 
      classifier with a linear kernel. The results of the four classifiers are then 
      fused using a backpropagation neural network (BNN) to diagnose each retinal 
      layer. For global subject diagnosis, classification outputs (probabilities) of 
      the twelve layers are fused using another BNN to make the final diagnosis of the 
      B-scan. This system is validated and tested on 130 patients, with two scans for 
      both eyes (i.e. 260 OCT images), with a balanced number of normal and DR subjects 
      using different validation metrics: 2-folds, 4-folds, 10-folds, and 
      leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approaches. The performance of the 
      proposed system was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and 
      accuracy metrics. The system's performance after the fusion of these different 
      markers showed better performance compared with individual markers and other 
      machine learning fusion methods. Namely, it achieved [Formula: see text], 
      [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], respectively, 
      using the LOSO cross-validation technique. The reported results, based on the 
      integration of morphology and reflectivity markers and by using state-of-the-art 
      machine learning classifications, demonstrate the ability of the proposed system 
      to diagnose the DR early.

AB  - PURPOSE: To predict visual acuity (VA) 1 month after anti-vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) therapy in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) by 
      using machine learning. METHODS: This retrospective study included 281 eyes with 
      DME receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment from January 1, 2019, to April 1, 
      2021. Eighteen features from electronic medical records and measurements data 
      from OCT images were extracted. The data obtained from January 1, 2019, to 
      November 1, 2020, were used as the training set; the data obtained from November 
      1, 2020, to April 1, 2021, were used as the validation set. Six different machine 
      learning algorithms were used to predict VA in patients after anti-VEGF therapy. 
      After the initial detailed investigation, we designed an optimization model for 
      convenient application. The VA predicted by machine learning was compared with 
      the ground truth. RESULTS: The ensemble algorithm (linear regression + random 
      forest regressor) performed best in VA and VA variance predictions. In the 
      validation set, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of VA predictions were 
      0.137-0.153 logMAR (within 7-8 letters), and the mean square errors (MSEs) were 
      0.033-0.045 logMAR (within 2-3 letters) for the 1-month VA predictions, 
      respectively. For the prediction of VA variance at 1 month, the MAEs were 
      0.164-0.169 logMAR (within 9 letters), and the MSEs were 0.056-0.059 logMAR 
      (within 3 letters), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning models could 
      accurately predict VA and VA variance in DME patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy 
      1 month after, which would be much valuable to guide precise individualized 
      interventions and manage expectations in clinical practice.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes. 
      Microaneurysms (MAs) are often observed in the retinal vessels of diabetic 
      patients and represent one of the earliest signs of DR. Accurate and efficient 
      detection of MAs is crucial for the diagnosis of DR. In this study, an automatic 
      model (MA-YOLO) is proposed for MA detection in fluorescein angiography (FFA) 
      images. To obtain detailed features and improve the discriminability of MAs in 
      FFA images, SwinIR was utilized to reconstruct super-resolution images. To solve 
      the problems of missed detection of small features and feature information loss, 
      an MA detection layer was added between the neck and the head sections of YOLOv8. 
      To enhance the generalization ability of the MA-YOLO model, transfer learning was 
      conducted between high-resolution images and low-resolution images. To avoid 
      excessive penalization due to geometric factors and address sample distribution 
      imbalance, the loss function was optimized by taking the Wise-IoU loss as a 
      bounding box regression loss. The performance of the MA-YOLO model in MA 
      detection was compared with that of other state-of-the-art models, including SSD, 
      RetinaNet, YOLOv5, YOLOX, and YOLOv7. The results showed that the MA-YOLO model 
      had the best performance in MA detection, as shown by its optimal metrics, 
      including recall, precision, F1 score, and AP, which were 88.23%, 97.98%, 92.85%, 
      and 94.62%, respectively. Collectively, the proposed MA-YOLO model is suitable 
      for the automatic detection of MAs in FFA images, which can assist 
      ophthalmologists in the diagnosis of the progression of DR.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of blindness 
      worldwide. In clinical practice, the detection of DR often takes a lot of time 
      and effort for ophthalmologist. It is necessary to develop an automatic assistant 
      diagnosis method based on medical image analysis techniques. METHODS: Firstly, we 
      design a feature enhanced attention module to capture focus lesions and regions. 
      Secondly, we propose a stage sampling strategy to solve the problem of data 
      imbalance on datasets and avoid the CNN ignoring the focus features of samples 
      that account for small parts. Finally, we treat DR detection as a regression task 
      to keep the gradual change characteristics of lesions and output the final 
      classification results through the optimization method on the validation set. 
      RESULTS: Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source datasets. Our methods 
      achieve 0.851 quadratic weighted kappa which outperforms first place in the 
      Kaggle DR detection competition based on the EyePACS dataset and get the accuracy 
      of 0.914 in the referable/non-referable task and 0.913 in the normal/abnormal 
      task based on the Messidor dataset. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we propose three 
      novel automatic DR detection methods based on deep convolutional neural networks. 
      The results illustrate that our methods can obtain comparable performance 
      compared with previous methods and generate visualization pictures with potential 
      lesions for doctors and patients.

TI  - An Economic Analysis for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Screening for 
      Diabetic Retinopathy in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB  - This is a systematic review of 25 publications on the topics of the prevalence 
      and cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Trinidad and Tobago, the cost of 
      traditional methods of screening for DR, and the use and cost of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in screening for DR. Analysis of these publications was used to 
      identify and make estimates for how resources allocated to ophthalmology in 
      public health systems in Trinidad and Tobago can be more efficiently utilized by 
      employing AI in diagnosing treatable DR. DR screening was found to be an 
      effective method of detecting the disease. Screening was found to be a 
      universally cost-effective method of disease prevention and for altering the 
      natural history of the disease in the spectrum of low-middle to high-income 
      economies, such as Rwanda, Thailand, China, South Korea, and Singapore. AI and 
      deep learning systems were found to be clinically superior to, or as effective 
      as, human graders in areas where they were deployed, indicating that the systems 
      are clinically safe. They have been shown to improve access to diabetic retinal 
      screening, improve compliance with screening appointments, and prove to be 
      cost-effective, especially in rural areas. Trinidad and Tobago, which is 
      estimated to be disproportionately more affected by the burden of DR when 
      projected out to the mid-21st century, stands to save as much as US$60 million 
      annually from the implementation of an AI-based system to screen for DR versus 
      conventional manual grading.

TI  - MSLF-Net: A Multi-Scale and Multi-Level Feature Fusion Net for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Segmentation.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12122918 [doi]
LID - 2918
AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetic complication that predisposes patients to 
      visual impairments that could lead to blindness. Lesion segmentation using deep 
      learning algorithms is an effective measure to screen and prevent early DR. 
      However, there are several types of DR with varying sizes and high inter-class 
      similarity, making segmentation difficult. In this paper, we propose a supervised 
      segmentation method (MSLF-Net) based on multi-scale-multi-level feature fusion to 
      achieve accurate end-to-end DR lesion segmentation. MSLF-Net builds a Multi-Scale 
      Feature Extraction (MSFE) module to extract multi-scale information and provide 
      more comprehensive features for segmentation. This paper further introduces the 
      Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF) module to improve feature fusion using a 
      cross-layer structure. This structure only fuses low- and high-level features of 
      the same class based on category supervision, avoiding feature contamination. 
      Moreover, this paper produces additional masked images for the dataset and 
      performs image enhancement operations to ensure that the proposed method is 
      trainable and functional on small datasets. The extensive experiments are 
      conducted on public datasets IDRID and e_ophtha. The results showed that our 
      proposed feature enhancement method can perform feature fusion more effectively. 
      Therefore, In the end-to-end DR segmentation neural network model, MSLF Net is 
      superior to other similar models in segmentation, and can effectively improve the 
      DR lesion segmentation performance.

AB  - Recent developments in deep learning have shown success in accurately predicting 
      the location of biological markers in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes 
      of patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Retinopathy 
      (DR). We propose a method that automatically locates biological markers to the 
      Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) rings, only requiring 
      B-scan-level presence annotations. We trained a neural network using 22,723 OCT 
      B-Scans of 460 eyes (433 patients) with AMD and DR, annotated with slice-level 
      labels for Intraretinal Fluid (IRF) and Subretinal Fluid (SRF). The neural 
      network outputs were mapped into the corresponding ETDRS rings. We incorporated 
      the class annotations and domain knowledge into a loss function to constrain the 
      output with biologically plausible solutions. The method was tested on a set of 
      OCT volumes with 322 eyes (189 patients) with Diabetic Macular Edema, with 
      slice-level SRF and IRF presence annotations for the ETDRS rings. Our method 
      accurately predicted the presence of IRF and SRF in each ETDRS ring, 
      outperforming previous baselines even in the most challenging scenarios. Our 
      model was also successfully applied to en-face marker segmentation and showed 
      consistency within C-scans, despite not incorporating volume information in the 
      training process. We achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.946 for the 
      prediction of the IRF area.

AB  - In recent years, diabetic retinopathy (DR) needs to be focused with the intention 
      of developing accurate and effective approaches by accomplishing the existing 
      challenges in the traditional models. With this objective, this paper aims to 
      introduce an effective diagnosis system by utilizing retinal fundus images. The 
      implementation of this diagnosis model incorporates 4 stages like (i) 
      preprocessing, (ii) blood vessel segmentation, (iii) feature extraction, as well 
      as (iv) classification. Originally, the median filter as well as contrast limited 
      adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) help to preprocess the image. Moreover, 
      the Fuzzy C Mean (FCM) thresholding is applied for blood vessel segmentation, 
      which generates stochastic clustering of pixels to obtain enhanced threshold 
      values. Further, feature extraction is accomplished by utilizing gray-level 
      run-length matrix (GLRM), local, and morphological transformation-based features. 
      Furthermore, a deep learning (DL) model known as convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) is employed for the diagnosis or classification purpose. As a main novelty, 
      this paper introduces an optimal feature selection as well as classification 
      model. Further, the feature selection is done optimally by FireFly Migration 
      Operator-based Monarch Butterfly Optimization (FM-MBO) which hybridized of the 
      monarch butterfly optimization (MBO) and fire fly (FF) algorithms as the entire 
      adopted extracted features attain higher feature length. Moreover, the proposed 
      FM-MBO algorithm helps for optimizing the count of CNN's convolutional neurons to 
      further improve the performance accuracy. At the end, the enhanced outcomes of 
      the adopted diagnostic scheme are validated via a valuable comparative 
      examination in terms of significant performance measures.

AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies that identify putative genes associated with diabetic 
      retinopathy are only focusing on specific clinical stages, thus resulting genes 
      are not necessarily reflective of disease progression. This study identified 
      genes associated with the severity level of diabetic retinopathy using the 
      likelihood-ratio test (LRT) and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) model, as well 
      as to profile immune and retinal cell landscape in progressive diabetic 
      retinopathy using a machine learning deconvolution approach. METHODS: This study 
      used a published transcriptomic dataset (GSE160306) from macular regions of 
      donors with different degrees of diabetic retinopathy (10 healthy controls, 10 
      cases of diabetes, 9 cases of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and 10 cases 
      of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or combined with diabetic macular edema). 
      LRT and OLR models were applied to identify severity-associated genes. In 
      addition, CIBERSORTx was used to estimate proportional changes of immune and 
      retinal cells in progressive diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: By controlling for 
      gender and age using LRT and OLR, 50 genes were identified to be significantly 
      increased in expression with the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Functional 
      enrichment analyses suggested these severity-associated genes are related to 
      inflammation and immune responses. CCND1 and FCGR2B are further identified as key 
      regulators to interact with many other severity-associated genes and are crucial 
      to inflammation. Deconvolution analyses demonstrated that the proportions of 
      memory B cells, M2 macrophages, and Müller glia were significantly increased with 
      the progression of diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate 
      that deep analyses of transcriptomic data can advance our understanding of 
      progressive ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by applying LRT and 
      OLR models as well as bulk gene expression deconvolution.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to demonstrate how a retinal image analysis 
      system, DAPHNE, supports the optimization of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening 
      programs for grading color fundus photography. METHOD: Retinal image sets, graded 
      by trained and certified human graders, were acquired from Saudi Arabia, China, 
      and Kenya. Each image was subsequently analyzed by the DAPHNE automated software. 
      The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the 
      detection of referable DR or diabetic macular edema were evaluated, taking human 
      grading or clinical assessment outcomes to be the gold standard. The automated 
      software's ability to identify co-pathology and to correctly label DR lesions was 
      also assessed. RESULTS: In all three datasets the agreement between the automated 
      software and human grading was between 0.84 to 0.88. Sensitivity did not vary 
      significantly between populations (94.28%-97.1%) with specificity ranging between 
      90.33% to 92.12%. There were excellent negative predictive values above 93% in 
      all image sets. The software was able to monitor DR progression between baseline 
      and follow-up images with the changes visualized. No cases of proliferative DR or 
      DME were missed in the referable recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The DAPHNE 
      automated software demonstrated its ability not only to grade images but also to 
      reliably monitor and visualize progression. Therefore it has the potential to 
      assist timely image analysis in patients with diabetes in varied populations and 
      also help to discover subtle signs of sight-threatening disease onset. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This article takes research on machine vision and 
      evaluates its readiness for clinical use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy is a prevalent complication among diabetic 
      patients that, if not predicted and treated promptly, can lead to blindness. This 
      paper proposes a method for accurately and swiftly predicting the degree of 
      diabetic retinopathy using a hybrid neural network model. Timely prediction of 
      diabetic retinopathy is crucial in preventing blindness associated with this 
      condition. METHODS: This study aims to enhance the prediction accuracy of 
      diabetic retinopathy by utilizing the hybrid neural network model EfficientNet 
      and Swin Transformer. The specific methodology includes: (1) combining local and 
      global features to accurately capture lesion characteristics by leveraging the 
      strengths of both Swin Transformer and EfficientNet models; (2) improving 
      prediction accuracy through a comprehensive analysis of the model's training 
      details and applying data augmentation techniques such as Gaussian blur to 
      enhance the hybrid model's performance; (3) validating the effectiveness and 
      utility of the proposed hybrid model for diabetic retinopathy detection through 
      extensive experimental evaluations and comparisons with other deep learning 
      models. RESULTS: The hybrid model was trained and tested on the large-scale 
      real-world diabetic retinopathy detection dataset APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. 
      The experimental results show that the hybrid model in this paper achieves the 
      best results in all metrics, including sensitivity of 0.95, specificity of 0.98, 
      accuracy of 0.97, and AUC of 0.97. The performance of the model is significantly 
      improved compared to the mainstream methods currently employed. In addition, the 
      model provides interpretable neural network details through class activation 
      maps, which enables the visualization of diabetic retinopathy. This feature helps 
      physicians to make more accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions. The model 
      proposed in this paper shows higher accuracy in detecting and diagnosing diabetic 
      retinopathy, which is crucial for the treatment and rehabilitation of diabetic 
      patients. CONCLUSION: The hybrid neural network model based on EfficientNet and 
      Swin Transformer significantly contributes to the prediction of diabetic 
      retinopathy. By combining local and global features, the model achieves improved 
      prediction accuracy. The validity and utility of the model are verified through 
      experimental evaluations. This research provides robust support for the early 
      diagnosis and treatment of diabetic patients.

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction by Ensemble Learning Based on Biochemical and 
      Physical Data.
LID - 10.3390/s21113663 [doi]
LID - 3663
AB  - (1) Background: Diabetic retinopathy, one of the most serious complications of 
      diabetes, is the primary cause of blindness in developed countries. Therefore, 
      the prediction of diabetic retinopathy has a positive impact on its early 
      detection and treatment. The prediction of diabetic retinopathy based on 
      high-dimensional and small-sample-structured datasets (such as biochemical data 
      and physical data) was the problem to be solved in this study. (2) Methods: This 
      study proposed the XGB-Stacking model with the foundation of XGBoost and 
      stacking. First, a wrapped feature selection algorithm, XGBIBS (Improved Backward 
      Search Based on XGBoost), was used to reduce data feature redundancy and improve 
      the effect of a single ensemble learning classifier. Second, in view of the 
      slight limitation of a single classifier, a stacking model fusion method, 
      Sel-Stacking (Select-Stacking), which keeps Label-Proba as the input matrix of 
      meta-classifier and determines the optimal combination of learners by a global 
      search, was used in the XGB-Stacking model. (3) Results: XGBIBS greatly improved 
      the prediction accuracy and the feature reduction rate of a single classifier. 
      Compared to a single classifier, the accuracy of the Sel-Stacking model was 
      improved to varying degrees. Experiments proved that the prediction model of 
      XGB-Stacking based on the XGBIBS algorithm and the Sel-Stacking method made 
      effective predictions on diabetes retinopathy. (4) Conclusion: The XGB-Stacking 
      prediction model of diabetic retinopathy based on biochemical and physical data 
      had outstanding performance. This is highly significant to improve the screening 
      efficiency of diabetes retinopathy and reduce the cost of diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a deep learning (DL)-based artificial 
      intelligence (AI) hierarchical diagnosis software, EyeWisdom V1 for diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective study was a multicenter, 
      double-blind, and self-controlled clinical trial. Non-dilated posterior pole 
      fundus images were evaluated by ophthalmologists and EyeWisdom V1, respectively. 
      The diagnosis of manual grading was considered as the gold standard. Primary 
      evaluation index (sensitivity and specificity) and secondary evaluation index 
      like positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), etc., 
      were calculated to evaluate the performance of EyeWisdom V1. RESULTS: A total of 
      1,089 fundus images from 630 patients were included, with a mean age of (56.52 ± 
      11.13) years. For any DR, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 98.23% 
      (95% CI 96.93-99.08%), 74.45% (95% CI 69.95-78.60%), 86.38% (95% CI 
      83.76-88.72%), and 96.23% (95% CI 93.50-98.04%), respectively; For 
      sight-threatening DR (STDR, severe non-proliferative DR or worse), the above 
      indicators were 80.47% (95% CI 75.07-85.14%), 97.96% (95% CI 96.75-98.81%), 
      92.38% (95% CI 88.07-95.50%), and 94.23% (95% CI 92.46-95.68%); For referral DR 
      (moderate non-proliferative DR or worse), the sensitivity and specificity were 
      92.96% (95% CI 90.66-94.84%) and 93.32% (95% CI 90.65-95.42%), with the PPV of 
      94.93% (95% CI 92.89-96.53%) and the NPV of 90.78% (95% CI 87.81-93.22%). The 
      kappa score of EyeWisdom V1 was 0.860 (0.827-0.890) with the AUC of 0.958 for 
      referral DR. CONCLUSION: The EyeWisdom V1 could provide reliable DR grading and 
      referral recommendation based on the fundus images of diabetics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Lobe application, a machine 
      learning (ML) tool that can be used on a personal computer without requiring 
      coding expertise, in the recognition and classification of diabetic macular edema 
      (DME) in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A total of 695 cross-sectional SD-OCT images from 336 patients with 
      DME and 200 OCT images of 200 healthy controls were included. Images with DME 
      were classified into three main types: diffuse retinal edema (DRE), cystoid 
      macular edema (CME), and cystoid macular degeneration (CMD). To develop the ML 
      model, we used the desktop-based code-free Lobe application, which includes a 
      pre-trained ResNet-50 V2 convolutional neural network and is available free of 
      charge. The performance of the trained model in recognizing and classifying DME 
      was evaluated with 41 DRE, 28 CMD, 70 CME, and 40 normal SD-OCT images that were 
      not used in the training. RESULTS: The developed model showed 99.28% sensitivity 
      and 100% specificity for class-independent detection of DME. Sensitivity and 
      specificity by labels were 87.80% and 98.57% for DRE, 96.43% and 99.29% for CME, 
      and 95.71% and 95.41% for CMD, respectively. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this 
      is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of Lobe with ophthalmological 
      images, and the results indicate that it can be used with high efficiency in the 
      recognition and classification of DME from SD-OCT images by ophthalmologists 
      without coding expertise.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the capabilities of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 
      (ChatGPT) and Vertex AI in executing code-free preprocessing, training machine 
      learning (ML) models, and analyzing the data. DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic 
      test or technology. PARTICIPANTS: ChatGPT and Vetrex AI as publicly available 
      large language model and ML platform, respectively. METHODS: ChatGPT was employed 
      to improve the resolution of fundus photography images from the Methods to 
      Evaluate Segmentation and Indexing Techniques in the field of Retinal 
      Ophthalmology (Messidor-2) open-source dataset using the Contrast Limited 
      Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique by Fiji software. Subsequently, 
      Vertex AI, an automated ML (AutoML) platform, was utilized to develop 2 
      classification models. The first model served as a binary classifier for 
      detecting the presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR), while the second determined 
      its severity. Finally, ChatGPT was used to provide scripts for R and Python 
      programming languages for data analysis and was also directly employed in 
      analyzing the data in a code-free method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluating the 
      utility of ChatGPT in generating scripts for preprocessing images using Fiji and 
      analyzing data across Python and R and assessing its potential in analyzing data 
      through a code-free method. Investigating the capabilities of Vertex AI to train 
      image classification models for detection of DR and its severity. RESULTS: Two ML 
      models were trained using 1740 images from the Messidor-2 database. The first 
      model, designed to detect the severity of DR, achieved an area under the 
      precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.81, with a precision rate of 81.81% and 
      recall of 72.83%. The second model, tailored for the detection of the presence of 
      DR, recorded a precision and recall of 84.48% with an AUPRC of 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: 
      ChatGPT and Vertex AI have the potential to enable physicians without coding 
      expertise to preprocess images, analyze data, and train ML models. FINANCIAL

AB  - Hyperreflective foci (HRF) have been associated with retinal disease progression 
      and demonstrated as a negative prognostic biomarker for visual function. 
      Automated segmentation of HRF in retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans 
      can be beneficial to identify the formation and movement of the HRF biomarker as 
      a retinal disease progresses and can serve as the first step in understanding the 
      nature and severity of the disease. In this paper, we propose a fully automated 
      deep neural network based HRF segmentation model in OCT images. We enhance the 
      model's performance by using a patch-based strategy that increases the model's 
      compute on the HRF pixels. The patch-based strategy is evaluated against state of 
      the art HRF segmentation pipelines on clinical retinal image data. Our results 
      shows that the patch-based approach demonstrates a high precision score and 
      intersection over union (IOU) using a ResNet34 segmentation model with Binary 
      Cross Entropy loss function. The HRF segmentation pipeline can be used for 
      analyzing HRF biomarkers for different retinopathies.

AB  - The automated analysis of retinal images is a widely researched area which can 
      help to diagnose several diseases like diabetic retinopathy in early stages of 
      the disease. More specifically, separation of vessels and lesions is very 
      critical as features of these structures are directly related to the diagnosis 
      and treatment process of diabetic retinopathy. The complexity of the retinal 
      image contents especially in images with severe diabetic retinopathy makes 
      detection of vascular structure and lesions difficult. In this paper, a novel 
      framework based on morphological component analysis (MCA) is presented which 
      benefits from the adaptive representations obtained via dictionary learning. In 
      the proposed Bi-level Adaptive MCA (BAMCA), MCA is extended to locally deal with 
      sparse representation of the retinal images at patch level whereas the 
      decomposition process occurs globally at the image level. BAMCA method with 
      appropriately offline learnt dictionaries is adopted to work on retinal images 
      with severe diabetic retinopathy in order to simultaneously separate vessels and 
      exudate lesions as diagnostically useful morphological components. To obtain the 
      appropriate dictionaries, K-SVD dictionary learning algorithm is modified to use 
      a gated error which guides the process toward learning the main structures of the 
      retinal images using vessel or lesion maps. Computational efficiency of the 
      proposed framework is also increased significantly through some improvement 
      leading to noticeable reduction in run time. We experimentally show how effective 
      dictionaries can be learnt which help BAMCA to successfully separate exudate and 
      vessel components from retinal images even in severe cases of diabetic 
      retinopathy. In this paper, in addition to visual qualitative assessment, the 
      performance of the proposed method is quantitatively measured in the framework of 
      vessel and exudate segmentation. The reported experimental results on public 
      datasets demonstrate that the obtained components can be used to achieve 
      competitive results with regard to the state-of-the-art vessel and exudate 
      segmentation methods.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a visual complication of diabetes, which has become 
      one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the world. Exudate 
      detection is an important problem in automatic screening systems for detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy using color fundus photographs. In this paper, we present a 
      method for detection of exudates in color fundus photographs, which combines 
      several preprocessing and candidate extraction algorithms to increase the exudate 
      detection accuracy. The first stage of the method consists of an ensemble of 
      several exudate candidate extraction algorithms. In the learning phase, simulated 
      annealing is used to determine weights for combining the results of the ensemble 
      candidate extraction algorithms. The second stage of the method uses a machine 
      learning-based classification for detection of exudate regions. The experimental 
      validation was performed using the DRiDB color fundus image set. The validation 
      has demonstrated that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy in comparison 
      to state-of-the art methods.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality with 
      micrometer resolution which has been widely used for scanning the retina. Retinal 
      layers are important biomarkers for many diseases. Accurate automated algorithms 
      for segmenting smooth continuous layer surfaces with correct hierarchy (topology) 
      are important for automated retinal thickness and surface shape analysis. 
      State-of-the-art methods typically use a two step process. Firstly, a trained 
      classifier is used to label each pixel into either background and layers or 
      boundaries and non-boundaries. Secondly, the desired smooth surfaces with the 
      correct topology are extracted by graph methods (e.g., graph cut). Data driven 
      methods like deep networks have shown great ability for the pixel classification 
      step, but to date have not been able to extract structured smooth continuous 
      surfaces with topological constraints in the second step. In this paper, we 
      combine these two steps into a unified deep learning framework by directly 
      modeling the distribution of the surface positions. Smooth, continuous, and 
      topologically correct surfaces are obtained in a single feed forward operation. 
      The proposed method was evaluated on two publicly available data sets of healthy 
      controls and subjects with either multiple sclerosis or diabetic macular edema, 
      and is shown to achieve state-of-the art performance with sub-pixel accuracy.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among adults and the 
      numbers are projected to rise. There have been dramatic advances in the field of 
      retinal imaging since the first fundus image was captured by Jackman and Webster 
      in 1886. The currently available imaging modalities in the management of DR 
      include fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, autofluorescence imaging, 
      optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography, and 
      near-infrared reflectance imaging. These images are obtained using traditional 
      fundus cameras, widefield fundus cameras, handheld fundus cameras, or 
      smartphone-based fundus cameras. Fluorescence lifetime ophthalmoscopy, adaptive 
      optics, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, and multicolor imaging are the 
      evolving technologies which are being researched for their potential applications 
      in DR. Telemedicine has gained popularity in recent years as remote screening of 
      DR has been made possible. Retinal imaging technologies integrated with 
      artificial intelligence/deep-learning algorithms will likely be the way forward 
      in the screening and grading of DR. We provide an overview of the current and 
      upcoming imaging modalities which are relevant to the management of DR.

TI  - How Can Artificial Intelligence Be Implemented Effectively in Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Screening in Japan?
LID - 10.3390/medicina60020243 [doi]
LID - 243
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes, 
      affecting a substantial portion of diabetic patients worldwide. Timely 
      intervention is pivotal in mitigating the risk of blindness associated with DR, 
      yet early detection remains a challenge due to the absence of early symptoms. 
      Screening programs have emerged as a strategy to address this burden, and this 
      paper delves into the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing DR 
      screening in Japan. There are two pathways for DR screening in Japan: a health 
      screening pathway and a clinical referral path from physicians to 
      ophthalmologists. AI technologies that realize automated image classification by 
      applying deep learning are emerging. These technologies have exhibited 
      substantial promise, achieving sensitivity and specificity levels exceeding 90% 
      in prospective studies. Moreover, we introduce the potential of Generative AI and 
      large language models (LLMs) to transform healthcare delivery, particularly in 
      patient engagement, medical records, and decision support. Considering the use of 
      AI in DR screening in Japan, we propose to follow a seven-step framework for 
      systematic screening and emphasize the importance of integrating AI into a 
      well-designed screening program. Automated scoring systems with AI enhance 
      screening quality, but their effectiveness depends on their integration into the 
      broader screening ecosystem. LLMs emerge as an important tool to fill gaps in the 
      screening process, from personalized invitations to reporting results, 
      facilitating a seamless and efficient system. However, it is essential to address 
      concerns surrounding technical accuracy and governance before full-scale 
      integration into the healthcare system. In conclusion, this review highlights the 
      challenges in the current screening pathway and the potential for AI, 
      particularly LLM, to revolutionize DR screening in Japan. The future direction 
      will depend on leadership from ophthalmologists and stakeholders to address 
      long-standing challenges in DR screening so that all people have access to 
      accessible and effective screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered a pathology of retinal 
      vascular complications, which stays in the top causes of vision impairment and 
      blindness. Therefore, precisely inspecting its progression enables the 
      ophthalmologists to set up appropriate next-visit schedule and cost-effective 
      treatment plans. In the literature, existing work only makes use of numerical 
      attributes in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for acquiring such kind of 
      DR-oriented knowledge through conventional machine learning techniques, which 
      require an exhaustive job of engineering most impactful risk factors. OBJECTIVE: 
      In this paper, an approach of deep bimodal learning is introduced to leverage the 
      performance of DR risk progression identification. METHODS: In particular, we 
      further involve valuable clinical information of fundus photography in addition 
      to the aforementioned systemic attributes. Accordingly, a Trilogy of 
      Skip-connection Deep Networks, namely Tri-SDN, is proposed to exhaustively 
      exploit underlying relationships between the baseline and follow-up information 
      of the fundus images and EMR-based attributes. Besides that, we adopt 
      Skip-Connection Blocks as basis components of the Tri-SDN for making the 
      end-to-end flow of signals more efficient during feedforward and backpropagation 
      processes. RESULTS: Through a 10-fold cross validation strategy on a private 
      dataset of 96 diabetic mellitus patients, the proposed method attains superior 
      performance over the conventional EMR-modality learning approach in terms of 
      Accuracy (90.6%), Sensitivity (96.5%), Precision (88.7%), Specificity (82.1%), 
      and Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (88.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      experimental results show that the proposed Tri-SDN can combine features of 
      different modalities (i.e., fundus images and EMR-based numerical risk factors) 
      smoothly and effectively during training and testing processes, respectively. As 
      a consequence, with impressive performance of DR risk progression recognition, 
      the proposed approach is able to help the ophthalmologists properly decide 
      follow-up schedule and subsequent treatment plans.

AB  - The fovea centralis is an essential landmark in the retina where the 
      photoreceptor layer is entirely composed of cones responsible for sharp, central 
      vision. The localization of this anatomical landmark in optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) volumes is important for assessing visual function correlates 
      and treatment guidance in macular disease. In this study, the "PRE U-net" is 
      introduced as a novel approach for a fully automated fovea centralis detection, 
      addressing the localization as a pixel-wise regression task. 2D B-scans are 
      sampled from each image volume and are concatenated with spatial location 
      information to train the deep network. A total of 5586 OCT volumes from 1,541 
      eyes were used to train, validate and test the deep learning method. The test 
      data is comprised of healthy subjects and patients affected by neovascular 
      age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macula edema (DME) and macular 
      edema from retinal vein occlusion (RVO), covering the three major retinal 
      diseases responsible for blindness. Our experiments demonstrate that the PRE 
      U-net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the 
      robustness of automated localization, which is of value for clinical practice.

TI  - ResNet Based Deep Features and Random Forest Classifier for Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s21113883 [doi]
LID - 3883
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease commonly afflicting diabetic patients, can 
      result in loss of vision if prompt detection and treatment are not done in the 
      early stages. Once the symptoms are identified, the severity level of the disease 
      needs to be classified for prescribing the right medicine. This study proposes a 
      deep learning-based approach, for the classification and grading of diabetic 
      retinopathy images. The proposed approach uses the feature map of ResNet-50 and 
      passes it to Random Forest for classification. The proposed approach is compared 
      with five state-of-the-art approaches using two category Messidor-2 and five 
      category EyePACS datasets. These two categories on the Messidor-2 dataset include 
      'No Referable Diabetic Macular Edema Grade (DME)' and 'Referable DME' while five 
      categories consist of 'Proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'Severe', 'Moderate', 
      'Mild', and 'No diabetic retinopathy'. The results show that the proposed 
      approach outperforms compared approaches and achieves an accuracy of 96% and 
      75.09% for these datasets, respectively. The proposed approach outperforms six 
      existing state-of-the-art architectures, namely ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-v3, 
      MobileNet, Xception, and VGG16.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the applicability of deep learning image assessment software 
      VeriSee DR to different color fundus cameras for the screening of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Color fundus images of diabetes patients taken with 
      three different nonmydriatic fundus cameras, including 477 Topcon TRC-NW400, 459 
      Topcon TRC-NW8 series, and 471 Kowa nonmyd 8 series that were judged as 
      "gradable" by one ophthalmologist were enrolled for validation. VeriSee DR was 
      then used for the diagnosis of referable DR according to the International 
      Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. Gradability, sensitivity, 
      and specificity were calculated for each camera model. RESULTS: All images (100%) 
      from the three camera models were gradable for VeriSee DR. The sensitivity for 
      diagnosing referable DR in the TRC-NW400, TRC-NW8, and non-myd 8 series was 
      89.3%, 94.6%, and 95.7%, respectively, while the specificity was 94.2%, 90.4%, 
      and 89.3%, respectively. Neither the sensitivity nor the specificity differed 
      significantly between these camera models and the original camera model used for 
      VeriSee DR development (p = 0.40, p = 0.065, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VeriSee 
      DR was applicable to a variety of color fundus cameras with 100% agreement with 
      ophthalmologists in terms of gradability and good sensitivity and specificity for 
      the diagnosis of referable DR.

TI  - Computational Model for the Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in 2-D Color Fundus 
      Retina Scan.
LID - 10.2174/0115734056248183231010111937 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a growing problem in Asian countries. DR 
      accounts for 5% to 7% of all blindness in the entire area. In India, the record 
      of DR-affected patients will reach around 79.4 million by 2030. AIMS: The main 
      objective of the investigation is to utilize 2-D colored fundus retina scans to 
      determine if an individual possesses DR or not. In this regard, Engineering-based 
      techniques such as deep learning and neural networks play a methodical role in 
      fighting against this fatal disease. METHODS: In this research work, a 
      Computational Model for detecting DR using Convolutional Neural Network (DRCNN) 
      is proposed. This method contrasts the fundus retina scans of the DR-afflicted 
      eye with the usual human eyes. Using CNN and layers like Conv2D, Pooling, Dense, 
      Flatten, and Dropout, the model aids in comprehending the scan's curve and 
      color-based features. For training and error reduction, the Visual Geometry Group 
      (VGG-16) model and Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimizer are utilized. RESULTS: 
      The variations in a dataset like 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% images are reserved 
      for the training phase, and the rest images are reserved for the testing phase. 
      In the proposed model, the VGG-16 model comprises 138M parameters. The accuracy 
      is achieved maximum rate of 90% when the training dataset is reserved at 80%. The 
      model was validated using other datasets. CONCLUSION: The suggested contribution 
      to research determines conclusively whether the provided OCT scan utilizes an 
      effective method for detecting DRaffected individuals within just a few moments.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and patient 
      acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) screening model within endocrinology outpatient settings. Adults with 
      diabetes were recruited from two urban endocrinology outpatient clinics and 
      single-field, non-mydriatic fundus photographs were taken and graded for 
      referable DR ( ≥ pre-proliferative DR). Each participant underwent; (1) automated 
      screening model; where a deep learning algorithm (DLA) provided real-time 
      reporting of results; and (2) manual model where retinal images were transferred 
      to a retinal grading centre and manual grading outcomes were distributed to the 
      patient within 2 weeks of assessment. Participants completed a questionnaire on 
      the day of examination and 1-month following assessment to determine overall 
      satisfaction and the preferred model of care. In total, 96 participants were 
      screened for DR and the mean assessment time for automated screening was 
      6.9 minutes. Ninety-six percent of participants reported that they were either 
      satisfied or very satisfied with the automated screening model and 78% reported 
      that they preferred the automated model over manual. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of the DLA for correct referral was 92.3% and 93.7%, respectively. 
      AI-based DR screening in endocrinology outpatient settings appears to be feasible 
      and well accepted by patients.

TI  - Convolutional Network With Twofold Feature Augmentation for Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Recognition From Multi-Modal Images.
PG  - 2686-2697
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3041848 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the scenario of limited labeled dataset, this paper introduces a 
      deep learning-based approach that leverages Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity 
      recognition performance using fundus images combined with wide-field swept-source 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). METHODS: The proposed 
      architecture comprises a backbone convolutional network associated with a Twofold 
      Feature Augmentation mechanism, namely TFA-Net. The former includes multiple 
      convolution blocks extracting representational features at various scales. The 
      latter is constructed in a two-stage manner, i.e., the utilization of 
      weight-sharing convolution kernels and the deployment of a Reverse 
      Cross-Attention (RCA) stream. RESULTS: The proposed model achieves a Quadratic 
      Weighted Kappa rate of 90.2% on the small-sized internal KHUMC dataset. The 
      robustness of the RCA stream is also evaluated by the single-modal Messidor 
      dataset, of which the obtained mean Accuracy (94.8%) and Area Under Receiver 
      Operating Characteristic (99.4%) outperform those of the state-of-the-arts 
      significantly. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a network strongly regularized at feature 
      space to learn the amalgamation of different modalities is of proven 
      effectiveness. Thanks to the widespread availability of multi-modal retinal 
      imaging for each diabetes patient nowadays, such approach can reduce the heavy 
      reliance on large quantity of labeled visual data. SIGNIFICANCE: Our TFA-Net is 
      able to coordinate hybrid information of fundus photos and wide-field SS-OCTA for 
      exhaustively exploiting DR-oriented biomarkers. Moreover, the embedded 
      feature-wise augmentation scheme can enrich generalization ability efficiently 
      despite learning from small-scale labeled data.

TI  - Multithreshold Image Segmentation Technique Using Remora Optimization Algorithm 
      for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from Fundus Images.
PG  - 2363-2384
LID - 10.1007/s11063-021-10734-0 [doi]
AB  - One of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus is diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR), which produces lesions on the retina. A novel framework for DR detection 
      and classification was proposed in this study. The proposed work includes four 
      stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. 
      Initially, the image pre-processing is performed and after that, the Multi 
      threshold-based Remora Optimization (MTRO) algorithm performs the vessel 
      segmentation. The feature extraction and classification process are done by using 
      a Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) with Wild Geese Algorithm 
      (WGA). Finally, the proposed R-CNN with WGA effectively classifies the different 
      stages of DR including Non-DR, Proliferative DR, Severe, Moderate DR, Mild DR. 
      The experimental images were collected from the DRIVE database, and the proposed 
      framework exhibited superior DR detection performance. Compared to other existing 
      methods like fully convolutional deep neural network (FCDNN), genetic-search 
      feature selection (GSFS), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and deep learning 
      (DL) techniques, the proposed R-CNN with WGA provided 95.42% accuracy, 93.10% 
      specificity, 93.20% sensitivity, and 98.28% F-score results.

AB  - Purpose: We aim to present effective and computer aided diagnostics in the field 
      of ophthalmology and improve eye health. This study aims to create an automated 
      deep learning based system for categorizing fundus images into three classes: 
      normal, macular degeneration and tessellated fundus for the timely recognition 
      and treatment of diabetic retinopathy and other diseases. Methods: A total of 
      1,032 fundus images were collected from 516 patients using fundus camera from 
      Health Management Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital Shenzhen 
      University, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, China. Then, Inception V3 and ResNet-50 
      deep learning models are used to classify fundus images into three classes, 
      Normal, Macular degeneration and tessellated fundus for the timely recognition 
      and treatment of fundus diseases. Results: The experimental results show that the 
      effect of model recognition is the best when the Adam is used as optimizer 
      method, the number of iterations is 150, and 0.00 as the learning rate. According 
      to our proposed approach we, achieved the highest accuracy of 93.81% and 91.76% 
      by using ResNet-50 and Inception V3 after fine-tuned and adjusted hyper 
      parameters according to our classification problem. Conclusion: Our research 
      provides a reference to the clinical diagnosis or screening for diabetic 
      retinopathy and other eye diseases. Our suggested computer aided diagnostics 
      framework will prevent incorrect diagnoses caused by the low image quality and 
      individual experience, and other factors. In future implementations, the 
      ophthalmologists can implement more advanced learning algorithms to improve the 
      accuracy of diagnosis.

AB  - Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), its application in medical 
      imaging has been burdened and limited by expert-generated labels. We used images 
      from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging 
      modality that measures retinal blood flow, to train an AI algorithm to generate 
      flow maps from standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, exceeding the 
      ability and bypassing the need for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to 
      infer flow from single structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and 
      significantly better than expert clinicians (P < 0.00001). Our model allows 
      generating flow maps from large volumes of previously collected OCT data in 
      existing clinical trials and clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel 
      application of AI to medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between 
      different modalities are used to image the same body part and AI is used to 
      generate detailed inferences of tissue function from structure imaging.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis systems based on deep learning algorithms have shown 
      potential applications in rapid diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Due to 
      the superior performance of Transformer over convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
      on natural images, we attempted to develop a new model to classify referable DR 
      based on a limited number of large-size retinal images by using Transformer. 
      Vision Transformer (ViT) with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) was applied in this study 
      to improve the classification performance of referable DR. We collected over 
      100,000 publicly fundus retinal images larger than 224×224, and then pre-trained 
      ViT on these retinal images using MAE. The pre-trained ViT was applied to 
      classify referable DR, the performance was also compared with that of ViT 
      pre-trained using ImageNet. The improvement in model classification performance 
      by pre-training with over 100,000 retinal images using MAE is superior to that 
      pre-trained with ImageNet. The accuracy, area under curve (AUC), highest 
      sensitivity and highest specificity of the present model are 93.42%, 0.9853, 
      0.973 and 0.9539, respectively. This study shows that MAE can provide more 
      flexibility to the input image and substantially reduce the number of images 
      required. Meanwhile, the pretraining dataset scale in this study is much smaller 
      than ImageNet, and the pre-trained weights from ImageNet are not required also.

TI  - Digital solution for detection of undiagnosed diabetes using machine 
      learning-based retinal image analysis.

LID - e002914
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Undiagnosed diabetes is a global health issue. Previous studies 
      have estimated that about 24.1%-75.1% of all diabetes cases are undiagnosed, 
      leading to more diabetic complications and inducing huge healthcare costs. Many 
      current methods for diabetes diagnosis rely on metabolic indices and are subject 
      to considerable variability. In contrast, a digital approach based on retinal 
      image represents a stable marker of overall glycemic status. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Our study involves 2221 subjects for developing a classification model, 
      with 945 subjects with diabetes and 1276 controls. The training data included 70% 
      and the testing data 30% of the subjects. All subjects had their retinal images 
      taken using a non-mydriatic fundus camera. Two separate data sets were used for 
      external validation. The Hong Kong testing data contain 734 controls without 
      diabetes and 660 subjects with diabetes, and the UK testing data have 1682 
      subjects with diabetes. RESULTS: The 10-fold cross-validation using the support 
      vector machine approach has a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96.2%. The 
      separate testing data from Hong Kong provided a sensitivity of 99.5% and a 
      specificity of 91.1%. For the UK testing data, the sensitivity is 98.0%. The 
      accuracy of the Caucasian retinal images is comparable with that of the Asian 
      data. It implies that the digital method can be applied globally. Those with 
      diabetes complications in both Hong Kong and UK data have a higher probability of 
      risk of diabetes compared with diabetes subjects without complications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A digital machine learning-based method to estimate the risk of 
      diabetes based on retinal images has been developed and validated using both 
      Asian and Caucasian data. Retinal image analysis is a fast, convenient, and 
      non-invasive technique for community health applications. In addition, it is an 
      ideal solution for undiagnosed diabetes prescreening.

LID - 6644071
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main causes of blindness in human eyes, and 
      lesion segmentation is an important basic work for the diagnosis of diabetic 
      retinopathy. Due to the small lesion areas scattered in fundus images, it is 
      laborious to segment the lesion of diabetic retinopathy effectively with the 
      existing U-Net model. In this paper, we proposed a new lesion segmentation model 
      named FFU-Net (Feature Fusion U-Net) that enhances U-Net from the following 
      points. Firstly, the pooling layer in the network is replaced with a 
      convolutional layer to reduce spatial loss of the fundus image. Then, we 
      integrate multiscale feature fusion (MSFF) block into the encoders which helps 
      the network to learn multiscale features efficiently and enrich the information 
      carried with skip connection and lower-resolution decoder by fusing contextual 
      channel attention (CCA) models. Finally, in order to solve the problems of data 
      imbalance and misclassification, we present a Balanced Focal Loss function. In 
      the experiments on benchmark dataset IDRID, we make an ablation study to verify 
      the effectiveness of each component and compare FFU-Net against several 
      state-of-the-art models. In comparison with baseline U-Net, FFU-Net improves the 
      segmentation performance by 11.97%, 10.68%, and 5.79% on metrics SEN, IOU, and 
      DICE, respectively. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the 
      superiority of our FFU-Net in the task of lesion segmentation of diabetic 
      retinopathy.

TI  - A Lesion-Fusion Neural Network for Multi-View Diabetic Retinopathy Grading.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2024.3384251 [doi]
AB  - As the most common complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of 
      the main causes of irreversible blindness. Automatic DR grading plays a crucial 
      role in early diagnosis and intervention, reducing the risk of vision loss in 
      people with diabetes. In these years, various deep-learning approaches for DR 
      grading have been proposed. Most previous DR grading models are trained using the 
      dataset of single-field fundus images, but the entire retina cannot be fully 
      visualized in a single field of view. There are also problems of scattered 
      location and great differences in the appearance of lesions in fundus images. To 
      address the limitations caused by incomplete fundus features, and the difficulty 
      in obtaining lesion information. This work introduces a novel multi-view DR 
      grading framework, which solves the problem of incomplete fundus features by 
      jointly learning fundus images from multiple fields of view. Furthermore, the 
      proposed model combines multi-view inputs such as fundus images and lesion 
      snapshots. It utilizes heterogeneous convolution blocks (HCB) and scalable 
      self-attention classes (SSAC), which enhance the ability of the model to obtain 
      lesion information. The experimental results show that our proposed method 
      performs better than the benchmark methods on the large-scale dataset.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious retinal disease and is considered as a 
      leading cause of blindness in the world. Ophthalmologists use optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) and fundus photography for the purpose of assessing the retinal 
      thickness, and structure, in addition to detecting edema, hemorrhage, and scars. 
      Deep learning models are mainly used to analyze OCT or fundus images, extract 
      unique features for each stage of DR and therefore classify images and stage the 
      disease. Throughout this paper, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 18 
      convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers is proposed to analyze fundus 
      images and automatically distinguish between controls (i.e. no DR), moderate DR 
      (i.e. a combination of mild and moderate Non Proliferative DR (NPDR)) and severe 
      DR (i.e. a group of severe NPDR, and Proliferative DR (PDR)) with a validation 
      accuracy of 88%-89%, a sensitivity of 87%-89%, a specificity of 94%-95%, and a 
      Quadratic Weighted Kappa Score of 0.91-0.92 when both 5-fold, and 10-fold cross 
      validation methods were used respectively. A prior pre-processing stage was 
      deployed where image resizing and a class-specific data augmentation were used. 
      The proposed approach is considerably accurate in objectively diagnosing and 
      grading diabetic retinopathy, which obviates the need for a retina specialist and 
      expands access to retinal care. This technology enables both early diagnosis and 
      objective tracking of disease progression which may help optimize medical therapy 
      to minimize vision loss.

TI  - Compound Scaling Encoder-Decoder (CoSED) Network for Diabetic Retinopathy Related 
      Bio-marker Detection.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3313785 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical image segmentation plays an important role in Diabetic Retinopathy 
      (DR)-related biomarker detection. DR is an ocular disease that affects the retina 
      in people with diabetes and could lead to visual impairment if management 
      measures are not taken in a timely manner. In DR screening programs, the presence 
      and severity of DR are identified and classified based on various microvascular 
      lesions detected by qualified ophthalmic screeners. Such a detection process is 
      time-consuming and error-prone, given the small size of the microvascular lesions 
      and the volume of images, especially with the increasing prevalence of diabetes. 
      Automated image processing using deep learning methods is recognized as a 
      promising approach to support diabetic retinopathy screening. In this paper, we 
      propose a novel compound scaling encoder-decoder network architecture to improve 
      the accuracy and running efficiency of microvascular lesion segmentation. In the 
      encoder phase, we develop a lightweight encoder to speed up the training process, 
      where the encoder network is scaled up in depth, width, and resolution 
      dimensions. In the decoder phase, an attention mechanism is introduced to yield 
      higher accuracy. Specifically, we employ Concurrent Spatial and Channel Squeeze 
      and Channel Excitation (scSE) blocks to fully utilise both spatial and 
      channel-wise information. Additionally, a compound loss function is incorporated 
      with transfer learning to handle the problem of imbalanced data and further 
      improve performance. To assess performance, our method is evaluated on two 
      large-scale lesion segmentation datasets: DDR and FGADR datasets. Experimental 
      results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other competent 
      methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/DeweiYi/CoSED-Net.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes, which if untreated leads 
      to blindness. DR early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes. Automated 
      assessment of single lesions associated with DR has been investigated for 
      sometime. To improve on classification, especially across different ethnic 
      groups, we present an approach using points-of-interest and visual dictionary 
      that contains important features required to identify retinal pathology. 
      Variation in images of the human retina with respect to differences in 
      pigmentation and presence of diverse lesions can be analyzed without the 
      necessity of preprocessing and utilizing different training sets to account for 
      ethnic differences for instance.

TI  - Deep-Ocular: Improved Transfer Learning Architecture Using Self-Attention and 
      Dense Layers for Recognition of Ocular Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13203165 [doi]
LID - 3165
AB  - It is difficult for clinicians or less-experienced ophthalmologists to detect 
      early eye-related diseases. By hand, eye disease diagnosis is labor-intensive, 
      prone to mistakes, and challenging because of the variety of ocular diseases such 
      as glaucoma (GA), diabetic retinopathy (DR), cataract (CT), and normal 
      eye-related diseases (NL). An automated ocular disease detection system with 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools is required to recognize eye-related 
      diseases. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) algorithms enhance the classification 
      results of retinograph images. To address these issues, we developed an 
      intelligent detection system based on retinal fundus images. To create this 
      system, we used ODIR and RFMiD datasets, which included various retinographics of 
      distinct classes of the fundus, using cutting-edge image classification 
      algorithms like ensemble-based transfer learning. In this paper, we suggest a 
      three-step hybrid ensemble model that combines a classifier, a feature extractor, 
      and a feature selector. The original image features are first extracted using a 
      pre-trained AlexNet model with an enhanced structure. The improved AlexNet 
      (iAlexNet) architecture with attention and dense layers offers enhanced feature 
      extraction, task adaptability, interpretability, and potential accuracy benefits 
      compared to other transfer learning architectures, making it particularly suited 
      for tasks like retinograph classification. The extracted features are then 
      selected using the ReliefF method, and then the most crucial elements are chosen 
      to minimize the feature dimension. Finally, an XgBoost classifier offers 
      classification outcomes based on the desired features. These classifications 
      represent different ocular illnesses. We utilized data augmentation techniques to 
      control class imbalance issues. The deep-ocular model, based mainly on the 
      AlexNet-ReliefF-XgBoost model, achieves an accuracy of 95.13%. The results 
      indicate the proposed ensemble model can assist dermatologists in making early 
      decisions for the diagnosing and screening of eye-related diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a neurovascular disease, is a leading 
      cause of visual loss worldwide and severely affects quality of life. Several 
      studies have shown that ferroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis 
      of DR; however, its molecule mechanism remains incompletely elucidated. Hence, 
      this study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis of ferroptosis and explore 
      potential ferroptosis-related gene biomarkers and a pharmacological compound for 
      treating DR. METHODS: Ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were identified in the GSE102485 dataset. Functional enrichment analyses were 
      then performed and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to 
      screen candidates of ferroptosis-related hub genes (FRHGs). FRHGs were further 
      screened based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
      regression and random forest algorithms, and were then validated with the 
      GSE60436 dataset and previous studies. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve monofactor analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 
      the FRHGs, and immune infiltration analysis was performed. Moreover, the 
      pharmacological compound targeting the FRHGs were verified by molecular docking. 
      Finally, the FRHGs were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: The 40 ferroptosis-related DEGs were 
      extracted, and functional enrichment analyses mainly implicated apoptotic 
      signaling, response to oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and lipid and 
      atherosclerosis pathways. By integrating the PPI, LASSO regression, and random 
      forest analyses to screen the FRHGs, and through validation, we identified five 
      FRHGs that performed well in the diagnosis (CAV1, CD44, NOX4, TLR4, and TP53). 
      Immune infiltration analysis revealed that immune microenvironment changes in DR 
      patients may be related to these five FRHGs. Molecular docking also showed that 
      glutathione strongly bound the CAV1 and TLR4 proteins. Finally, the upregulated 
      expression of FRHGs (CD44, NOX4, TLR4, and TP53) was validated by qRT-PCR 
      analysis in human retinal capillary endothelial cells cultured under high-glucose 
      environment. CONCLUSIONS: CAV1, CD44, NOX4, TLR4, and TP53 are potential 
      biomarkers for DR and may be involved in its occurrence and progression by 
      regulating ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment. Further, glutathione 
      exhibits potential therapeutic efficacy on DR by targeting ferroptosis. Our study 
      provides new insights into the ferroptosis-related pathogenesis of DR, as well as 
      its diagnosis and treatment.

      Patients Based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is vision impairment and a life-threatening condition 
      for diabetic patients. Especially type II diabetic people have higher chances of 
      getting retinal problems. Hence, early prediction of DR is necessary for 
      preventing the diabetic patients from vision impairment. The main aim of this 
      feasibility study is to identify the most critical risk features that could lead 
      to diabetic retinopathy. This study investigated type II diabetic patients' 
      socio-analytical, diabetes, behavioral, and clinical risk factors. We conducted a 
      self-individual questionnaire session for all participants. Our questionnaire 
      asked about the reliability of results, feeling comfortable during the screening 
      test, willingness to participate in future screenings, overall perspective, and 
      satisfaction with the DR screening test. We proposed a random forest model for 
      predicting the prevalence of DR risk among diabetics. Further explanations of the 
      model were conducted using more robust SHAP eXplainable Artificial Intelligence 
      (XAI) tools. The SHAP method makes it possible to understand how input variables 
      interact with their representative output records, as well as how input variables 
      are ranked. In addition, various descriptive and inferential statistical analyses 
      were performed on the data and evaluated the significant relationship between the 
      factors discussed above via hypothesis testing. This feasibility study involved 
      172 type II diabetic patients (73 males and 99 females). Therefore, we found that 
      81 (47.09%) out of 172 participants had referable DR. The average age of the 
      patients was determined as 55.08, with a standard deviation of ± 9.770 (ranging 
      from 40 to 79). Type II patients were affected by mild, moderate, severe, and 
      advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) stages with 23.83%, 13.95%, 
      5.81%, and 3.48%, respectively, of the total samples. The developed RF model 
      obtained high accuracy of 94.9% using clinical dataset. Our results showed that 
      the formation of tiny microminiature lesions was noticeable in type II diabetic 
      patients with aged people, abnormal blood glucose levels, and prolonged diabetes 
      duration.

AB  - Estimated blind people in the world will exceed 40 million by 2025. To develop 
      novel algorithms based on fundus image descriptors that allow the automatic 
      classification of retinal tissue into healthy and pathological in early stages is 
      necessary. In this paper, we focus on one of the most common pathologies in the 
      current society: diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method avoids the necessity 
      of lesion segmentation or candidate map generation before the classification 
      stage. Local binary patterns and granulometric profiles are locally computed to 
      extract texture and morphological information from retinal images. Different 
      combinations of this information feed classification algorithms to optimally 
      discriminate bright and dark lesions from healthy tissues. Through several 
      experiments, the ability of the proposed system to identify diabetic retinopathy 
      signs is validated using different public databases with a large degree of 
      variability and without image exclusion.

AB  - Vision loss happens due to diabetic retinopathy (DR) in severe stages. Thus, an 
      automatic detection method applied to diagnose DR in an earlier phase may help 
      medical doctors to make better decisions. DR is considered one of the main risks, 
      leading to blindness. Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems play an essential role in 
      detecting features in fundus images. Fundus images may include blood vessels, 
      exudates, micro-aneurysm, hemorrhages, and neovascularization. In this paper, our 
      model combines automatic detection for the diabetic retinopathy classification 
      with localization methods depending on weakly-supervised learning. The model has 
      four stages; in stage one, various preprocessing techniques are applied to smooth 
      the data set. In stage two, the network had gotten deeply to the optic disk 
      segment for eliminating any exudate's false prediction because the exudates had 
      the same color pixel as the optic disk. In stage three, the network is fed 
      through training data to classify each label. Finally, the layers of the 
      convolution neural network are re-edited, and used to localize the impact of DR 
      on the patient's eye. The framework tackles the matching technique between two 
      essential concepts where the classification problem depends on the supervised 
      learning method. While the localization problem was obtained by the weakly 
      supervised method. An additional layer known as weakly supervised sensitive heat 
      map (WSSH) was added to detect the ROI of the lesion at a test accuracy of 
      98.65%, while comparing with Class Activation Map that involved weakly supervised 
      technology achieved 0.954. The main purpose is to learn a representation that 
      collect the central localization of discriminative features in a retina image. 
      CNN-WSSH model is able to highlight decisive features in a single forward pass 
      for getting the best detection of lesions.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a pathological change of the retina that occurs for 
      long-term diabetes. The patients become symptomatic in advanced stages of 
      diabetic retinopathy resulting in severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
      or proliferative diabetic retinopathy stages. There is a need of an automated 
      screening tool for the early detection and treatment of patients with diabetic 
      retinopathy. This paper focuses on the segmentation of red lesions using nested 
      U-Net Zhou et al. (Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal 
      Learning for Clinical Decision Support, Springer, 2018) followed by removal of 
      false positives based on the sub-image classification method. Different sizes of 
      sub-images were studied for the reduction in false positives in the sub-image 
      classification method. The network could capture semantic features and fine 
      details due to dense convolutional blocks connected via skip connections in 
      between down sampling and up sampling paths. False-negative candidates were very 
      few and the sub-image classification network effectively reduced the falsely 
      detected candidates. The proposed framework achieves a sensitivity of [Formula: 
      see text], precision of [Formula: see text], and F1-Score of [Formula: see text] 
      for the DIARETDB1 data set Kalviainen and Uusutalo (Medical Image Understanding 
      and Analysis, Citeseer, 2007). It outperforms the state-of-the-art networks such 
      as U-Net Ronneberger et al. (International Conference on Medical Image Computing 
      and Computer-Assisted Intervention, Springer, 2015) and attention U-Net Oktay et 
      al. (Attention u-net: Learning where to look for the pancreas, 2018).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence and automated technology were first reported 
      more than 70 years ago and nowadays provide unprecedented diagnostic accuracy, 
      screening capacity, risk stratification, and workflow optimization. Diabetic 
      retinopathy is an important cause of preventable blindness worldwide, and 
      artificial intelligence technology provides precocious diagnosis, monitoring, and 
      guide treatment. High-quality exams are fundamental in supervised artificial 
      intelligence algorithms, but the lack of ground truth standards in retinal exams 
      datasets is a problem. MAIN BODY: In this article, ETDRS, NHS, ICDR, SDGS 
      diabetic retinopathy grading, and manual annotation are described and compared in 
      publicly available datasets. The various DR labeling systems generate a 
      fundamental problem for AI datasets. Possible solutions are standardization of DR 
      classification and direct retinal-finding identifications. CONCLUSION: Reliable 
      labeling methods also need to be considered in datasets with more trustworthy 
      labeling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differential artery-vein (AV) analysis in optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA) holds promise for the early detection of eye 
      diseases. However, currently available methods for AV analysis are limited for 
      binary processing of retinal vasculature in OCTA, without quantitative 
      information of vascular perfusion intensity. This study is to develop and 
      validate a method for quantitative AV analysis of vascular perfusion intensity. 
      METHOD: A deep learning network AVA-Net has been developed for automated AV area 
      (AVA) segmentation in OCTA. Seven new OCTA features, including arterial area 
      (AA), venous area (VA), AVA ratio (AVAR), total perfusion intensity density 
      (T-PID), arterial PID (A-PID), venous PID (V-PID), and arterial-venous PID ratio 
      (AV-PIDR), were extracted and tested for early detection of diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). Each of these seven features was evaluated for quantitative evaluation of 
      OCTA images from healthy controls, diabetic patients without DR (NoDR), and mild 
      DR. RESULTS: It was observed that the area features, i.e., AA, VA and AVAR, can 
      reveal significant differences between the control and mild DR. Vascular 
      perfusion parameters, including T-PID and A-PID, can differentiate mild DR from 
      control group. AV-PIDR can disclose significant differences among all three 
      groups, i.e., control, NoDR, and mild DR. According to Bonferroni correction, the 
      combination of A-PID and AV-PIDR can reveal significant differences in all three 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: AVA-Net, which is available on GitHub for open access, 
      enables quantitative AV analysis of AV area and vascular perfusion intensity. 
      Comparative analysis revealed AV-PIDR as the most sensitive feature for OCTA 
      detection of early DR. Ensemble AV feature analysis, e.g., the combination of 
      A-PID and AV-PIDR, can further improve the performance for early DR assessment.

OAB - Some people with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy, in which the blood flow 
      through the eye changes, resulting in damage to the back of the eye, called the 
      retina. Changes in blood flow can be measured by imaging the eye using a method 
      called optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The authors developed a 
      computer program named AVA-Net that determines changes in blood flow through the 
      eye from OCTA images. The program was tested on images from people with healthy 
      eyes, people with diabetes but no eye disease, and people with mild diabetic 
      retinopathy. Their program found differences between these groups and so could be 
      used to improve diagnosis of people with diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Diabetes retinopathy prevention necessitates early detection, monitoring, and 
      treatment. Non-invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows structural 
      changes in the retinal layer. OCT image evaluation necessitates retinal layer 
      segmentation. The ability of our automated retinal layer segmentation to 
      distinguish between normal, non-proliferative (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy (PDR) was investigated in this study using quantifiable biomarkers 
      such as retina layer smoothness index (SI) and area (S) in horizontal and 
      vertical OCT images for each zone (fovea, superior, inferior, nasal, and 
      temporal). This research includes 84 eyes from 57 individuals. The study shows a 
      significant difference in the Area (S) of inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer 
      nuclear layer (ONL) in the horizontal foveal zone across the three groups 
      (p < 0.001). In the horizontal scan, there is a significant difference in the 
      smoothness index (SI) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and the upper border of 
      the outer plexiform layer (OPL) among three groups (p < 0.05). There is also a 
      significant difference in the area (S) of the OPL in the foveal zone among the 
      three groups (p = 0.003). The area (S) of the INL in the foveal region of 
      horizontal slabs performed best for distinguishing diabetic patients (NPDR and 
      PDR) from normal individuals, with an accuracy of 87.6%. The smoothness index 
      (SI) of IPL in the nasal zone of horizontal foveal slabs was the most accurate at 
      97.2% in distinguishing PDR from NPDR. The smoothness index of the top border of 
      the OPL in the nasal zone of horizontal slabs was 84.1% accurate in 
      distinguishing NPDR from PDR. Smoothness index of IPL in the temporal zone of 
      horizontal slabs was 89.8% accurate in identifying NPDR from PDR patients. In 
      conclusion, optical coherence tomography can assess the smoothness index and 
      irregularity of the inner and outer plexiform layers, particularly in the nasal 
      and temporal regions of horizontal foveal slabs, to distinguish non-proliferative 
      from proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The evolution of diabetic retinopathy 
      throughout severity levels and its effects on retinal layer irregularity need 
      more study.

TI  - AOSLO-net: A Deep Learning-Based Method for Automatic Segmentation of Retinal 
      Microaneurysms From Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy Images.
PG  - 7

AB  - PURPOSE: Accurate segmentation of microaneurysms (MAs) from adaptive optics 
      scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) images is crucial for identifying MA 
      morphologies and assessing the hemodynamics inside the MAs. Herein, we introduce 
      AOSLO-net to perform automatic MA segmentation from AOSLO images of diabetic 
      retinas. METHOD: AOSLO-net is composed of a deep neural network based on UNet 
      with a pretrained EfficientNet as the encoder. We have designed customized 
      preprocessing and postprocessing policies for AOSLO images, including generation 
      of multichannel images, de-noising, contrast enhancement, ensemble and union of 
      model predictions, to optimize the MA segmentation. AOSLO-net is trained and 
      tested using 87 MAs imaged from 28 eyes of 20 subjects with varying severity of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is the largest available AOSLO dataset for MA 
      detection. To avoid the overfitting in the model training process, we augment the 
      training data by flipping, rotating, scaling the original image to increase the 
      diversity of data available for model training. RESULTS: The validity of the 
      model is demonstrated by the good agreement between the predictions of AOSLO-net 
      and the MA masks generated by ophthalmologists and skillful trainees on 87 
      patient-specific MA images. Our results show that AOSLO-net outperforms the 
      state-of-the-art segmentation model (nnUNet) both in accuracy (e.g., intersection 
      over union and Dice scores), as well as computational cost. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      demonstrate that AOSLO-net provides high-quality of MA segmentation from AOSLO 
      images that enables correct MA morphological classification. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: As the first attempt to automatically segment retinal MAs from AOSLO 
      images, AOSLO-net could facilitate the pathological study of DR and help 
      ophthalmologists make disease prognoses.

TI  - CSANet: a lightweight channel and spatial attention neural network for grading 
      diabetic retinopathy with optical coherence tomography angiography.
PG  - 1820-1834
LID - 10.21037/qims-23-1270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common eye diseases. 
      Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be a powerful tool for 
      learning DR features; however, accurate DR grading remains challenging due to the 
      small lesions in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images and the 
      small number of samples. METHODS: In this article, we developed a novel 
      deep-learning framework to achieve the fine-grained classification of DR; that 
      is, the lightweight channel and spatial attention network (CSANet). Our CSANet 
      comprises two modules: the baseline model, and the hybrid attention module (HAM) 
      based on spatial attention and channel attention. The spatial attention module is 
      used to mine small lesions and obtain a set of spatial position weights to 
      address the problem of small lesions being ignored during the convolution 
      process. The channel attention module uses a set of channel weights to focus on 
      useful features and suppress irrelevant features. RESULTS: The extensive 
      experimental results for the OCTA-DR and diabetic retinopathy analysis challenge 
      (DRAC) 2022 data sets showed that the CSANet achieved state-of-the-art DR grading 
      results, showing the effectiveness of the proposed model. The CSANet had an 
      accuracy rate of 97.41% for the OCTA-DR data set and 85.71% for the DRAC 2022 
      data set. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive experiments using the OCTA-DR and DRAC 2022 data 
      sets showed that the proposed model effectively mitigated the problems of mutual 
      confusion between DRs of different severity and small lesions being neglected in 
      the convolution process, and thus improved the accuracy of DR classification.

AB  - An accurate segmentation and quantification of the superficial foveal avascular 
      zone (sFAZ) is important to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of many 
      retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. We 
      proposed a method based on deep learning for the automatic segmentation and 
      quantification of the sFAZ in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) 
      images with robustness to brightness and contrast (B/C) variations. A dataset of 
      405 OCTA images from 45 participants was acquired with Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 
      and the ground truth (GT) was manually segmented subsequently. A deep learning 
      network with an encoder-decoder architecture was created to classify each pixel 
      into an sFAZ or non-sFAZ class. Subsequently, we applied largest-connected-region 
      extraction and hole-filling to fine-tune the automatic segmentation results. A 
      maximum mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.976 ± 0.011 was obtained when 
      the automatic segmentation results were compared against the GT. The correlation 
      coefficient between the area calculated from the automatic segmentation results 
      and that calculated from the GT was 0.997. In all nine parameter groups with 
      various brightness/contrast, all the DSCs of the proposed method were higher than 
      0.96. The proposed method achieved better performance in the sFAZ segmentation 
      and quantification compared to two previously reported methods. In conclusion, we 
      proposed and successfully verified an automatic sFAZ segmentation and 
      quantification method based on deep learning with robustness to B/C variations. 
      For clinical applications, this is an important progress in creating an automated 
      segmentation and quantification applicable to clinical analysis.

TI  - Automatic Detection and Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Using the Improved 
      Pooling Function in the Convolution Neural Network.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13152606 [doi]
LID - 2606
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with diabetes that can 
      lead to blindness. Early diagnosis is critical to ensure that patients with 
      diabetes are not affected by blindness. Deep learning plays an important role in 
      diagnosing diabetes, reducing the human effort to diagnose and classify diabetic 
      and non-diabetic patients. The main objective of this study was to provide an 
      improved convolution neural network (CNN) model for automatic DR diagnosis from 
      fundus images. The pooling function increases the receptive field of convolution 
      kernels over layers. It reduces computational complexity and memory requirements 
      because it reduces the resolution of feature maps while preserving the essential 
      characteristics required for subsequent layer processing. In this study, an 
      improved pooling function combined with an activation function in the ResNet-50 
      model was applied to the retina images in autonomous lesion detection with 
      reduced loss and processing time. The improved ResNet-50 model was trained and 
      tested over the two datasets (i.e., APTOS and Kaggle). The proposed model 
      achieved an accuracy of 98.32% for APTOS and 98.71% for Kaggle datasets. It is 
      proven that the proposed model has produced greater accuracy when compared to 
      their state-of-the-art work in diagnosing DR with retinal fundus images.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique with 
      extensive clinical applications in ophthalmology. OCT enables the visualization 
      of the retinal layers, playing a vital role in the early detection and monitoring 
      of retinal diseases. OCT uses the principle of light wave interference to create 
      detailed images of the retinal microstructures, making it a valuable tool for 
      diagnosing ocular conditions. This work presents an open-access OCT dataset 
      (OCTDL) comprising over 2000 OCT images labeled according to disease group and 
      retinal pathology. The dataset consists of OCT records of patients with 
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Epiretinal 
      Membrane (ERM), Retinal Artery Occlusion (RAO), Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), and 
      Vitreomacular Interface Disease (VID). The images were acquired with an Optovue 
      Avanti RTVue XR using raster scanning protocols with dynamic scan length and 
      image resolution. Each retinal b-scan was acquired by centering on the fovea and 
      interpreted and cataloged by an experienced retinal specialist. In this work, we 
      applied Deep Learning classification techniques to this new open-access dataset.

AB  - Retinopathy screening is a non-invasive method to collect retinal images and 
      neovascularization detection from retinal images plays a significant role on the 
      identification and classification of diabetes retinopathy. In this paper, an 
      automatic parallel detection framework for neovascularization with color retinal 
      images using ensemble of extreme learning machine is proposed. The framework 
      employs two Map-Reduce Jobs to extract features and trains Extreme Learning 
      Machine models. Ensemble methods such as bagging, subspace partitioning and cross 
      validating are used to increase the accuracy. The framework is evaluated with 
      retinal images from MESSIDOR database. Experimental results show the framework 
      can improve the detection accuracy, as well as speedup the processing time to 22 
      times on average.

AB  - Accurate diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading is crucial for making the proper 
      treatment plan to reduce the damage caused by vision loss. This task is 
      challenging due to the fact that the DR related lesions are often small and 
      subtle in visual differences and intra-class variations. Moreover, relationships 
      between the lesions and the DR levels are complicated. Although many deep 
      learning (DL) DR grading systems have been developed with some success, there are 
      still rooms for grading accuracy improvement. A common issue is that not much 
      medical knowledge was used in these DL DR grading systems. As a result, the 
      grading results are not properly interpreted by ophthalmologists, thus hinder the 
      potential for practical applications. This paper proposes a novel fine-grained 
      attention & knowledge-based collaborative network (FA+KC-Net) to address this 
      concern. The fine-grained attention network dynamically divides the extracted 
      feature maps into smaller patches and effectively captures small image features 
      that are meaningful in the sense of its training from large amount of retinopathy 
      fundus images. The knowledge-based collaborative network extracts a-priori 
      medical knowledge features, i.e., lesions such as the microaneurysms (MAs), soft 
      exudates (SEs), hard exudates (EXs), and hemorrhages (HEs). Finally, decision 
      rules are developed to fuse the DR grading results from the fine-grained network 
      and the knowledge-based collaborative network to make the final grading. 
      Extensive experiments are carried out on four widely-used datasets, the DDR, 
      Messidor, APTOS, and EyePACS to evaluate the efficacy of our method and compare 
      with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models. Simulation results show that 
      proposed FA+KC-Net is accurate and stable, achieves the best performances on the 
      DDR, Messidor, and APTOS datasets.

      retinopathy.
PG  - 41-57
LID - 10.1007/s13534-017-0047-y [doi]
AB  - The high-pace rise in advanced computing and imaging systems has given rise to a 
      new research dimension called computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for various 
      biomedical purposes. CAD-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be of paramount 
      significance to enable early disease detection and diagnosis decision. 
      Considering the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) to solve highly 
      intricate classification problems, in this paper, AlexNet DNN, which functions on 
      the basis of convolutional neural network (CNN), has been applied to enable an 
      optimal DR CAD solution. The DR model applies a multilevel optimization measure 
      that incorporates pre-processing, adaptive-learning-based Gaussian mixture model 
      (GMM)-based concept region segmentation, connected component-analysis-based 
      region of interest (ROI) localization, AlexNet DNN-based highly dimensional 
      feature extraction, principle component analysis (PCA)- and linear discriminant 
      analysis (LDA)-based feature selection, and support-vector-machine-based 
      classification to ensure optimal five-class DR classification. The simulation 
      results with standard KAGGLE fundus datasets reveal that the proposed AlexNet 
      DNN-based DR exhibits a better performance with LDA feature selection, where it 
      exhibits a DR classification accuracy of 97.93% with FC7 features, whereas with 
      PCA, it shows 95.26% accuracy. Comparative analysis with spatial invariant 
      feature transform (SIFT) technique (accuracy-94.40%) based DR feature extraction 
      also confirms that AlexNet DNN-based DR outperforms SIFT-based DR.

LID - 10.1167/tvst.9.2.29 [doi]

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) could 
      synthesize realistic optical coherence tomography (OCT) images that 
      satisfactorily serve as the educational images for retinal specialists, and the 
      training datasets for the classification of various retinal disorders using deep 
      learning (DL). METHODS: The GANs architecture was adopted to synthesize 
      high-resolution OCT images trained on a publicly available OCT dataset, including 
      urgent referrals (37,206 OCT images from eyes with choroidal neovascularization, 
      and 11,349 OCT images from eyes with diabetic macular edema) and nonurgent 
      referrals (8617 OCT images from eyes with drusen, and 51,140 OCT images from 
      normal eyes). Four hundred real and synthetic OCT images were evaluated by two 
      retinal specialists (with over 10 years of clinical retinal experience) to assess 
      image quality. We further trained two DL models on either real or synthetic 
      datasets and compared the performance of urgent versus nonurgent referrals 
      diagnosis tested on a local (1000 images from the public dataset) and clinical 
      validation dataset (278 images from Shanghai Shibei Hospital). RESULTS: The image 
      quality of real versus synthetic OCT images was similar as assessed by two 
      retinal specialists. The accuracy of discrimination of real versus synthetic OCT 
      images was 59.50% for retinal specialist 1 and 53.67% for retinal specialist 2. 
      For the local dataset, the DL model trained on real (DL_Model_R) and synthetic 
      OCT images (DL_Model_S) had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, and 0.98, 
      respectively. For the clinical dataset, the AUC was 0.94 for DL_Model_R and 0.90 
      for DL_Model_S. CONCLUSIONS: The GAN synthetic OCT images can be used by 
      clinicians for educational purposes and for developing DL algorithms. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The medical image synthesis based on GANs is promising 
      in humans and machines to fulfill clinical tasks.

TI  - Aiding the Diagnosis of Diabetic and Hypertensive Retinopathy Using Artificial 
      Intelligence-Based Semantic Segmentation.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8091446 [doi]
LID - 1446
AB  - Automatic segmentation of retinal images is an important task in 
      computer-assisted medical image analysis for the diagnosis of diseases such as 
      hypertension, diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy, and arteriosclerosis. Among 
      the diseases, diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of vision 
      detachment, can be diagnosed early through the detection of retinal vessels. The 
      manual detection of these retinal vessels is a time-consuming process that can be 
      automated with the help of artificial intelligence with deep learning. The 
      detection of vessels is difficult due to intensity variation and noise from 
      non-ideal imaging. Although there are deep learning approaches for vessel 
      segmentation, these methods require many trainable parameters, which increase the 
      network complexity. To address these issues, this paper presents a 
      dual-residual-stream-based vessel segmentation network (Vess-Net), which is not 
      as deep as conventional semantic segmentation networks, but provides good 
      segmentation with few trainable parameters and layers. The method takes advantage 
      of artificial intelligence for semantic segmentation to aid the diagnosis of 
      retinopathy. To evaluate the proposed Vess-Net method, experiments were conducted 
      with three publicly available datasets for vessel segmentation: digital retinal 
      images for vessel extraction (DRIVE), the Child Heart Health Study in England 
      (CHASE-DB1), and structured analysis of retina (STARE). Experimental results show 
      that Vess-Net achieved superior performance for all datasets with sensitivity 
      (Se), specificity (Sp), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (Acc) of 80.22%, 
      98.1%, 98.2%, and 96.55% for DRVIE; 82.06%, 98.41%, 98.0%, and 97.26% for 
      CHASE-DB1; and 85.26%, 97.91%, 98.83%, and 96.97% for STARE dataset.

AB  - Prolonged diabetes retinopathy leads to diabetes maculopathy, which causes 
      gradual and irreversible loss of vision. It is important for physicians to have a 
      decision system that detects the early symptoms of the disease. This can be 
      achieved by building a classification model using machine learning algorithms. 
      Fuzzy logic classifiers group data elements with a degree of membership in 
      multiple classes by defining membership functions for each attribute. Various 
      methods have been proposed to determine the partitioning of membership functions 
      in a fuzzy logic inference system. A clustering method partitions the membership 
      functions by grouping data that have high similarity into clusters, while an 
      equalized universe method partitions data into predefined equal clusters. The 
      distribution of each attribute determines its partitioning as fine or coarse. A 
      simple grid partitioning partitions each attribute equally and is therefore not 
      effective in handling varying distribution amongst the attributes. A 
      data-adaptive method uses a data frequency-driven approach to partition each 
      attribute based on the distribution of data in that attribute. A data-adaptive 
      neuro-fuzzy inference system creates corresponding rules for both finely 
      distributed and coarsely distributed attributes. This method produced more useful 
      rules and a more effective classification system. We obtained an overall accuracy 
      of 98.55%.

AB  - The objective of this retrospective study was to predict short-term efficacy of 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in diabetic macular 
      edema (DME) using machine learning regression models. Real-world data from 279 
      DME patients who received anti-VEGF treatment at Ineye Hospital of Chengdu 
      University of TCM between April 2017 and November 2022 were analyzed. Eight 
      machine learning regression models were established to predict four clinical 
      efficacy indicators. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using mean absolute 
      error (MAE), mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination score 
      (R(2)). Multilayer perceptron had the highest R(2) and lowest MAE among all 
      models. Regression tree and lasso regression had similar R(2), with lasso having 
      lower MAE and MSE. Ridge regression, linear regression, support vector machines 
      and polynomial regression had lower R(2) and higher MAE. Support vector machine 
      had the lowest MSE, while polynomial regression had the highest MSE. Stochastic 
      gradient descent had the lowest R(2) and high MAE and MSE. The results indicate 
      that machine learning regression algorithms are valuable and effective in 
      predicting short-term efficacy in DME patients through anti-VEGF treatment, and 
      the lasso regression is the most effective ML algorithm for developing predictive 
      regression models.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric 
      analysis to identify and evaluate global trends in diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      research and visualize the focus and frontiers of this field. METHODS: Diabetic 
      retinopathy-related publications from the establishment of the Web of Science 
      (WOS) through 1 November 2022 were retrieved for qualitative and quantitative 
      analyses. This study analyzed annual publication counts, prolific countries, 
      institutions, journals, and the top 10 most cited literature. The findings were 
      presented through descriptive statistics. VOSviewer 1.6.17 was used to exhibit 
      keywords with high frequency and national cooperation networks, while CiteSpace 
      5.5.R2 displayed the timeline and burst keywords for each term. RESULTS: A total 
      of 10,709 references were analyzed, and the number of publications continuously 
      increased over the investigated period. America had the highest h-index and 
      citation frequency, contributing to the most influence. China was the most 
      prolific country, producing 3,168 articles. The University of London had the 
      highest productivity. The top three productive journals were from America, and 
      Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science had the highest number of 
      publications. The article from Gulshan et al. (2016; co-citation counts, 2,897) 
      served as the representative and symbolic reference. The main research topics in 
      this area were incidence, pathogenesis, treatment, and artificial intelligence 
      (AI). Deep learning, models, biomarkers, and optical coherence tomography 
      angiography (OCTA) of DR were frontier hotspots. CONCLUSION: Bibliometric 
      analysis in this study provided valuable insights into global trends in DR 
      research frontiers. Four key study directions and three research frontiers were 
      extracted from the extensive DR-related literature. As the incidence of DR 
      continues to increase, DR prevention and treatment have become a pressing public 
      health concern and a significant area of research interest. In addition, the 
      development of AI technologies and telemedicine has emerged as promising research 
      frontiers for balancing the number of doctors and patients.

TI  - Deep feed forward neural network-based screening system for diabetic retinopathy 
      severity classification using the lion optimization algorithm.
PG  - 1245-1263

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) has become a major cause of blindness in recent years. 
      Diabetic patients should be screened on a regular basis for early detection, 
      which can help them avoid blindness. Furthermore, the number of diabetic patients 
      undergoing these screening procedures is rapidly increasing, resulting in 
      increased workload for ophthalmologists. An efficient screening system that 
      assists ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis saves ophthalmologists a lot of time and 
      effort. To address this issue, an automatic DR detection screening system is 
      required to improve diagnosis speed and detection accuracy. Appropriate treatment 
      can be provided to patients to prevent vision loss if the severity levels of DR 
      are accurately diagnosed in the early stages. A growing number of screening 
      systems for DR diagnosis have been developed in recent years using various deep 
      learning models, and the majority of the published work did not include any 
      optimization algorithm in the neural network for severity classification. The use 
      of an optimization algorithm with the necessary hyper parameter tuning will 
      improve the model's performance. Considering this as motivation, we proposed a 
      five-phase DFNN-LOA model. The DFNN-LOA algorithm presented here has five phases: 
      (i) pre-processing, (ii) optic disc detection, (iii) segmentation, (iv) feature 
      extraction, and (v) severity classification. The proposed model's experimental 
      analysis is carried out on the MESSIDOR dataset. The experimental results show 
      that the proposed DFNN-LOA model has superior characteristics, with maximum 
      accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, PPV, and NPV of 97.6%, 98.4%, 
      90.7%, 96.5%, 94.6%, and 97.1%, respectively.

AB  - Purpose: To develop an algorithm to detect and quantify hyperreflective dots 
      (HRDs) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with diabetic macular 
      edema (DME). Materials and Methods: Twenty OCTs (each OCT contains 128 b scans) 
      from 20 patients diagnosed with DME were included in this study. Two types of 
      HRDs, hard exudates and small HRDs (hypothesized to be activated microglia), were 
      identified and labeled independently by two raters. An algorithm using deep 
      learning technology was developed based on input (in total 2,560 OCT b scans) of 
      manual labeling and differentiation of HRDs from rater 1. 4-fold cross-validation 
      was used to train and validate the algorithm. Dice coefficient, intraclass 
      coefficient (ICC), correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plot were used to 
      evaluate agreement of the output parameters between two methods (either between 
      two raters or between one rater and proposed algorithm). Results: The Dice 
      coefficients of total HRDs, hard exudates, and small HRDs area of the algorithm 
      were 0.70 ± 0.10, 0.72 ± 0.11, and 0.46 ± 0.06, respectively. The correlations 
      between rater 1 and proposed algorithm (range: 0.95-0.99, all p < 0.001) were 
      stronger than the correlations between the two raters (range: 0.84-0.96, all p < 
      0.001) for all parameters. The ICCs were higher for all the parameters between 
      rater 1 and proposed algorithm (range: 0.972-0.997) than those between the two 
      raters (range: 0.860-0.953). Conclusions: Our proposed algorithm is a good tool 
      to detect and quantify HRDs and can provide objective and repeatable information 
      of OCT for DME patients in clinical practice and studies.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a non-negligible eye disease among patients with 
      Diabetes Mellitus, and automatic retinal image analysis algorithm for the DR 
      screening is in high demand. Considering the resolution of retinal image is very 
      high, where small pathological tissues can be detected only with large resolution 
      image and large local receptive field are required to identify those late stage 
      disease, but directly training a neural network with very deep architecture and 
      high resolution image is both time computational expensive and difficult because 
      of gradient vanishing/exploding problem, we propose a Multi-Cell architecture 
      which gradually increases the depth of deep neural network and the resolution of 
      input image, which both boosts the training time but also improves the 
      classification accuracy. Further, considering the different stages of DR actually 
      progress gradually, which means the labels of different stages are related. To 
      considering the relationships of images with different stages, we propose a 
      Multi-Task learning strategy which predicts the label with both classification 
      and regression. Experimental results on the Kaggle dataset show that our method 
      achieves a Kappa of 0.841 on test set which is the 4th rank of all 
      state-of-the-arts methods. Further, our Multi-Cell Multi-Task Convolutional 
      Neural Networks (M(2)CNN) solution is a general framework, which can be readily 
      integrated with many other deep neural network architectures.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms are powerful prediction tools with immense 
      potential in the clinical setting. There are a number of existing clinical tools 
      that use ML, and many more are in development. Physicians are important 
      stakeholders in the health care system, but most are not equipped to make 
      informed decisions regarding deployment and application of ML technologies in 
      patient care. It is of paramount importance that ML concepts are integrated into 
      medical curricula to position physicians to become informed consumers of the 
      emerging tools employing ML. This paradigm shift is similar to the evidence-based 
      medicine (EBM) movement of the 1990s. At that time, EBM was a novel concept; now, 
      EBM is considered an essential component of medical curricula and critical to the 
      provision of high-quality patient care. ML has the potential to have a similar, 
      if not greater, impact on the practice of medicine. As this technology continues 
      its inexorable march forward, educators must continue to evaluate medical 
      curricula to ensure that physicians are trained to be informed stakeholders in 
      the health care of tomorrow.

AB  - - Objective: To explore the clinical validity of elastic deformation of optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) images for data augmentation in the development of 
      deep-learning model for detection of diabetic macular edema (DME). METHODS: 
      Prospective evaluation of OCT images of DME (n = 320) subject to elastic 
      transformation, with the deformation intensity represented by ([Formula: see 
      text]). Three sets of images, each comprising 100 pairs of scans (100 original & 
      100 modified), were grouped according to the range of ([Formula: see text]), 
      including low-, medium- and high-degree of augmentation; ([Formula: see text] = 
      1-6), ([Formula: see text] = 7-12), and ([Formula: see text] = 13-18), 
      respectively. Three retina specialists evaluated all datasets in a blinded manner 
      and designated each image as 'original' versus 'modified'. The rate of assignment 
      of 'original' value to modified images (false-negative) was determined for each 
      grader in each dataset. RESULTS: The false-negative rates ranged between 71-77% 
      for the low-, 63-76% for the medium-, and 50-75% for the high-augmentation 
      categories. The corresponding rates of correct identification of original images 
      ranged between 75-85% ([Formula: see text]0.05) in the low-, 73-85% ([Formula: 
      see text]0.05 for graders 1 & 2, p = 0.01 for grader 3) in the medium-, and 
      81-91% ([Formula: see text]) in the high-augmentation categories. In the 
      subcategory ([Formula: see text] = 7-9) the false-negative rates were 93-83%, 
      whereas the rates of correctly identifying original images ranged between 89-99% 
      ([Formula: see text]0.05 for all graders). CONCLUSIONS: Deformation of low-medium 
      intensity ([Formula: see text] = 1-9) may be applied without compromising OCT 
      image representativeness in DME. Clinical and Translational Impact 
      Statement-Elastic deformation may efficiently augment the size, robustness, and 
      diversity of training datasets without altering their clinical value, enhancing 
      the development of high-accuracy algorithms for automated interpretation of OCT 
      images.

TI  - Development and External Validation of Machine Learning Models for Diabetic 
      Microvascular Complications: Cross-Sectional Study With Metabolites.
PG  - e41065
LID - 10.2196/41065 [doi]
LID - e41065
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are major 
      diabetic microvascular complications, contributing significantly to morbidity, 
      disability, and mortality worldwide. The kidney and the eye, having similar 
      microvascular structures and physiological and pathogenic features, may 
      experience similar metabolic changes in diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      use machine learning (ML) methods integrated with metabolic data to identify 
      biomarkers associated with DKD and DR in a multiethnic Asian population with 
      diabetes, as well as to improve the performance of DKD and DR detection models 
      beyond traditional risk factors. METHODS: We used ML algorithms (logistic 
      regression [LR] with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and 
      gradient-boosting decision tree) to analyze 2772 adults with diabetes from the 
      Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study, a population-based cross-sectional 
      study conducted in Singapore (2004-2011). From 220 circulating metabolites and 19 
      risk factors, we selected the most important variables associated with DKD 
      (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and DR 
      (defined as an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity level ≥20). 
      DKD and DR detection models were developed based on the variable selection 
      results and externally validated on a sample of 5843 participants with diabetes 
      from the UK biobank (2007-2010). Machine-learned model performance (area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] with 95% CI, sensitivity, and 
      specificity) was compared to that of traditional LR adjusted for age, sex, 
      diabetes duration, hemoglobin A(1c), systolic blood pressure, and BMI. RESULTS: 
      Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases participants had a median age of 61.7 (IQR 
      53.5-69.4) years, with 49.1% (1361/2772) being women, 20.2% (555/2753) having 
      DKD, and 25.4% (685/2693) having DR. UK biobank participants had a median age of 
      61.0 (IQR 55.0-65.0) years, with 35.8% (2090/5843) being women, 6.7% (374/5570) 
      having DKD, and 6.1% (355/5843) having DR. The ML algorithms identified diabetes 
      duration, insulin usage, age, and tyrosine as the most important factors of both 
      DKD and DR. DKD was additionally associated with cardiovascular disease history, 
      antihypertensive medication use, and 3 metabolites (lactate, citrate, and 
      cholesterol esters to total lipids ratio in intermediate-density lipoprotein), 
      while DR was additionally associated with hemoglobin A(1c), blood glucose, pulse 
      pressure, and alanine. Machine-learned models for DKD and DR detection 
      outperformed traditional LR models in both internal (AUC 0.838 vs 0.743 for DKD 
      and 0.790 vs 0.764 for DR) and external validation (AUC 0.791 vs 0.691 for DKD 
      and 0.778 vs 0.760 for DR). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted diabetes 
      duration, insulin usage, age, and circulating tyrosine as important factors in 
      detecting DKD and DR. The integration of ML with biomedical big data enables 
      biomarker discovery and improves disease detection beyond traditional risk 
      factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in American 
      adults. If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing 
      blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence 
      (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The 
      lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable 
      resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. 
      However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical 
      images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information 
      captured in the free text image reports. METHODS: In this study, we examined two 
      state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, 
      including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network 
      implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts 
      from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related 
      clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, 
      developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and 
      developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and 
      relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings 
      including 'gold-standard' setting-where gold-standard concepts were used-and 
      end-to-end setting. RESULTS: For concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained 
      with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for 
      strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using 
      general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The 
      end-to-end system, BERT_general_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 
      0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa 
      architecture, RoBERTa_general_e2e, also achieved the same performance as 
      BERT_general_e2e in strict scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the 
      efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and 
      relation extraction. Our results show that it's necessary to pretrain transformer 
      models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept 
      extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using 
      general English text perform better.

AB  - Background. It is estimated that 347 million people suffer from diabetes mellitus 
      (DM), and almost 5 million are blind due to diabetic retinopathy (DR). The 
      progression of DR can be slowed down with early diagnosis and treatment. 
      Therefore our aim was to develop a novel automated method for DR screening. 
      Methods. 52 patients with diabetes mellitus were enrolled into the project. Of 
      all patients, 39 had signs of DR. Digital retina images and tear fluid samples 
      were taken from each eye. The results from the tear fluid proteomics analysis and 
      from digital microaneurysm (MA) detection on fundus images were used as the input 
      of a machine learning system. Results. MA detection method alone resulted in 0.84 
      sensitivity and 0.81 specificity. Using the proteomics data for analysis 0.87 
      sensitivity and 0.68 specificity values were achieved. The combined data analysis 
      integrated the features of the proteomics data along with the number of detected 
      MAs in the associated image and achieved sensitivity/specificity values of 
      0.93/0.78. Conclusions. As the two different types of data represent independent 
      and complementary information on the outcome, the combined model resulted in a 
      reliable screening method that is comparable to the requirements of DR screening 
      programs applied in clinical routine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the severe complication of 
      diabetic retinopathy causing severe vision loss and leads to blindness in severe 
      cases if left untreated. OBJECTIVE: To grade the severity of DME in retinal 
      images. METHODS: Firstly, the macular is localized using its anatomical features 
      and the information of the macula location with respect to the optic disc. 
      Secondly, a novel method for the exudates detection is proposed. The possible 
      exudate regions are segmented using vector quantization technique and formulated 
      using a set of feature vectors. A semi-supervised learning with graph based 
      classifier is employed to identify the true exudates. Thirdly, the disease 
      severity is graded into different stages based on the location of exudates and 
      the macula coordinates. RESULTS: The results are obtained with the mean value of 
      0.975 and 0.942 for accuracy and F1-scrore, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present 
      work contributes to macula localization, exudate candidate identification with 
      vector quantization and exudate candidate classification with semi-supervised 
      learning. The proposed method and the state-of-the-art approaches are compared in 
      terms of performance, and experimental results show the proposed system overcomes 
      the challenge of the DME grading and demonstrate a promising effectiveness.

TI  - Localizing Microaneurysms in Fundus Images Through Singular Spectrum Analysis.
PG  - 990-1002
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2016.2585344 [doi]
AB  - GOAL: Reliable recognition of microaneurysms (MAs) is an essential task when 
      developing an automated analysis system for diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection. 
      In this study, we propose an integrated approach for automated MA detection with 
      high accuracy. METHODS: Candidate objects are first located by applying a dark 
      object filtering process. Their cross-section profiles along multiple directions 
      are processed through singular spectrum analysis. The correlation coefficient 
      between each processed profile and a typical MA profile is measured and used as a 
      scale factor to adjust the shape of the candidate profile. This is to increase 
      the difference in their profiles between true MAs and other non-MA candidates. A 
      set of statistical features of those profiles is then extracted for a K-nearest 
      neighbor classifier. RESULTS: Experiments show that by applying this process, MAs 
      can be separated well from the retinal background, the most common interfering 
      objects and artifacts. CONCLUSION: The results have demonstrated the robustness 
      of the approach when testing on large scale datasets with clinically acceptable 
      sensitivity and specificity. SIGNIFICANCE: The approach proposed in the evaluated 
      system has great potential when used in an automated DR screening tool or for 
      large scale eye epidemiology studies.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms have been used to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) with 
      specialist-level accuracy. This study aims to validate one such algorithm on a 
      large-scale clinical population, and compare the algorithm performance with that 
      of human graders. A total of 25,326 gradable retinal images of patients with 
      diabetes from the community-based, nationwide screening program of DR in Thailand 
      were analyzed for DR severity and referable diabetic macular edema (DME). Grades 
      adjudicated by a panel of international retinal specialists served as the 
      reference standard. Relative to human graders, for detecting referable DR 
      (moderate NPDR or worse), the deep learning algorithm had significantly higher 
      sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.74, p < 0.001), and a slightly lower specificity (0.96 
      vs. 0.98, p < 0.001). Higher sensitivity of the algorithm was also observed for 
      each of the categories of severe or worse NPDR, PDR, and DME (p < 0.001 for all 
      comparisons). The quadratic-weighted kappa for determination of DR severity 
      levels by the algorithm and human graders was 0.85 and 0.78 respectively 
      (p < 0.001 for the difference). Across different severity levels of DR for 
      determining referable disease, deep learning significantly reduced the false 
      negative rate (by 23%) at the cost of slightly higher false positive rates (2%). 
      Deep learning algorithms may serve as a valuable tool for DR screening.

AB  - PURPOSE: Development and validation of a fully automated method to detect and 
      quantify macular fluid in conventional OCT images. DESIGN: Development of a 
      diagnostic modality. PARTICIPANTS: The clinical dataset for fluid detection 
      consisted of 1200 OCT volumes of patients with neovascular age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD, n = 400), diabetic macular edema (DME, n = 400), or retinal 
      vein occlusion (RVO, n = 400) acquired with Zeiss Cirrus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, 
      Dublin, CA) (n = 600) or Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, 
      Heidelberg, Germany) (n = 600) OCT devices. METHODS: A method based on deep 
      learning to automatically detect and quantify intraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) 
      and subretinal fluid (SRF) was developed. The performance of the algorithm in 
      accurately identifying fluid localization and extent was evaluated against a 
      manual consensus reading of 2 masked reading center graders. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Performance of a fully automated method to accurately detect, 
      differentiate, and quantify intraretinal and SRF using area under the receiver 
      operating characteristics curves, precision, and recall. RESULTS: The newly 
      designed, fully automated diagnostic method based on deep learning achieved 
      optimal accuracy for the detection and quantification of IRC for all 3 macular 
      pathologies with a mean accuracy (AUC) of 0.94 (range, 0.91-0.97), a mean 
      precision of 0.91, and a mean recall of 0.84. The detection and measurement of 
      SRF were also highly accurate with an AUC of 0.92 (range, 0.86-0.98), a mean 
      precision of 0.61, and a mean recall of 0.81, with superior performance in 
      neovascular AMD and RVO compared with DME, which was represented rarely in the 
      population studied. High linear correlation was confirmed between automated and 
      manual fluid localization and quantification, yielding an average Pearson's 
      correlation coefficient of 0.90 for IRC and of 0.96 for SRF. CONCLUSIONS: Deep 
      learning in retinal image analysis achieves excellent accuracy for the 
      differential detection of retinal fluid types across the most prevalent exudative 
      macular diseases and OCT devices. Furthermore, quantification of fluid achieves a 
      high level of concordance with manual expert assessment. Fully automated analysis 
      of retinal OCT images from clinical routine provides a promising horizon in 
      improving accuracy and reliability of retinal diagnosis for research and clinical 
      practice in ophthalmology.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) provides depth-resolved 
      visualization of the retinal microvasculature without intravenous dye injection. 
      It facilitates investigations of various retinal vascular diseases and glaucoma 
      by assessment of qualitative and quantitative microvascular changes in the 
      different retinal layers and radial peripapillary layer non-invasively, 
      individually, and efficiently. Deep learning (DL), a subset of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) based on deep neural networks, has been applied in OCT-A image 
      analysis in recent years and achieved good performance for different tasks, such 
      as image quality control, segmentation, and classification. DL technologies have 
      further facilitated the potential implementation of OCT-A in eye clinics in an 
      automated and efficient manner and enhanced its clinical values for detecting and 
      evaluating various vascular retinopathies. Nevertheless, the deployment of this 
      combination in real-world clinics is still in the "proof-of-concept" stage due to 
      several limitations, such as small training sample size, lack of standardized 
      data preprocessing, insufficient testing in external datasets, and absence of 
      standardized results interpretation. In this review, we introduce the existing 
      applications of DL in OCT-A, summarize the potential challenges of the clinical 
      deployment, and discuss future research directions.

TI  - A graph convolutional network with dynamic weight fusion of multi-scale local 
      features for diabetic retinopathy grading.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious ocular complication that can pose a 
      serious risk to a patient's vision and overall health. Currently, the automatic 
      grading of DR is mainly using deep learning techniques. However, the lesion 
      information in DR images is complex, variable in shape and size, and randomly 
      distributed in the images, which leads to some shortcomings of the current 
      research methods, i.e., it is difficult to effectively extract the information of 
      these various features, and it is difficult to establish the connection between 
      the lesion information in different regions. To address these shortcomings, we 
      design a multi-scale dynamic fusion (MSDF) module and combine it with graph 
      convolution operations to propose a multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional 
      network (MDGNet) in this paper. MDGNet firstly uses convolution kernels with 
      different sizes to extract features with different shapes and sizes in the lesion 
      regions, and then automatically learns the corresponding weights for feature 
      fusion according to the contribution of different features to model grading. 
      Finally, the graph convolution operation is used to link the lesion features in 
      different regions. As a result, our proposed method can effectively combine local 
      and global features, which is beneficial for the correct DR grading. We evaluate 
      the effectiveness of method on two publicly available datasets, namely APTOS and 
      DDR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MDGNet achieves the best 
      grading results on APTOS and DDR, and is more accurate and diverse for the 
      extraction of lesion information.

AB  - PURPOSE: Classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is traditionally based on 
      severity grading, given by the most advanced lesion, but potentially leaving out 
      relevant information for risk stratification. In this study, we aimed to develop 
      a deep learning model able to individually segment seven different DR-lesions, in 
      order to test if this would improve a subsequently developed classification 
      model. METHODS: First, manual segmentation of 34,075 different DR-lesions was 
      used to construct a segmentation model, with performance subsequently compared to 
      another retinal specialist. Second, we constructed a 5-step classification model 
      using a data set of 31,325 expert-annotated retinal 6-field images and evaluated 
      if performance was improved with the integration of presegmentation given by the 
      segmentation model. RESULTS: The segmentation model had higher average 
      sensitivity across all abnormalities compared to the retinal expert (0.68 and 
      0.62) at a comparable average F1-score (0.60 and 0.62). Model sensitivity for 
      microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities 
      was higher by 42.5%, 8.8%, and 67.5% and F1-scores by 15.8%, 6.5%, and 12.5%, 
      respectively. When presegmentation was included, grading performance increased by 
      29.7%, 6.0%, and 4.5% for average per class accuracy, quadratic weighted kappa, 
      and multiclass macro area under the curve, with values of 70.4%, 0.90, and 0.92, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The segmentation model matched an expert in detecting 
      retinal abnormalities, and presegmentation substantially improved accuracy of the 
      automated classification model. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Presegmentation may 
      yield more accurate automated DR grading models and increase interpretability and 
      trust in model decisions.

TI  - Deep-VEGF: deep stacked ensemble model for prediction of vascular endothelial 
      growth factor by concatenating gated recurrent unit with two-dimensional 
      convolutional neural network.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in the development and 
      progression of various diseases, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, macular 
      degeneration and arthritis. Understanding the role of VEGF in various disorders 
      has led to the development of effective treatments, including anti-VEGF drugs, 
      which have significantly improved therapeutic methods. Accurate VEGF 
      identification is critical, yet experimental identification is expensive and 
      time-consuming. This study presents Deep-VEGF, a novel computational model for 
      VEGF prediction based on deep-stacked ensemble learning. We formulated two 
      datasets using primary sequences. A novel feature descriptor named K-Space Tri 
      Slicing-Bigram position-specific scoring metrix (KSTS-BPSSM) is constructed to 
      extract numerical features from primary sequences. The model training is 
      performed by deep learning techniques, including gated recurrent unit (GRU), 
      generative adversarial network (GAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The 
      GRU and CNN are ensembled using stacking learning approach. KSTS-BPSSM-based 
      ensemble model secured the most accurate predictive outcomes, surpassing other 
      competitive predictors across both training and testing datasets. This 
      demonstrates the potential of leveraging deep learning for accurate VEGF 
      prediction as a powerful tool to accelerate research, streamline drug discovery 
      and uncover novel therapeutic targets. This insightful approach holds promise for 
      expanding our knowledge of VEGF's role in health and disease.Communicated by

TI  - AI-Human Hybrid Workflow Enhances Teleophthalmology for the Detection of Diabetic 
      Retinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) outside of specialized eye care 
      settings is an important means of access to vision-preserving health maintenance. 
      Remote interpretation of fundus photographs acquired in a primary care or other 
      nonophthalmic setting in a store-and-forward manner is a predominant paradigm of 
      teleophthalmology screening programs. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image 
      interpretation offers an alternative means of DR detection. IDx-DR (Digital 
      Diagnostics Inc) is a Food and Drug Administration-authorized autonomous testing 
      device for DR. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of IDx-DR compared with 
      human-based teleophthalmology over 2 and a half years. Additionally, we evaluated 
      an AI-human hybrid workflow that combines AI-system evaluation with human 
      expert-based assessment for referable cases. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study and 
      retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Diabetic patients ≥ 18 years old without a 
      prior DR diagnosis or DR examination in the past year presenting for routine DR 
      screening in a primary care clinic. METHODS: Macula-centered and optic 
      nerve-centered fundus photographs were evaluated by an AI algorithm followed by 
      consensus-based overreading by retina specialists at the Stanford Ophthalmic 
      Reading Center. Detection of more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy (MTMDR) was 
      compared with in-person examination by a retina specialist. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and 
      gradability achieved by the AI algorithm and retina specialists. RESULTS: The AI 
      algorithm had higher sensitivity (95.5% sensitivity; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 86.7%-100%) but lower specificity (60.3% specificity; 95% CI, 47.7%-72.9%) 
      for detection of MTMDR compared with remote image interpretation by retina 
      specialists (69.5% sensitivity; 95% CI, 50.7%-88.3%; 96.9% specificity; 95% CI, 
      93.5%-100%). Gradability of encounters was also lower for the AI algorithm 
      (62.5%) compared with retina specialists (93.1%). A 2-step AI-human hybrid 
      workflow in which the AI algorithm initially rendered an assessment followed by 
      overread by a retina specialist of MTMDR-positive encounters resulted in a 
      sensitivity of 95.5% (95% CI, 86.7%-100%) and a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI, 
      94.6%-100%). Similarly, a 2-step overread by retina specialists of AI-ungradable 
      encounters improved gradability from 63.5% to 95.6% of encounters. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Implementation of an AI-human hybrid teleophthalmology workflow may both decrease 
      reliance on human specialist effort and improve diagnostic accuracy. FINANCIAL

PG  - 189-203
LID - 10.1007/s11517-021-02469-w [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays an important role in 
      ophthalmology and automatic analysis of the OCT is of real importance: image 
      denoising facilitates a better diagnosis and image segmentation and 
      classification are undeniably critical in treatment evaluation. Synthetic OCT was 
      recently considered to provide a benchmark for quantitative comparison of 
      automatic algorithms and to be utilized in the training stage of novel solutions 
      based on deep learning. Due to complicated data structure in retinal OCTs, a 
      limited number of delineated OCT datasets are already available in presence of 
      abnormalities; furthermore, the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) structure of OCT 
      is ignored in many public 2D datasets. We propose a new synthetic method, 
      applicable to 3D data and feasible in presence of abnormalities like diabetic 
      macular edema (DME). In this method, a limited number of OCT data is used during 
      the training step and the Active Shape Model is used to produce synthetic OCTs 
      plus delineation of retinal boundaries and location of abnormalities. Statistical 
      comparison of thickness maps showed that synthetic dataset can be used as a 
      statistically acceptable representative of the original dataset (p > 0.05). 
      Visual inspection of the synthesized vessels was also promising. Regarding the 
      texture features of the synthesized datasets, Q-Q plots were used, and even in 
      cases that the points have slightly digressed from the straight line, the 
      p-values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejected the null hypothesis and showed 
      the same distribution in texture features of the real and the synthetic data. The 
      proposed algorithm provides a unique benchmark for comparison of OCT enhancement 
      methods and a tailored augmentation method to overcome the limited number of OCTs 
      in deep learning algorithms.

AB  - The eye is one of the most important organs of the human body. Eye diseases are 
      closely related to other systemic diseases, both of which influence each other. 
      Numerous systemic diseases lead to special clinical manifestations and 
      complications in the eyes. Typical diseases include diabetic retinopathy, 
      hypertensive retinopathy, thyroid associated ophthalmopathy, optic neuromyelitis, 
      and Behcet's disease. Systemic disease-related ophthalmopathy is usually a 
      chronic disease, and the analysis of imaging markers is helpful for a 
      comprehensive diagnosis of these diseases. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) 
      technology based on deep learning has rapidly developed, leading to numerous 
      achievements and arousing widespread concern. Presently, AI technology has made 
      significant progress in research on imaging markers of systemic disease-related 
      ophthalmopathy; however, there are also many limitations and challenges. This 
      article reviews the research achievements, limitations, and future prospects of 
      AI image analysis technology in systemic disease-related ophthalmopathy.

AB  - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of blindness in 
      diabetic individuals. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography 
      (OCTA) are noninvasive imaging techniques useful for the diagnosis and assessment 
      of PDR. We aim to review several recent developments using OCT and discuss their 
      present and potential future applications in the clinical setting. An electronic 
      database search was performed so as to include all studies assessing OCT and/or 
      OCTA findings in PDR patients published from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2021. 
      Thirty studies were included, and the most recently published data essentially 
      focused on the higher detection rate of neovascularization obtained with 
      widefield-OCT and/or OCTA (WF-OCT/OCTA) and on the increasing quality of retinal 
      imaging with quality levels non-inferior to widefield-fluorescein angiography 
      (WF-FA). There were also significant developments in the study of retinal 
      nonperfusion areas (NPAs) using these techniques and research on the impact of 
      PDR treatment on NPAs and on vascular density. It is becoming increasingly clear 
      that it is critical to use adequate imaging protocols focused on optimized 
      segmentation and maximized imaged retinal area, with ongoing technological 
      development through artificial intelligence and deep learning. These latest 
      findings emphasize the growing applicability and role of noninvasive imaging in 
      managing PDR with the added benefit of avoiding the repetition of invasive 
      conventional FA.

AB  - Proliferative retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of 
      prematurity, are leading causes of vision impairment. A common feature is a loss 
      of retinal capillary vessels resulting in hypoxia and neuronal damage. The 
      oxygen-induced retinopathy model is widely used to study revascularization of an 
      ischemic area in the mouse retina. The presence of endothelial tip cells 
      indicates vascular recovery; however, their quantification relies on manual 
      counting in microscopy images of retinal flat mount preparations. Recent advances 
      in deep neural networks (DNNs) allow the automation of such tasks. We demonstrate 
      a workflow for detection of tip cells in retinal images using the DNN-based 
      Single Shot Detector (SSD). The SSD was designed for detection of objects in 
      natural images. We adapt the SSD architecture and training procedure to the tip 
      cell detection task and retrain the DNN using labeled tip cells in images of 
      fluorescently stained retina flat mounts. Transferring knowledge from the 
      pretrained DNN and extensive data augmentation reduced the amount of required 
      labeled data. Our system shows a performance comparable to the human level, while 
      providing highly consistent results. Therefore, such a system can automate 
      counting of tip cells, a readout frequently used in retinopathy research, thereby 
      reducing routine work for biomedical experts.

TI  - TMM-Nets: Transferred Multi- to Mono-Modal Generation for Lupus Retinopathy 
      Diagnosis.
PG  - 1083-1094
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3223683 [doi]
AB  - Rare diseases, which are severely underrepresented in basic and clinical 
      research, can particularly benefit from machine learning techniques. However, 
      current learning-based approaches usually focus on either mono-modal image data 
      or matched multi-modal data, whereas the diagnosis of rare diseases necessitates 
      the aggregation of unstructured and unmatched multi-modal image data due to their 
      rare and diverse nature. In this study, we therefore propose diagnosis-guided 
      multi-to-mono modal generation networks (TMM-Nets) along with training and 
      testing procedures. TMM-Nets can transfer data from multiple sources to a single 
      modality for diagnostic data structurization. To demonstrate their potential in 
      the context of rare diseases, TMM-Nets were deployed to diagnose the lupus 
      retinopathy (LR-SLE), leveraging unmatched regular and ultra-wide-field fundus 
      images for transfer learning. The TMM-Nets encoded the transfer learning from 
      diabetic retinopathy to LR-SLE based on the similarity of the fundus lesions. In 
      addition, a lesion-aware multi-scale attention mechanism was developed for 
      clinical alerts, enabling TMM-Nets not only to inform patient care, but also to 
      provide insights consistent with those of clinicians. An adversarial strategy was 
      also developed to refine multi- to mono-modal image generation based on 
      diagnostic results and the data distribution to enhance the data augmentation 
      performance. Compared to the baseline model, the TMM-Nets showed 35.19% and 
      33.56% F1 score improvements on the test and external validation sets, 
      respectively. In addition, the TMM-Nets can be used to develop diagnostic models 
      for other rare diseases.

AB  - Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in countless deaths and 
      has harmed all facets of human existence. COVID-19 has been designated an 
      epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has placed a tremendous 
      burden on nearly all countries, especially those with weak health systems. 
      However, Deep Learning (DL) has been applied in several applications and many 
      types of detection applications in the medical field, including thyroid 
      diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, fetal localization, and detection of diabetic 
      retinopathy. Furthermore, various clinical imaging sources, like Magnetic 
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT), make DL a perfect 
      technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19. Inspired by this fact, a 
      considerable amount of research has been done. A Systematic Literature Review 
      (SLR) has been used in this study to discover, assess, and integrate findings 
      from relevant studies. DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized 
      into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), 
      Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative 
      Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and 
      hybrid approaches. Then, the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques 
      and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted. 
      Moreover, many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for COVID-19 
      have been addressed, which are anticipated to stimulate more investigations to 
      control the prevalence and disaster control in the future. According to the 
      findings, most papers are assessed using characteristics such as accuracy, delay, 
      robustness, and scalability. Meanwhile, other features are underutilized, such as 
      security and convergence time. Python is also the most commonly used language in 
      papers, accounting for 75% of the time. According to the investigation, 37.83% of 
      applications have identified chest CT/chest X-ray images for patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the general rules and future trajectories of deep learning 
      (DL) networks in medical image analysis through bibliometric and hot spot 
      analysis of original articles published between 2012 and 2020. METHODS: Original 
      articles related to DL and medical imaging were retrieved from the PubMed 
      database. For the analysis, data regarding radiological subspecialties; imaging 
      techniques; DL networks; sample size; study purposes, setting, origins and 
      design; statistical analysis; funding sources; authors; and first authors' 
      affiliation was manually extracted from each article. The Bibliographic Item 
      Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder and VOSviewer were used to identify the research 
      topics of the included articles and illustrate the future trajectories of 
      studies. RESULTS: The study included 2685 original articles. The number of 
      publications on DL and medical imaging has increased substantially since 2017, 
      accounting for 97.2% of all included articles. We evaluated the rules of the 
      application of 47 DL networks to eight radiological tasks on 11 human organ 
      sites. Neuroradiology, thorax, and abdomen were frequent research subjects, while 
      thyroid was under-represented. Segmentation and classification tasks were the 
      primary purposes. U-Net, ResNet, and VGG were the most frequently used 
      Convolutional neural network-derived networks. GAN-derived networks were widely 
      developed and applied in 2020, and transfer learning was highlighted in the 
      COVID-19 studies. Brain, prostate, and diabetic retinopathy-related studies were 
      mature research topics in the field. Breast- and lung-related studies were in a 
      stage of rapid development. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the general rules 
      and future trajectories of DL network application in medical image analyses and 
      provides guidance for future studies.

TI  - Cross-domain retinopathy classification with optical coherence tomography images 
      via a novel deep domain adaptation method.
PG  - e202100096
LID - 10.1002/jbio.202100096 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning based retinopathy classification with optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) images has recently attracted great attention. However, existing deep 
      learning methods fail to work well when training and testing datasets are 
      different due to the general issue of domain shift between datasets caused by 
      different collection devices, subjects, imaging parameters, etc. To address this 
      practical and challenging issue, we propose a novel deep domain adaptation (DDA) 
      method to train a model on a labeled dataset and adapt it to an unlabelled 
      dataset (collected under different conditions). It consists of two modules for 
      domain alignment, that is, adversarial learning and entropy minimization. We 
      conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to evaluate the 
      performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that there are large 
      domain shifts between datasets, resulting a poor performance for conventional 
      deep learning methods. The proposed DDA method can significantly outperform 
      existing methods for retinopathy classification with OCT images. It achieves 
      retinopathy classification accuracies of 0.915, 0.959 and 0.990 under three 
      cross-domain (cross-dataset) scenarios. Moreover, it obtains a comparable 
      performance with human experts on a dataset where no labeled data in this dataset 
      have been used to train the proposed DDA method. We have also visualized the 
      learnt features by using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) 
      technique. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn 
      discriminative features for retinopathy classification.

TI  - Updates in deep learning research in ophthalmology.
PG  - 2357-2376
LID - 10.1042/CS20210207 [doi]
AB  - Ophthalmology has been one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI) 
      within the medical field. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has garnered 
      significant attention due to the availability of large amounts of data and 
      digitized ocular images. Currently, AI in Ophthalmology is mainly focused on 
      improving disease classification and supporting decision-making when treating 
      ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, most 
      of the DL systems (DLSs) developed thus far remain in the research stage and only 
      a handful are able to achieve clinical translation. This phenomenon is due to a 
      combination of factors including concerns over security and privacy, poor 
      generalizability, trust and explainability issues, unfavorable end-user 
      perceptions and uncertain economic value. Overcoming this challenge would require 
      a combination approach. Firstly, emerging techniques such as federated learning 
      (FL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autonomous AI and blockchain will 
      be playing an increasingly critical role to enhance privacy, collaboration and 
      DLS performance. Next, compliance to reporting and regulatory guidelines, such as 
      CONSORT-AI and STARD-AI, will be required to in order to improve transparency, 
      minimize abuse and ensure reproducibility. Thirdly, frameworks will be required 
      to obtain patient consent, perform ethical assessment and evaluate end-user 
      perception. Lastly, proper health economic assessment (HEA) must be performed to 
      provide financial visibility during the early phases of DLS development. This is 
      necessary to manage resources prudently and guide the development of DLS.

AB  - Neurology practice has faced many challenges since Jean-Martin Charcot 
      established its sacred tenets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to 
      revolutionize the time-tested neurology practice in unimaginable ways. AI can now 
      diagnose stroke from CT/MRI scans, detect papilledema and diabetic retinopathy 
      from retinal scans, interpret electroencephalogram (EEG) to prognosticate coma, 
      detect seizure well before ictus, predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment 
      to Alzheimer's dementia, classify neurodegenerative diseases based on gait and 
      handwriting. Clinical practice would likely change in near future to accommodate 
      AI as a complementary tool. The clinician should be prepared to change the 
      perception of AI from nemesis to opportunity.

TI  - Evaluating the accuracy of the Ophthalmologist Robot for multiple 
      blindness-causing eye diseases: a multicentre, prospective study protocol.
PG  - e077859

LID - e077859
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early eye screening and treatment can reduce the incidence of 
      blindness by detecting and addressing eye diseases at an early stage. The 
      Ophthalmologist Robot is an automated device that can simultaneously capture 
      ocular surface and fundus images without the need for ophthalmologists, making it 
      highly suitable for primary application. However, the accuracy of the device's 
      screening capabilities requires further validation. This study aims to evaluate 
      and compare the screening accuracies of ophthalmologists and deep learning models 
      using images captured by the Ophthalmologist Robot, in order to identify a 
      screening method that is both highly accurate and cost-effective. Our findings 
      may provide valuable insights into the potential applications of remote eye 
      screening. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective study that 
      will recruit approximately 1578 participants from 3 hospitals. All participants 
      will undergo ocular surface and fundus images taken by the Ophthalmologist Robot. 
      Additionally, 695 participants will have their ocular surface imaged with a slit 
      lamp. Relevant information from outpatient medical records will be collected. The 
      primary objective is to evaluate the accuracy of ophthalmologists' screening for 
      multiple blindness-causing eye diseases using device images through receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analysis. The targeted diseases include keratitis, 
      corneal scar, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy and pathological myopia. The secondary objective is 
      to assess the accuracy of deep learning models in disease screening. Furthermore, 
      the study aims to compare the consistency between the Ophthalmologist Robot and 
      the slit lamp in screening for keratitis and corneal scar using the Kappa test. 
      Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of three eye screening methods, based on 
      non-telemedicine screening, ophthalmologist-telemedicine screening and artificial 
      intelligence-telemedicine screening, will be assessed by constructing Markov 
      models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has obtained approval from the ethics 
      committee of the Ophthalmology and Optometry Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
      University (reference: 2023-026 K-21-01). This work will be disseminated by 
      peer-review publications, abstract presentations at national and international 
      conferences and data sharing with other researchers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks is more accurate and reliable than 
      board-certified ophthalmologists at detecting multiple diseases in retinal fundus 
      photographs.
PG  - 417-423

AB  - AIMS: To develop an algorithm to classify multiple retinal pathologies accurately 
      and reliably from fundus photographs and to validate its performance against 
      human experts. METHODS: We trained a deep convolutional ensemble (DCE), an 
      ensemble of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify retinal fundus 
      photographs into diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) and normal eyes. The CNN architecture was based on the 
      InceptionV3 model, and initial weights were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. 
      We used 43 055 fundus images from 12 public datasets. Five trained ensembles were 
      then tested on an 'unseen' set of 100 images. Seven board-certified 
      ophthalmologists were asked to classify these test images. RESULTS: 
      Board-certified ophthalmologists achieved a mean accuracy of 72.7% over all 
      classes, while the DCE achieved a mean accuracy of 79.2% (p=0.03). The DCE had a 
      statistically significant higher mean F1-score for DR classification compared 
      with the ophthalmologists (76.8% vs 57.5%; p=0.01) and greater but statistically 
      non-significant mean F1-scores for glaucoma (83.9% vs 75.7%; p=0.10), AMD (85.9% 
      vs 85.2%; p=0.69) and normal eyes (73.0% vs 70.5%; p=0.39). The DCE had a greater 
      mean agreement between accuracy and confident of 81.6% vs 70.3% (p<0.001). 
      DISCUSSION: We developed a deep learning model and found that it could more 
      accurately and reliably classify four categories of fundus images compared with 
      board-certified ophthalmologists. This work provides proof-of-principle that an 
      algorithm is capable of accurate and reliable recognition of multiple retinal 
      diseases using only fundus photographs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Numerous angiographic images with high variability in quality are 
      obtained during each ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) acquisition 
      session. This study evaluated the feasibility of an automated system for image 
      quality classification and selection using deep learning. METHODS: The training 
      set was comprised of 3543 UWFA images. Ground-truth image quality was assessed by 
      expert image review and classified into one of four categories (ungradable, poor, 
      good, or best) based on contrast, field of view, media opacity, and obscuration 
      from external features. Two test sets, including randomly selected 392 images 
      separated from the training set and an independent balanced image set composed of 
      50 ungradable/poor and 50 good/best images, assessed the model performance and 
      bias. RESULTS: In the randomly selected and balanced test sets, the automated 
      quality assessment system showed overall accuracy of 89.0% and 94.0% for 
      distinguishing between gradable and ungradable images, with sensitivity of 90.5% 
      and 98.6% and specificity of 87.0% and 81.5%, respectively. The receiver 
      operating characteristic curve measuring performance of two-class classification 
      (ungradable and gradable) had an area under the curve of 0.920 in the randomly 
      selected set and 0.980 in the balanced set. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning 
      classification model demonstrates the feasibility of automatic classification of 
      UWFA image quality. Clinical application of this system might greatly reduce 
      manual image grading workload, allow quality-based image presentation to 
      clinicians, and provide near-instantaneous feedback on image quality during image 
      acquisition for photographers. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The UWFA image quality 
      classification tool may significantly reduce manual grading for clinical- and 
      research-related work, providing instantaneous and reliable feedback on image 
      quality.

LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3222638 [doi]
AB  - Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), a functional extension of OCT, 
      has the potential to replace most invasive fluorescein angiography (FA) exams in 
      ophthalmology. So far, OCTA's field of view is however still lacking behind 
      fluorescence fundus photography techniques. This is problematic, because many 
      retinal diseases manifest at an early stage by changes of the peripheral retinal 
      capillary network. It is therefore desirable to expand OCTA's field of view to 
      match that of ultra-widefield fundus cameras. We present a custom developed 
      clinical high-speed swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) system operating at an acquisition 
      rate 8-16 times faster than today's state-of-the-art commercially available OCTA 
      devices. Its speed allows us to capture ultra-wide fields of view of up to 90 
      degrees with an unprecedented sampling density and hence extraordinary resolution 
      by merging two single shot scans with 60 degrees in diameter. To further enhance 
      the visual appearance of the angiograms, we developed for the first time a 
      three-dimensional deep learning based algorithm for denoising volumetric OCTA 
      data sets. We showcase its imaging performance and clinical usability by 
      presenting images of patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Iterative Augmentation of Visual Evidence for Weakly-Supervised Lesion 
      Localization in Deep Interpretability Frameworks: Application to Color Fundus 
      Images.
PG  - 3499-3511
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2020.2994463 [doi]
AB  - Interpretability of deep learning (DL) systems is gaining attention in medical 
      imaging to increase experts' trust in the obtained predictions and facilitate 
      their integration in clinical settings. We propose a deep visualization method to 
      generate interpretability of DL classification tasks in medical imaging by means 
      of visual evidence augmentation. The proposed method iteratively unveils 
      abnormalities based on the prediction of a classifier trained only with 
      image-level labels. For each image, initial visual evidence of the prediction is 
      extracted with a given visual attribution technique. This provides localization 
      of abnormalities that are then removed through selective inpainting. We 
      iteratively apply this procedure until the system considers the image as normal. 
      This yields augmented visual evidence, including less discriminative lesions 
      which were not detected at first but should be considered for final diagnosis. We 
      apply the method to grading of two retinal diseases in color fundus images: 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We evaluate 
      the generated visual evidence and the performance of weakly-supervised 
      localization of different types of DR and AMD abnormalities, both qualitatively 
      and quantitatively. We show that the augmented visual evidence of the predictions 
      highlights the biomarkers considered by experts for diagnosis and improves the 
      final localization performance. It results in a relative increase of 11.2± 2.0% 
      per image regarding sensitivity averaged at 10 false positives/image on average, 
      when applied to different classification tasks, visual attribution techniques and 
      network architectures. This makes the proposed method a useful tool for 
      exhaustive visual support of DL classifiers in medical imaging.

TI  - Deepfakes in Ophthalmology: Applications and Realism of Synthetic Retinal Images 
      from Generative Adversarial Networks.
PG  - 100079
LID - 10.1016/j.xops.2021.100079 [doi]
LID - 100079
AB  - PURPOSE: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are deep learning (DL) models 
      that can create and modify realistic-appearing synthetic images, or deepfakes, 
      from real images. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the ability of experts 
      to discern synthesized retinal fundus images from real fundus images and to 
      review the current uses and limitations of GANs in ophthalmology. DESIGN: 
      Development and expert evaluation of a GAN and an informal review of the 
      literature. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4282 image pairs of fundus images and 
      retinal vessel maps acquired from a multicenter ROP screening program. METHODS: 
      Pix2Pix HD, a high-resolution GAN, was first trained and validated on fundus and 
      vessel map image pairs and subsequently used to generate 880 images from a 
      held-out test set. Fifty synthetic images from this test set and 50 different 
      real images were presented to 4 expert ROP ophthalmologists using a custom online 
      system for evaluation of whether the images were real or synthetic. Literature 
      was reviewed on PubMed and Google Scholars using combinations of the terms 
      ophthalmology, GANs, generative adversarial networks, ophthalmology, images, 
      deepfakes, and synthetic. Ancestor search was performed to broaden results. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Expert ability to discern real versus synthetic images was 
      evaluated using percent accuracy. Statistical significance was evaluated using a 
      Fisher exact test, with P values ≤ 0.05 thresholded for significance. RESULTS: 
      The expert majority correctly identified 59% of images as being real or synthetic 
      (P = 0.1). Experts 1 to 4 correctly identified 54%, 58%, 49%, and 61% of images 
      (P = 0.505, 0.158, 1.000, and 0.043, respectively). These results suggest that 
      the majority of experts could not discern between real and synthetic images. 
      Additionally, we identified 20 implementations of GANs in the ophthalmology 
      literature, with applications in a variety of imaging modalities and ophthalmic 
      diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Generative adversarial networks can create synthetic 
      fundus images that are indiscernible from real fundus images by expert ROP 
      ophthalmologists. Synthetic images may improve dataset augmentation for DL, may 
      be used in trainee education, and may have implications for patient privacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early identification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is key to 
      prioritizing therapy and preventing permanent blindness. This study aims to 
      propose a machine learning model for DR early diagnosis using metabolomics and 
      clinical indicators. METHODS: From 2017 to 2018, 950 participants were enrolled 
      from two affiliated hospitals of Wenzhou Medical University and Anhui Medical 
      University. A total of 69 matched blocks including healthy volunteers, type 2 
      diabetes, and DR patients were obtained from a propensity score matching-based 
      metabolomics study. UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system was utilized for serum metabolic 
      fingerprint data. CART decision trees (DT) were used to identify the potential 
      biomarkers. Finally, the nomogram model was developed using the multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression models. The calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow 
      test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were 
      applied to evaluate the performance of this predictive model. RESULTS: The mean 
      age of enrolled subjects was 56.7 years with a standard deviation of 9.2, and 
      61.4% were males. Based on the DT model, 2-pyrrolidone completely separated 
      healthy controls from diabetic patients, and thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) might 
      be a principal metabolite for DR detection. The developed nomogram model 
      (including diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure and ThTP) shows an 
      excellent quality of classification, with AUCs (95% CI) of 0.99 (0.97-1.00) and 
      0.99 (0.95-1.00) in training and testing sets, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      predictive model also has a reasonable degree of calibration. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      nomogram presents an accurate and favorable prediction for DR detection. Further 
      research with larger study populations is needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a pathologic change of the human retinal vasculature, 
      is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults with diabetes mellitus. 
      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a functional extension of 
      optical coherence tomography, has shown potential as a tool for early diagnosis 
      of DR through its ability to visualize the retinal vasculature in all spatial 
      dimensions. Previously introduced deep learning-based classifiers were able to 
      support the detection of DR in OCTA images, but require expert labeling at the 
      pixel level, a labor-intensive and expensive process. We present a multiple 
      instance learning-based network, MIL-ResNet,14 that is capable of detecting 
      biomarkers in an OCTA dataset with high accuracy, without the need for 
      annotations other than the information whether a scan is from a diabetic patient 
      or not. The dataset we used for this study was acquired with a diagnostic 
      ultra-widefield swept-source OCT device with a MHz A-scan rate. We were able to 
      show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art networks for 
      this classification task, ResNet14 and VGG16. In addition, our network pays 
      special attention to clinically relevant biomarkers and is robust against 
      adversarial attacks. Therefore, we believe that it could serve as a powerful 
      diagnostic decision support tool for clinical ophthalmic screening.

TI  - Diabetic retinopathy risk prediction for fundus examination using sparse 
      learning: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-13-106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blindness due to diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major disability in 
      diabetic patients. Although early management has shown to prevent vision loss, 
      diabetic patients have a low rate of routine ophthalmologic examination. Hence, 
      we developed and validated sparse learning models with the aim of identifying the 
      risk of DR in diabetic patients. METHODS: Health records from the Korea National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) V-1 were used. The prediction 
      models for DR were constructed using data from 327 diabetic patients, and were 
      validated internally on 163 patients in the KNHANES V-1. External validation was 
      performed using 562 diabetic patients in the KNHANES V-2. The learning models, 
      including ridge, elastic net, and LASSO, were compared to the traditional 
      indicators of DR. RESULTS: Considering the Bayesian information criterion, LASSO 
      predicted DR most efficiently. In the internal and external validation, LASSO was 
      significantly superior to the traditional indicators by calculating the area 
      under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. LASSO showed an 
      AUC of 0.81 and an accuracy of 73.6% in the internal validation, and an AUC of 
      0.82 and an accuracy of 75.2% in the external validation. CONCLUSION: The sparse 
      learning model using LASSO was effective in analyzing the epidemiological 
      underlying patterns of DR. This is the first study to develop a machine learning 
      model to predict DR risk using health records. LASSO can be an excellent choice 
      when both discriminative power and variable selection are important in the 
      analysis of high-dimensional electronic health records.

TI  - Predictive Models for Diabetic Retinopathy from Non-Image Teleretinal Screening 
      Data.
PG  - 472-477
AB  - Introduction: Timely diabetic retinopathy detection remains a problem in 
      medically underserved settings in the US; diabetic patients in these locales have 
      limited access to eye specialists. Teleretinal screening programs have been 
      introduced to address this problem. Methods: Using data on ethnicity, gender, 
      age, hemoglobin A1C, insulin dependence, time since last eye examination, 
      subjective diabetes control, and years with diabetes from 27,116 diabetic 
      patients participating in a Los Angeles County teleretinal screening program, we 
      compared different machine learning methods for predicting retinopathy. The 
      dataset exhibited a class imbalance. Results: Six classifiers learned on the data 
      were predictive of retinopathy. The best model had an AUC of 0.754, sensitivity 
      of 58% and specificity of 80%. Discussion: Successfully detecting retinopathy 
      from diabetic patients' routinely collected clinical data could help clinicians 
      in medically underserved areas identify unscreened diabetic patients who are at 
      risk of developing retinopathy. This work is a step towards that goal.

TI  - Classification of large-scale fundus image data sets: a cloud-computing 
      framework.
PG  - 3256-3259
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591423 [doi]
AB  - Large medical image data sets with high dimensionality require substantial amount 
      of computation time for data creation and data processing. This paper presents a 
      novel generalized method that finds optimal image-based feature sets that reduce 
      computational time complexity while maximizing overall classification accuracy 
      for detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR). First, region-based and pixel-based 
      features are extracted from fundus images for classification of DR lesions and 
      vessel-like structures. Next, feature ranking strategies are used to distinguish 
      the optimal classification feature sets. DR lesion and vessel classification 
      accuracies are computed using the boosted decision tree and decision forest 
      classifiers in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio platform, 
      respectively. For images from the DIARETDB1 data set, 40 of its highest-ranked 
      features are used to classify four DR lesion types with an average classification 
      accuracy of 90.1% in 792 seconds. Also, for classification of red lesion regions 
      and hemorrhages from microaneurysms, accuracies of 85% and 72% are observed, 
      respectively. For images from STARE data set, 40 high-ranked features can 
      classify minor blood vessels with an accuracy of 83.5% in 326 seconds. Such 
      cloud-based fundus image analysis systems can significantly enhance the 
      borderline classification performances in automated screening systems.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and 
      glaucoma are vision-threatening diseases that are leading causes of vision loss. 
      Many studies have validated deep learning artificial intelligence for image-based 
      diagnosis of vision-threatening diseases. Our study prospectively investigated 
      deep learning artificial intelligence applications in student-run non-mydriatic 
      screenings for an underserved, primarily Hispanic community during COVID-19. 
      METHODS: Five supervised student-run community screenings were held in West New 
      York, New Jersey. Participants underwent non-mydriatic 45-degree retinal imaging 
      by medical students. Images were uploaded to a cloud-based deep learning 
      artificial intelligence for vision-threatening disease referral. An on-site 
      tele-ophthalmology grader and remote clinical ophthalmologist graded images, with 
      adjudication by a senior ophthalmologist to establish the gold standard 
      diagnosis, which was used to assess the performance of deep learning artificial 
      intelligence. RESULTS: A total of 385 eyes from 195 screening participants were 
      included (mean age 52.43  ±  14.5 years, 40.0% female). A total of 48 
      participants were referred for at least one vision-threatening disease. Deep 
      learning artificial intelligence marked 150/385 (38.9%) eyes as ungradable, 
      compared to 10/385 (2.6%) ungradable as per the human gold standard (p < 0.001). 
      Deep learning artificial intelligence had 63.2% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity, 
      32.0% positive predictive value, and 98.4% negative predictive value in 
      vision-threatening disease referrals. Deep learning artificial intelligence 
      successfully referred all 4 eyes with multiple vision-threatening diseases. Deep 
      learning artificial intelligence graded images (35.6  ±  13.3 s) faster than the 
      tele-ophthalmology grader (129  ±  41.0) and clinical ophthalmologist 
      (68  ±  21.9, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Deep learning artificial intelligence can 
      increase the efficiency and accessibility of vision-threatening disease 
      screenings, particularly in underserved communities. Deep learning artificial 
      intelligence should be adaptable to different environments. Consideration should 
      be given to how deep learning artificial intelligence can best be utilized in a 
      real-world application, whether in computer-aided or autonomous diagnosis.

AB  - By incorporating multiple indicators that facilitate clinical decision making and 
      effective management of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a comprehensive understanding 
      of the progression of the disease can be achieved. However, the diversity of DR 
      complications poses challenges to the automatic analysis of various information 
      within images. This study aims to establish a deep learning system designed to 
      examine various metrics linked to DR in ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography 
      (UWFA) images. We have developed a unified model based on image generation that 
      transforms input images into corresponding disease-free versions. By 
      incorporating an image-level supervised training process, the model significantly 
      reduces the need for extensive manual involvement in clinical applications. 
      Furthermore, compared to other comparative methods, the quality of our generated 
      images is significantly superior.

AB  - PURPOSE: To achieve automatic diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection in retinal 
      fundus photographs through the use of a deep transfer learning approach using the 
      Inception-v3 network. METHODS: A total of 19,233 eye fundus color numerical 
      images were retrospectively obtained from 5278 adult patients presenting for DR 
      screening. The 8816 images passed image-quality review and were graded as no 
      apparent DR (1374 images), mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) (2152 images), 
      moderate NPDR (2370 images), severe NPDR (1984 images), and proliferative DR 
      (PDR) (936 images) by eight retinal experts according to the International 
      Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy severity scale. After image preprocessing, 7935 DR 
      images were selected from the above categories as a training dataset, while the 
      rest of the images were used as validation dataset. We introduced a 10-fold 
      cross-validation strategy to assess and optimize our model. We also selected the 
      publicly independent Messidor-2 dataset to test the performance of our model. For 
      discrimination between no referral (no apparent DR and mild NPDR) and referral 
      (moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and PDR), we also computed prediction accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC), and κ value. RESULTS: The proposed approach achieved a high classification 
      accuracy of 93.49% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.13%-93.85%), with a 96.93% 
      sensitivity (95% CI, 96.35%-97.51%) and a 93.45% specificity (95% CI, 
      93.12%-93.79%), while the AUC was up to 0.9905 (95% CI, 0.9887-0.9923) on the 
      independent test dataset. The κ value of our best model was 0.919, while the 
      three experts had κ values of 0.906, 0.931, and 0.914, independently. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This approach could automatically detect DR with excellent 
      sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity and could aid in making a referral 
      recommendation for further evaluation and treatment with high reliability. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This approach has great value in early DR screening 
      using retinal fundus photographs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In April 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) medical device for detecting 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), the IDx-DR. However, there is a lack of evaluation 
      systems for DR intelligent diagnostic technology. METHODS: Five hundred color 
      fundus photographs of diabetic patients were selected. DR severity varied from 
      grade 0 to 4, with 100 photographs for each grade. Following that, these were 
      diagnosed by both ophthalmologists and the intelligent technology, the results of 
      which were compared by applying the evaluation system. The system includes 
      primary, intermediate, and advanced evaluations, of which the intermediate 
      evaluation incorporated two methods. Main evaluation indicators were sensitivity, 
      specificity, and kappa value. RESULTS: The AI technology diagnosed 93 photographs 
      with no DR, 107 with mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), 107 with moderate NPDR, 
      108 with severe NPDR, and 85 with proliferative DR (PDR). The sensitivity, 
      specificity, and kappa value of the AI diagnoses in the primary evaluation were 
      98.8%, 88.0%, and 0.89, respectively. According to method 1 of the intermediate 
      evaluation, the sensitivity of AI diagnosis was 98.0%, specificity 97.0%, and the 
      kappa value 0.95. In method 2 of the intermediate evaluation, the sensitivity of 
      AI diagnosis was 95.5%, the specificity 99.3%, and kappa value 0.95. In the 
      advanced evaluation, the kappa value of the intelligent diagnosis was 0.86. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This article proposes an evaluation system for color fundus 
      photograph-based intelligent diagnostic technology of DR and demonstrates an 
      application of this system in a clinical setting. The results from this 
      evaluation system serve as the basis for the selection of scenarios in which DR 
      intelligent diagnostic technology can be applied.

TI  - Deep Learning Prediction of Response to Anti-VEGF among Diabetic Macular Edema 
      Patients: Treatment Response Analyzer System (TRAS).
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020312 [doi]
LID - 312
AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of visual impairment among 
      patients with diabetes mellitus. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factors 
      (Anti-VEGFs) are considered the first line in its management. The aim of this 
      research has been to develop a deep learning (DL) model for predicting response 
      to intravitreal anti-VEGF injections among DME patients. The research included 
      treatment naive DME patients who were treated with anti-VEGF. Patient's 
      pre-treatment and post-treatment clinical and macular optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) were assessed by retina specialists, who annotated pre-treatment 
      images for five prognostic features. Patients were also classified based on their 
      response to treatment in their post-treatment OCT into either good responder, 
      defined as a reduction of thickness by >25% or 50 µm by 3 months, or poor 
      responder. A novel modified U-net DL model for image segmentation, and another DL 
      EfficientNet-B3 model for response classification were developed and implemented 
      for predicting response to anti-VEGF injections among patients with DME. Finally, 
      the classification DL model was compared with different levels of ophthalmology 
      residents and specialists regarding response classification accuracy. The 
      segmentation deep learning model resulted in segmentation accuracy of 95.9%, with 
      a specificity of 98.9%, and a sensitivity of 87.9%. The classification accuracy 
      of classifying patients' images into good and poor responders reached 75%. Upon 
      comparing the model's performance with practicing ophthalmology residents, 
      ophthalmologists and retina specialists, the model's accuracy is comparable to 
      ophthalmologist's accuracy. The developed DL models can segment and predict 
      response to anti-VEGF treatment among DME patients with comparable accuracy to 
      general ophthalmologists. Further training on a larger dataset is nonetheless 
      needed to yield more accurate response predictions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the feasibility and clinical utility of artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and macular edema 
      (ME) by combining fundus photos and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in 
      a community hospital. METHODS: Fundus photos and OCT images were taken for 600 
      diabetic patients in a community hospital. Ophthalmologists graded these fundus 
      photos according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) 
      Severity Scale as the ground truth. Two existing trained AI models were used to 
      automatically classify the fundus images into DR grades according to ICDR, and to 
      detect concomitant ME from OCT images, respectively. The criteria for referral 
      were DR grades 2-4 and/or the presence of ME. The sensitivity and specificity of 
      AI grading were evaluated. The number of referable DR cases confirmed by 
      ophthalmologists and AI was calculated, respectively. RESULTS: DR was detected in 
      81 (13.5%) participants by ophthalmologists and in 94 (15.6%) by AI, and 45 
      (7.5%) and 53 (8.8%) participants were diagnosed with referable DR by 
      ophthalmologists and by AI, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and area 
      under the curve (AUC) of AI for detecting DR were 91.67%, 96.92% and 0.944, 
      respectively. For detecting referable DR, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of 
      AI were 97.78%, 98.38% and 0.981, respectively. ME was detected from OCT images 
      in 49 (8.2%) participants by ophthalmologists and in 57 (9.5%) by AI, and the 
      sensitivity, specificity and AUC of AI were 91.30%, 97.46% and 0.944, 
      respectively. When combining fundus photos and OCT images, the number of 
      referrals identified by ophthalmologists increased from 45 to 75 and from 53 to 
      85 by AI. CONCLUSION: AI-based DR screening has high sensitivity and specificity 
      and may feasibly improve the referral rate of community DR.

AB  - Understanding the mechanics of blood flow is necessary for developing insights 
      into mechanisms of physiology and vascular diseases in microcirculation. Given 
      the limitations of technologies available for assessing in vivo flow fields, in 
      vitro methods based on traditional microfluidic platforms have been developed to 
      mimic physiological conditions. However, existing methods lack the capability to 
      provide accurate assessment of these flow fields, particularly in vessels with 
      complex geometries. Conventional approaches to quantify flow fields rely either 
      on analyzing only visual images or on enforcing underlying physics without 
      considering visualization data, which could compromise accuracy of predictions. 
      Here, we present artificial-intelligence velocimetry (AIV) to quantify velocity 
      and stress fields of blood flow by integrating the imaging data with underlying 
      physics using physics-informed neural networks. We demonstrate the capability of 
      AIV by quantifying hemodynamics in microchannels designed to mimic 
      saccular-shaped microaneurysms (microaneurysm-on-a-chip, or MAOAC), which signify 
      common manifestations of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss 
      from blood-vessel damage in the retina in diabetic patients. We show that AIV 
      can, without any a priori knowledge of the inlet and outlet boundary conditions, 
      infer the two-dimensional (2D) flow fields from a sequence of 2D images of blood 
      flow in MAOAC, but also can infer three-dimensional (3D) flow fields using only 
      2D images, thanks to the encoded physics laws. AIV provides a unique paradigm 
      that seamlessly integrates images, experimental data, and underlying physics 
      using neural networks to automatically analyze experimental data and infer key 
      hemodynamic indicators that assess vascular injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effect of intraretinal (IRF) and 
      subretinal (SRF) fluid on visual outcomes for diabetic macular edema (DME) 
      patients treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) in 
      routine clinical practice. DESIGN: Optical coherence tomography scans were 
      analyzed with a deep-learning artificial intelligence software to quantify IRF, 
      SRF, and total retinal fluid (TRF) at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. 
      Predictive variables for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were evaluated with 
      linear mixed-effects regression models. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 220 DME eyes of 
      220 patients from the Cole Eye Institute at Cleveland Clinic. METHODS: 
      Retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study. RESULTS: BCVA improved from baseline 
      to 12 months (63.36 ± 14.72 to 68.49 ± 13.14 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Study letters, p < 0.001, respectively). Central subfield thickness improved from 
      baseline to 12 months (411.74 ± 129.7 to 335.94 ± 116.91 mm, p < 0.001, 
      respectively). Injection frequency per patient was 8.25 ± 2.5 injections over 12 
      months. The linear mixed-effects regression model in the foveal region for TRF, 
      IRF, and SRF volume at the fourth quartile showed BCVA losses of -8.29 letters 
      (range, -10.96 to -5.62 letters, p < 0.001), -7.52 letters (range, -10.3 to -4.74 
      letters, p < .001), and -6.93 letters (range, -10.54 to -3.41 letters, p < .001), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The highest quartile of TRF, IRF, and SRF volumes led 
      to worse visual outcomes after 12 months of anti-VEGF treatment in patients with 
      DME. Further studies designed to investigate the effect of anti-VEGF treatment on 
      retinal fluid morphology could provide greater insight into individualized DME 
      treatment.

AB  - The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging 
      faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a 
      diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients 
      with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer 
      learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of 
      conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence 
      tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts 
      in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We 
      also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the 
      regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general 
      applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest 
      X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and 
      referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, 
      resulting in improved clinical outcomes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - The main intention of mass screening programmes for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is 
      to detect and diagnose the disorder earlier than it leads to vision loss. 
      Automated analysis of retinal images has the likelihood to improve the efficacy 
      of screening programmes when compared over the manual image analysis. This 
      article plans to develop a framework for the detection of DR from the retinal 
      fundus images using three evaluations based on optic disc, blood vessels and 
      retinal abnormalities. Initially, the pre-processing steps like green channel 
      conversion and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation is done. Further, 
      the segmentation procedure starts with optic disc segmentation by open-close 
      watershed transform, blood vessel segmentation by grey level thresholding and 
      abnormality segmentation (hard exudates, haemorrhages, Microaneurysm and soft 
      exudates) by top hat transform and Gabor filtering mechanisms. From the three 
      segmented images, the feature like local binary pattern, texture energy 
      measurement, Shanon's and Kapur's entropy are extracted, which is subjected to 
      optimal feature selection process using the new hybrid optimisation algorithm 
      termed as Trial-based Bypass Improved Dragonfly Algorithm (TB - DA). These 
      features are given to hybrid machine learning algorithm with the combination of 
      NN and DBN. As a modification, the same hybrid TB - DA is used to enhance the 
      training of hybrid classifier, which outputs the categorisation as normal, mild, 
      moderate or severe images based on three components.

AB  - Human eye is one of the important organs in human body, with iris, pupil, sclera, 
      cornea, lens, retina and optic nerve. Many important eye diseases as well as 
      systemic diseases manifest themselves in the retina. The most widespread causes 
      of blindness in the industrialized world are glaucoma, Age Related Macular 
      Degeneration (ARMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macula Edema (DME). 
      The development of a retinal image analysis system is a demanding research topic 
      for early detection, progression analysis and diagnosis of eye diseases. Early 
      diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases are essential to prevent vision loss. 
      The huge and growing number of retinal disease affected patients, cost of current 
      hospital-based detection methods (by eye care specialists) and scarcity in the 
      number of ophthalmologists are the barriers to achieve the recommended screening 
      compliance in the patient who is at the risk of retinal diseases. Developing an 
      automated system which uses pattern recognition, computer vision and machine 
      learning to diagnose retinal diseases is a potential solution to this problem. 
      Damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina in the posterior part of the eye 
      due to diabetes is named as DR. Diabetes is a disease which occurs when the 
      pancreas does not secrete enough insulin or the body does not utilize it 
      properly. This disease slowly affects the circulatory system including that of 
      the retina. As diabetes intensifies, the vision of a patient may start 
      deteriorating and leading to DR. The retinal landmarks like OD and blood vessels, 
      white lesions and red lesions are segmented to develop automated screening system 
      for DR. DME is an advanced symptom of DR that can lead to irreversible vision 
      loss. DME is a general term defined as retinal thickening or exudates present 
      within 2 disk diameter of the fovea center; it can either focal or diffuse DME in 
      distribution. In this paper, review the algorithms used in diagnosis of DR and 
      DME.

TI  - Automatic severity grade classification of diabetic retinopathy using deformable 
      ladder Bi attention U-net and deep adaptive CNN.
PG  - 2091-2113
LID - 10.1007/s11517-023-02860-9 [doi]
AB  - Long-term exposure to diabetes mellitus leads to the formation of diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR), which can cause vision loss in working-age adults. Early stage 
      diagnosis of DR is highly essential for preventing vision loss and preserving 
      vision in people with diabetes. The motivation behind the severity grade 
      classification of DR is to develop an automated system that can assist 
      ophthalmologists and healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and management of 
      DR. However, existing methods suffer from variability in image quality, similar 
      structures of the normal and lesion regions, high dimensional features, 
      variability in disease manifestations, small datasets, high training loss, model 
      complexity, and overfitting, which leads to high misclassification errors in the 
      severity grading system. Hence, there is a need to develop an automated system 
      using improved deep learning techniques to provide a reliable and consistent 
      grading of DR severity with high classification accuracy using fundus images. To 
      solve these issues, we proposes a Deformable Ladder Bi attention U-shaped 
      encoder-decoder network and Deep Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network 
      (DLBUnet-DACNN) for accurate severity classification of DR. The DLBUnet performs 
      lesion segmentation that can be divided into three parts: the encoder, the 
      central processing module and the decoder. In the encoder part, deformable 
      convolution is used instead of convolution to learn different shapes of the 
      lesion by understanding the offset location. Afterwards, Ladder Atrous Spatial 
      Pyramidal Pooling (LASPP) using variable dilation rates is introduced in the 
      central processing module. LASPP enhance the tiny lesion features and variable 
      dilation rates avoid gridding effects and can learn better global context 
      information. Then the decoder part uses a bi-attention layer contains spatial and 
      channel attention, which can learn contour and edges of the lesion accurately. 
      Finally, the severity of DR is classified using a DACNN by extracting the 
      discriminative features from the segmentation results. Experiments are conducted 
      on the Messidor-2, Kaggle, and Messidor datasets. Our proposed method 
      DLBUnet-DACNN achieves better results in terms of accuracy of 98.2, recall of 
      0.987, kappa coefficient of 0.993, precision of 0.98, F1-score of 0.981, Matthews 
      Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.93 and Classification Success Index (CSI) of 
      0.96 when compared to existing methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of an AI-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      grading model in real-world community clinical setting. METHODS: Participants 
      with diabetes on record in the chosen community were recruited by health care 
      staffs in a primary clinic of Zhengzhou city, China. Retinal images were 
      prospectively collected during December 2018 and April 2019 based on 
      intent-to-screen principle. A pre-validated AI system based on deep learning 
      algorithm was deployed to screen DR graded according to the International 
      Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale. Kappa value of DR severity, the sensitivity, 
      specificity of detecting referable DR (RDR) and any DR were generated based on 
      the standard of the majority manual grading decision of a retina specialist 
      panel. RESULTS: Of the 193 eligible participants, 173 (89.6%) were readable with 
      at least one eye image. Mean [SD] age was 69.3 (9.0) years old. Total of 321 eyes 
      (83.2%) were graded both by AI and the specialist panel. The κ value in eye image 
      grading was 0.715. The sensitivity, specificity and area under curve for 
      detection of RDR were 84.6% (95% CI: 54.6- 98.1%), 98.0% (95% CI: 94.3-99.6%) and 
      0.913 (95% CI: 0.797-1.000), respectively. For detection of any DR, the upper 
      indicators were 90.0% (95% CI: 68.3-98.8), 96.6% (95% CI: 92.1-98.9) and 0.933 
      (95% CI: 0.933-1.000), respectively. CONCLUSION: The AI system showed relatively 
      good consistency with ophthalmologist diagnosis in DR grading, high specificity 
      and acceptable sensitivity for identifying RDR and any DR. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: It is feasible to apply AI-based DR screening in community. PRECIS: 
      Deployed in community real-world clinic setting, AI-based DR screening system 
      showed high specificity and acceptable sensitivity in identifying RDR and any DR. 
      Good DR diagnostic consistency was found between AI and manual grading. These 
      prospective evidences were essential for regulatory approval.

AB  - AIMS: To use machine learning (ML) to determine the relative contributions of 
      modifiable and non-modifiable clinical, metabolic, genetic, lifestyle and 
      socioeconomic factors on the risk of major eye diseases. METHODS: We conducted 
      analyses in a cross-sectional multi-ethnic population-based study (n=10 033 
      participants) and determined a range of modifiable and non-modifiable risk 
      factors of common eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), 
      non-diabetic-related retinopathy (NDR); early and late age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD); nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract; 
      and primary open-angle (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Risk 
      factors included individual characteristics, metabolic profiles, genetic 
      background, lifestyle patterns and socioeconomic status (n~100 risk factors). We 
      used gradient boosting machine to estimate the relative influence (RI) of each 
      risk factor. RESULTS: Among the range of risk factors studied, the highest 
      contributions were duration of diabetes for DR (RI=22.1%), and alcohol 
      consumption for NDR (RI=6.4%). For early and late AMD, genetic background 
      (RI~20%) and age (RI~15%) contributed the most. Axial length was the main risk 
      factor of PSC (RI=30.8%). For PACG, socioeconomic factor (mainly educational 
      level) had the highest influence (20%). POAG was the disease with the highest 
      contribution of modifiable risk factors (cumulative RI~35%), followed by PACG 
      (cumulative RI ~30%), retinopathy (cumulative RI between 20% and 30%) and late 
      AMD (cumulative RI ~20%). CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the utility of ML in 
      identifying factors with the highest contributions. Risk factors possibly 
      amenable to interventions were intraocular pressure (IOP) and Body Mass Index 
      (BMI) for glaucoma, alcohol consumption for NDR and levels of HbA1c for DR.

AB  - Early diagnosis of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy has had the 
      attention of many researchers. Deep learning through the introduction of 
      convolutional neural networks has become a prominent solution for image-related 
      tasks such as classification and segmentation. Most tasks in image classification 
      are handled by deep CNNs pretrained and evaluated on imagenet dataset. However, 
      these models do not always translate to the best result on other datasets. 
      Devising a neural network manually from scratch based on heuristics may not lead 
      to an optimal model as there are numerous hyperparameters in play. In this paper, 
      we use two nature-inspired swarm algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
      and ant colony optimization (ACO) to obtain TDCN models to perform classification 
      of fundus images into severity classes. The power of swarm algorithms is used to 
      search for various combinations of convolutional, pooling, and normalization 
      layers to provide the best model for the task. It is observed that TDCN-PSO 
      outperforms imagenet models and existing literature, while TDCN-ACO achieves 
      faster architecture search. The best TDCN model achieves an accuracy of 90.3%, 
      AUC ROC of 0.956, and a Cohen's kappa score of 0.967. The results were compared 
      with the previous studies to show that the proposed TDCN models exhibit superior 
      performance.

TI  - SplitAVG: A Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Deep Learning Method for Medical 
      Imaging.
PG  - 4635-4644
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3185956 [doi]
AB  - Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm for enabling collaboratively 
      training deep learning models without sharing patient data. However, the data 
      from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across institutions, which 
      may reduce the performance of models trained using federated learning. In this 
      study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning method, 
      SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from data heterogeneity in federated 
      learning. Unlike previous federated methods that require complex heuristic 
      training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG leverages the simple network 
      split and feature map concatenation strategies to encourage the federated model 
      training an unbiased estimator of the target data distribution. We compare 
      SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated learning methods, using centrally 
      hosted training data as the baseline on a suite of both synthetic and real-world 
      federated datasets. We find that the performance of models trained using all the 
      comparison federated learning methods degraded significantly with the increasing 
      degrees of data heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable 
      results to the baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 
      96.2% of the accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the 
      baseline in a diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age 
      prediction dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We 
      conclude that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from 
      variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results also 
      show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base convolutional neural networks 
      (CNNs) and generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks. The code is 
      publicly available at https://github.com/zm17943/SplitAVG.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of retinal exudates using a residual encoder-decoder 
      architecture in diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 1443-1460
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24345 [doi]
AB  - Exudates are a common sign of diabetic retinopathy, which is a disease that 
      affects the blood vessels in the retina. Early detection of exudates is critical 
      to avoiding vision problems through continuous screening and treatment. In 
      traditional clinical practice, the involved lesions are manually detected using 
      photographs of the fundus. However, this task is cumbersome and time-consuming 
      and requires intense effort due to the small size of the lesion and the low 
      contrast of the images. Thus, computer-assisted diagnosis of retinal disease 
      based on the detection of red lesions has been actively explored recently. In 
      this paper, we present a comparison of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      architectures and propose a residual CNN with residual skip connections to reduce 
      the parameter for the semantic segmentation of exudates in retinal images. A 
      suitable image augmentation technique is used to improve the performance of 
      network architecture. The proposed network can robustly segment exudates with 
      high accuracy, which makes it suitable for diabetic retinopathy screening. A 
      comparative performance analysis of three benchmark databases: E-ophtha, 
      DIARETDB1, and Hamilton Ophthalmology Institute's Macular Edema, is presented. 
      The proposed method achieves a precision of 0.95, 0.92, 0.97, accuracy of 0.98, 
      0.98, 0.98, sensitivity of 0.97, 0.95, 0.95, specificity of 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, and 
      area under the curve of 0.97, 0.94, and 0.96, respectively. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: 
      The research focuses on the detection and segmentation of exudates in diabetic 
      retinopathy, a disease affecting the retina. Early detection of exudates is 
      important to avoid vision problems and requires continuous screening and 
      treatment. Currently, manual detection is time-consuming and requires intense 
      effort. The authors compare qualitative results of the state-of-the-art 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and propose a computer-assisted 
      diagnosis approach based on deep learning, using a residual CNN with residual 
      skip connections to reduce parameters. The proposed method is evaluated on three 
      benchmark databases and demonstrates high accuracy and suitability for diabetic 
      retinopathy screening.

AB  - In response to the growing number of diabetes cases worldwide, Our study 
      addresses the escalating issue of diabetic eye disease (DED), a significant 
      contributor to vision loss globally, through a pioneering approach. We propose a 
      novel integration of a Genetic Grey Wolf Optimization (G-GWO) algorithm with a 
      Fully Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network (FCEDN), further enhanced by a Kernel 
      Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for refined image segmentation and disease 
      classification. This innovative combination leverages the genetic algorithm and 
      grey wolf optimization to boost the FCEDN's efficiency, enabling precise 
      detection of DED stages and differentiation among disease types. Tested across 
      diverse datasets, including IDRiD, DR-HAGIS, and ODIR, our model showcased 
      superior performance, achieving classification accuracies between 98.5% to 98.8%, 
      surpassing existing methods. This advancement sets a new standard in DED 
      detection and offers significant potential for automating fundus image analysis, 
      reducing reliance on manual examination, and improving patient care efficiency. 
      Our findings are crucial to enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in 
      DED management.

TI  - SSiT: Saliency-Guided Self-Supervised Image Transformer for Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Grading.
PG  - 2806-2817
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2024.3362878 [doi]
AB  - Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has been widely applied to learn image 
      representations through exploiting unlabeled images. However, it has not been 
      fully explored in the medical image analysis field. In this work, Saliency-guided 
      Self-Supervised image Transformer (SSiT) is proposed for Diabetic Retinopathy 
      (DR) grading from fundus images. We novelly introduce saliency maps into SSL, 
      with a goal of guiding self-supervised pre-training with domain-specific prior 
      knowledge. Specifically, two saliency-guided learning tasks are employed in SSiT: 
      1) Saliency-guided contrastive learning is conducted based on the momentum 
      contrast, wherein fundus images' saliency maps are utilized to remove trivial 
      patches from the input sequences of the momentum-updated key encoder. Thus, the 
      key encoder is constrained to provide target representations focusing on salient 
      regions, guiding the query encoder to capture salient features. 2) The query 
      encoder is trained to predict the saliency segmentation, encouraging the 
      preservation of fine-grained information in the learned representations. To 
      assess our proposed method, four publicly-accessible fundus image datasets are 
      adopted. One dataset is employed for pre-training, while the three others are 
      used to evaluate the pre-trained models' performance on downstream DR grading. 
      The proposed SSiT significantly outperforms other representative state-of-the-art 
      SSL methods on all downstream datasets and under various evaluation settings. For 
      example, SSiT achieves a Kappa score of 81.88% on the DDR dataset under 
      fine-tuning evaluation, outperforming all other ViT-based SSL methods by at least 
      9.48%.

TI  - Assessing the Need for Referral in Automatic Diabetic Retinopathy Detection.
PG  - 3391-8
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2013.2278845 [doi]
AB  - Emerging technologies in health care aim at reducing unnecessary visits to 
      medical specialists, minimizing overall cost of treatment and optimizing the 
      number of patients seen by each doctor. This paper explores image recognition for 
      the screening of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can lead 
      to blindness if not discovered in its initial stages. Many previous reports on DR 
      imaging focus on the segmentation of the retinal image, on quality assessment, 
      and on the analysis of presence of DR-related lesions. Although this study has 
      advanced the detection of individual DR lesions from retinal images, the simple 
      presence of any lesion is not enough to decide on the need for referral of a 
      patient. Deciding if a patient should be referred to a doctor is an essential 
      requirement for the deployment of an automated screening tool for rural and 
      remote communities. We introduce an algorithm to make that decision based on the 
      fusion of results by metaclassification. The input of the metaclassifier is the 
      output of several lesion detectors, creating a powerful high-level feature 
      representation for the retinal images. We explore alternatives for the 
      bag-of-visual-words (BoVW)-based lesion detectors, which critically depends on 
      the choices of coding and pooling the low-level local descriptors. The final 
      classification approach achieved an area under the curve of 93.4% using SOFT-MAX 
      BoVW (soft-assignment coding/max pooling), without the need of normalizing the 
      high-level feature vector of scores.

AB  - There has been a recent surge in the number of publications centered on the use 
      of artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose various systemic diseases. The Food 
      and Drug Administration has approved several algorithms for use in clinical 
      practice. In ophthalmology, most advances in AI relate to diabetic retinopathy, 
      which is a disease process with agreed upon diagnostic and classification 
      criteria. However, this is not the case for glaucoma, which is a relatively 
      complex disease without agreed-upon diagnostic criteria. Moreover, currently 
      available public datasets that focus on glaucoma have inconstant label quality, 
      further complicating attempts at training AI algorithms efficiently. In this 
      perspective paper, we discuss specific details related to developing AI models 
      for glaucoma and suggest potential steps to overcome current limitations.

LID - 10.1515/cclm-2023-0775 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the metabolic fingerprints of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes using a newly-developed laser 
      desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) platform assisted by ferric 
      particles. METHODS: Metabolic fingerprinting was performed using a ferric 
      particle-assisted LDI-MS platform. A nested population-based case-control study 
      was performed on 216 DR cases and 216 control individuals with type 2 diabetes. 
      RESULTS: DR cases and control individuals with type 2 diabetes were comparable 
      for a list of clinical factors. The newly-developed LDI-MS platform allowed us to 
      draw the blueprint of plasma metabolic fingerprints from participants with and 
      without DR. The neural network afforded diagnostic performance with an average 
      area under curve value of 0.928 for discovery cohort and 0.905 for validation 
      cohort (95 % confidence interval: 0.902-0.954 and 0.845-0.965, respectively). 
      Tandem MS and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS with ultrahigh 
      resolution identified seven specific metabolites that were significantly 
      associated with DR in fully adjusted models. Of these metabolites, 
      dihydrobiopterin, phosphoserine, N-arachidonoylglycine, and 3-methylhistamine 
      levels in plasma were first reported to show the associations. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      work advances the design of metabolic analysis for DR and holds the potential to 
      promise as an efficient tool for clinical management of DR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To explore the value of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography 
      (OCTA) metrics in the early diagnosis of vascular complications in diabetes. 
      METHODS: All participants underwent OCTA with a swept-source OCT device. 
      Automated measurements of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, vessel density 
      (VD), and blood flow density (BFD) of both 3 × 3 and 6 × 6 windows were then 
      obtained after a quality check. RESULTS: Diagnostic models based on multiple risk 
      factors were developed separately for diabetic retinopathy and carotid 
      atherosclerosis using random forest and multivariate logistic regression methods. 
      The addition of specific OCTA metrics improved the diagnostic prediction of DR 
      compared with the models of risk factors alone (Inner Retinal Blood Flow Density 
      in 3 × 3 window, IRBFD; Brier score 0.124 vs. 0.149; AUC, 0.887 vs. 0.836) 
      (Central Retinal Blood Flow Density in 3 × 3 window, CRBFD; Brier score 0.142 vs. 
      0.149; AUC, 0.851 vs. 0.836). Adding diabetic peripheral vascular disease (DPVD) 
      indicator improved the prediction of carotid atherosclerosis (Brier score, 
      0.180 vs. 0.192; AUC, 0.802 vs. 0.781. The FAZ in the 3 × 3 window also achieved 
      this effect when targeting only T2DM patients (AUC, 0.797 vs. 0.766; Brier score, 
      0.183 vs. 0.195). CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on IRBFD and CRBFD in the 3 × 3 window of 
      OCTA allows for a more sensitive prediction of the occurrence of DR in diabetic 
      patients. Meanwhile, the quantitative microvascular information provided by OCTA 
      and the occurrence of DPVD may be crucial for diagnosing carotid atherosclerosis. 
      For T2DM patients, we also propose the possibility of FAZ in the 3 × 3 window as 
      a potential diagnostic indicator.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programmes feature-based 
      grading guidelines are used by human graders. However, recent deep learning 
      approaches have focused on end to end learning, based on labelled data at the 
      whole image level. Most predictions from such software offer a direct grading 
      output without information about the retinal features responsible for the grade. 
      In this work, we demonstrate a feature based retinal image analysis system, which 
      aims to support flexible grading and monitor progression. METHODS: The system was 
      evaluated against images that had been graded according to two different grading 
      systems; The International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular 
      Oedema Severity Scale and the UK's National Screening Committee guidelines. 
      RESULTS: External evaluation on large datasets collected from three nations 
      (Kenya, Saudi Arabia and China) was carried out. On a DR referable level, 
      sensitivity did not vary significantly between different DR grading schemes 
      (91.2-94.2.0%) and there were excellent specificity values above 93% in all image 
      sets. More importantly, no cases of severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR 
      or DMO were missed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the potential of an AI 
      feature-based DR grading system that is not constrained to any specific grading 
      scheme.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the alteration in the macular microvascular in type 2 diabetic 
      patients with peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and without peripheral neuropathy 
      (NDPN) by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and explore the 
      correlation between retinal microvascular abnormalities and DPN disease. Methods: 
      Twenty-seven healthy controls (42 eyes), 36 NDPN patients (62 eyes), and 27 DPN 
      patients (40 eyes) were included. OCTA was used to image the macula in the 
      superficial vascular complex (SVC) and deep vascular complex (DVC). In addition, 
      a state-of-the-art deep learning method was employed to quantify the 
      microvasculature of the two capillary plexuses in all participants using vascular 
      length density (VLD). Results: Compared with the healthy control group, the 
      average VLD values of patients with DPN in SVC (p = 0.010) and DVC (p = 0.011) 
      were significantly lower. Compared with NDPN, DPN patients showed significantly 
      reduced VLD values in the SVC (p = 0.006) and DVC (p = 0.001). Also, DPN patients 
      showed lower VLD values (p < 0.05) in the nasal, superior, temporal and inferior 
      sectors of the inner ring of the SVC when compared with controls; VLD values in 
      NDPN patients were lower in the nasal section of the inner ring of SVC (p < 0.05) 
      compared with healthy controls. VLD values in the DVC (AUC = 0.736, p < 0.001) of 
      the DPN group showed a higher ability to discriminate microvascular damage when 
      compared with NDPN. Conclusion: OCTA based on deep learning could be potentially 
      used in clinical practice as a new indicator in the early diagnosis of DM with 
      and without DPN.

AB  - Independent validation studies of automatic diabetic retinopathy screening 
      systems have recently shown a drop of screening performance on external data. 
      Beyond diabetic retinopathy, this study investigates the generalizability of deep 
      learning (DL) algorithms for screening various ocular anomalies in fundus 
      photographs, across heterogeneous populations and imaging protocols. The 
      following datasets are considered: OPHDIAT (France, diabetic population), 
      OphtaMaine (France, general population), RIADD (India, general population) and 
      ODIR (China, general population). Two multi-disease DL algorithms were developed: 
      a Single-Dataset (SD) network, trained on the largest dataset (OPHDIAT), and a 
      Multiple-Dataset (MD) network, trained on multiple datasets simultaneously. To 
      assess their generalizability, both algorithms were evaluated whenever training 
      and test data originate from overlapping datasets or from disjoint datasets. The 
      SD network achieved a mean per-disease area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (mAUC) of 0.9571 on OPHDIAT. However, it generalized poorly 
      to the other three datasets (mAUC < 0.9). When all four datasets were involved in 
      training, the MD network significantly outperformed the SD network (p = 0.0058), 
      indicating improved generality. However, in leave-one-dataset-out experiments, 
      performance of the MD network was significantly lower on populations unseen 
      during training than on populations involved in training (p < 0.0001), indicating 
      imperfect generalizability.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Early 
      detection and treatment are crucial to prevent vision loss, making accurate and 
      timely diagnosis critical. Deep learning technology has shown promise in the 
      automated diagnosis of DR, and in particular, multi-lesion segmentation tasks. In 
      this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for DR segmentation that 
      incorporates hyperbolic embeddings and a spatial prior module. The proposed model 
      is primarily built on a traditional Vision Transformer encoder and further 
      enhanced by incorporating a spatial prior module for image convolution and 
      feature continuity, followed by feature interaction processing using the spatial 
      feature injector and extractor. Hyperbolic embeddings are used to classify 
      feature matrices from the model at the pixel level. We evaluated the proposed 
      model's performance on the publicly available datasets and compared it with other 
      widely used DR segmentation models. The results show that our model outperforms 
      these widely used DR segmentation models. The incorporation of hyperbolic 
      embeddings and a spatial prior module into the Vision Transformer-based model 
      significantly improves the accuracy of DR segmentation. The hyperbolic embeddings 
      enable us to better capture the underlying geometric structure of the feature 
      matrices, which is important for accurate segmentation. The spatial prior module 
      improves the continuity of the features and helps to better distinguish between 
      lesions and normal tissues. Overall, our proposed model has potential for 
      clinical use in automated DR diagnosis, improving accuracy and speed of 
      diagnosis. Our study shows that the integration of hyperbolic embeddings and a 
      spatial prior module with a Vision Transformer-based model improves the 
      performance of DR segmentation models. Future research can explore the 
      application of our model to other medical imaging tasks, as well as further 
      optimization and validation in real-world clinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep learning classifiers provide the most accurate means of 
      automatically diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) and its angiography (OCTA). The power of these models is 
      attributable in part to the inclusion of hidden layers that provide the 
      complexity required to achieve a desired task. However, hidden layers also render 
      algorithm outputs difficult to interpret. Here we introduce a novel biomarker 
      activation map (BAM) framework based on generative adversarial learning that 
      allows clinicians to verify and understand classifiers' decision-making. METHODS: 
      A data set including 456 macular scans were graded as non-referable or referable 
      DR based on current clinical standards. A DR classifier that was used to evaluate 
      our BAM was first trained based on this data set. The BAM generation framework 
      was designed by combing two U-shaped generators to provide meaningful 
      interpretability to this classifier. The main generator was trained to take 
      referable scans as input and produce an output that would be classified by the 
      classifier as non-referable. The BAM is then constructed as the difference image 
      between the output and input of the main generator. To ensure that the BAM only 
      highlights classifier-utilized biomarkers an assistant generator was trained to 
      do the opposite, producing scans that would be classified as referable by the 
      classifier from non-referable scans. RESULTS: The generated BAMs highlighted 
      known pathologic features including nonperfusion area and retinal fluid. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: A fully interpretable classifier based on these 
      highlights could help clinicians better utilize and verify automated DR 
      diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to identify recent research trends on diabetic macular edema 
      (DME) and focus on publications from different countries, institutions, and 
      authors. METHODS: We retrieved and analyzed data from January 1, 2003 to December 
      31, 2022 on the DME research field from the Web of Science Core Collection 
      (WoSCC) database. Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer were applied to perform 
      visualization analysis and evaluate the trends. RESULTS: A total of 4482 
      publications were identified, and the annual global publications increased 
      steadily, from 36 to 390, during this period. The United States (1339 
      publications, 71,754 citations), Johns Hopkins University (176 publications, 
      17,015 citations), and Bressler NM (76 publications, 9621 citations) were the 
      most influential and productive countries, institutions, and authors, 
      respectively. The top 100 keywords were classified into five clusters: (1) 
      therapy and adverse effects of DME; (2) clinical biomarkers of DME; (3) 
      mechanistic research on DME; (4) improving bioavailability and efficacy; and (5) 
      early diagnosis of diabetic complications. "Diabetic macular edema," 
      "retinopathy," "ranibizumab," and "optical coherence tomography angiography" were 
      the most frequent keywords. Regarding the average appearing years (AAYs) of the 
      keywords, "deep learning" (AAY:2020.83), "optical coherence tomography 
      angiography" (AAY:2019.59), "intravitreal Aflibercept" (AAY:2019.29), and 
      "dexamethasone implant" (AAY:2019.20) were recognized as the hotspots of the DME 
      research area in the short run. CONCLUSION: In the past two decades, the United 
      States was in master status in DME research. Although intravitreal drug injection 
      has been the mainstream therapy for a long time, the effectiveness of different 
      drugs, such as dexamethasone, new solutions for drug delivery, such as 
      intravitreal implantation, and more accurate tools for the classification and 
      follow-up of DME patients, such as deep learning systems, are still research 
      hotspots.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the ability of the pix2pix generative adversarial network 
      (pix2pix GAN) to synthesize clinically useful optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      color-coded macular thickness maps based on a modest-sized original fluorescein 
      angiography (FA) dataset and the reverse, to be used as a plausible alternative 
      to either imaging technique in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). 
      METHODS: Original images of 1,195 eyes of 708 nonconsecutive diabetic patients 
      with or without DME were retrospectively analyzed. OCT macular thickness maps and 
      corresponding FA images were preprocessed for use in training and testing the 
      proposed pix2pix GAN. The best quality synthesized images using the test set were 
      selected based on the Fréchet inception distance score, and their quality was 
      studied subjectively by image readers and objectively by calculating the peak 
      signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and Hamming distance. We also 
      used original and synthesized images in a trained deep convolutional neural 
      network (DCNN) to plot the difference between synthesized images and their 
      ground-truth analogues and calculate the learned perceptual image patch 
      similarity metric. RESULTS: The pix2pix GAN-synthesized images showed plausible 
      subjectively and objectively assessed quality, which can provide a clinically 
      useful alternative to either image modality. CONCLUSION: Using the pix2pix GAN to 
      synthesize mutually dependent OCT color-coded macular thickness maps or FA images 
      can overcome issues related to machine unavailability or clinical situations that 
      preclude the performance of either imaging technique. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - The fovea is a depression in the center of the macula and is the site of the 
      highest visual acuity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has contributed 
      considerably in elucidating the pathologic changes in the fovea and is now being 
      considered as an accompanying imaging method in drug development, such as 
      antivascular endothelial growth factor and its safety profiling. Because animal 
      numbers are limited in preclinical studies and automatized image evaluation tools 
      have not yet been routinely employed, essential reference data describing the 
      morphologic variations in macular thickness in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys are 
      sparse to nonexistent. A hybrid machine learning algorithm was applied for 
      automated OCT image processing and measurements of central retina thickness and 
      surface area values. Morphological variations and the effects of sex and 
      geographical origin were determined. Based on our findings, the fovea parameters 
      are specific to the geographic origin. Despite morphological similarities among 
      cynomolgus monkeys, considerable variations in the foveolar contour, even within 
      the same species but from different geographic origins, were found. The results 
      of the reference database show that not only the entire retinal thickness, but 
      also the macular subfields, should be considered when designing preclinical 
      studies and in the interpretation of foveal data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual impairment 
      and blindness. Consequently, numerous deep learning models have been developed 
      for the early detection of DR. Safety-critical applications employed in medical 
      diagnosis must be robust to distribution shifts. Previous studies have focused on 
      model performance under distribution shifts using natural image datasets such as 
      ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and SVHN. However, there is a lack of research specifically 
      investigating the performance using medical image datasets. To address this gap, 
      we investigated trends under distribution shifts using fundus image datasets. 
      METHODS: We used the EyePACS dataset for DR diagnosis, introduced noise specific 
      to fundus images, and evaluated the performance of ResNet, Swin-Transformer, and 
      MLP-Mixer models under a distribution shift. The discriminative ability was 
      evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve 
      (ROC-AUC), while the calibration ability was evaluated using the monotonic sweep 
      calibration error (ECE sweep). RESULTS: Swin-Transformer exhibited a higher 
      ROC-AUC than ResNet under all types of noise and displayed a smaller reduction in 
      the ROC-AUC due to noise. ECE sweep did not show a consistent trend across 
      different model architectures. CONCLUSIONS: Swin-Transformer consistently 
      demonstrated superior discrimination compared to ResNet. This trend persisted 
      even under unique distribution shifts in the fundus images.

AB  - AIM: To explore and evaluate an appropriate deep learning system (DLS) for the 
      detection of 12 major fundus diseases using colour fundus photography. METHODS: 
      Diagnostic performance of a DLS was tested on the detection of normal fundus and 
      12 major fundus diseases including referable diabetic retinopathy, pathologic 
      myopic retinal degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, 
      retinal detachment, wet and dry age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal 
      membrane, macula hole, possible glaucomatous optic neuropathy, papilledema and 
      optic nerve atrophy. The DLS was developed with 56 738 images and tested with 
      8176 images from one internal test set and two external test sets. The comparison 
      with human doctors was also conducted. RESULTS: The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curves of the DLS on the internal test set and the two 
      external test sets were 0.950 (95% CI 0.942 to 0.957) to 0.996 (95% CI 0.994 to 
      0.998), 0.931 (95% CI 0.923 to 0.939) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000) and 0.934 
      (95% CI 0.929 to 0.938) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000), with sensitivities of 
      80.4% (95% CI 79.1% to 81.6%) to 97.3% (95% CI 96.7% to 97.8%), 64.6% (95% CI 
      63.0% to 66.1%) to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%) and 68.0% (95% CI 67.1% to 68.9%) 
      to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), respectively, and specificities of 89.7% (95% CI 
      88.8% to 90.7%) to 98.1% (95%CI 97.7% to 98.6%), 78.7% (95% CI 77.4% to 80.0%) to 
      99.6% (95% CI 99.4% to 99.8%) and 88.1% (95% CI 87.4% to 88.7%) to 98.7% (95% CI 
      98.5% to 99.0%), respectively. When compared with human doctors, the DLS obtained 
      a higher diagnostic sensitivity but lower specificity. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      DLS is effective in diagnosing normal fundus and 12 major fundus diseases, and 
      thus has much potential for fundus diseases screening in the real world.

AB  - Traditionally, abnormalities of the retinal vasculature and perfusion in retinal 
      vascular disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vascular occlusions, 
      have been visualized with dye-based fluorescein angiography (FA). Optical 
      coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a newer, alternative modality for 
      imaging the retinal vasculature, which has some advantages over FA, such as its 
      dye-free, non-invasive nature, and depth resolution. The depth resolution of OCTA 
      allows for characterization of the retinal microvasculature in distinct anatomic 
      layers, and commercial OCTA platforms also provide automated quantitative 
      vascular and perfusion metrics. Quantitative and qualitative OCTA analysis in 
      various retinal vascular disorders has facilitated the detection of pre-clinical 
      vascular changes, greater understanding of known clinical signs, and the 
      development of imaging biomarkers to prognosticate and guide treatment. With 
      further technological improvements, such as a greater field of view and better 
      image quality processing algorithms, it is likely that OCTA will play an integral 
      role in the study and management of retinal vascular disorders. Artificial 
      intelligence methods-in particular, deep learning-show promise in refining the 
      insights to be gained from the use of OCTA in retinal vascular disorders. This 
      review aims to summarize the current literature on this imaging modality in 
      relation to common retinal vascular disorders.

      Detection: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e57292
LID - 10.2196/57292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of 
      diabetes mellitus. The global burden is immense with a worldwide prevalence of 
      8.5%. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated the 
      potential to transform the landscape of ophthalmology with earlier detection and 
      management of DR. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to provide an update and evaluate 
      the accuracy and current diagnostic ability of AI in detecting DR versus 
      ophthalmologists. Additionally, this review will highlight the potential of AI 
      integration to enhance DR screening, management, and disease progression. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of the current landscape of AI's role in DR will be 
      undertaken, guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analysis) model. Relevant peer-reviewed papers published in 
      English will be identified by searching 4 international databases: PubMed, 
      Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Eligible 
      studies will include randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and 
      cohort studies published on or after 2022 that evaluate AI's performance in 
      retinal imaging detection of DR in diverse adult populations. Studies that focus 
      on specific comorbid conditions, nonimage-based applications of AI, or those 
      lacking a direct comparison group or clear methodology will be excluded. Selected 
      papers will be independently assessed for bias by 2 review authors (JS and DM) 
      using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for systematic 
      reviews. Upon systematic review completion, if it is determined that there are 
      sufficient data, a meta-analysis will be performed. Data synthesis will use a 
      quantitative model. Statistical software such as RevMan and STATA will be used to 
      produce a random-effects meta-regression model to pool data from selected 
      studies. RESULTS: Using selected search queries across multiple databases, we 
      accumulated 3494 studies regarding our topic of interest, of which 1588 were 
      duplicates, leaving 1906 unique research papers to review and analyze. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol outlines a 
      comprehensive evaluation of AI for DR detection. This active study is anticipated 
      to assess the current accuracy of AI methods in detecting DR. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Validation and Clinical Applicability of Whole-Volume Automated Segmentation of 
      Optical Coherence Tomography in Retinal Disease Using Deep Learning.
PG  - 964-973

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Quantitative volumetric measures of retinal disease in optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) scans are infeasible to perform owing to the time 
      required for manual grading. Expert-level deep learning systems for automatic OCT 
      segmentation have recently been developed. However, the potential clinical 
      applicability of these systems is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a deep 
      learning model for whole-volume segmentation of 4 clinically important 
      pathological features and assess clinical applicability. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study used OCT data from 173 patients with a total 
      of 15 558 B-scans, treated at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The data set included 2 
      common OCT devices and 2 macular conditions: wet age-related macular degeneration 
      (107 scans) and diabetic macular edema (66 scans), covering the full range of 
      severity, and from 3 points during treatment. Two expert graders performed 
      pixel-level segmentations of intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, subretinal 
      hyperreflective material, and pigment epithelial detachment, including all 
      B-scans in each OCT volume, taking as long as 50 hours per scan. Quantitative 
      evaluation of whole-volume model segmentations was performed. Qualitative 
      evaluation of clinical applicability by 3 retinal experts was also conducted. 
      Data were collected from June 1, 2012, to January 31, 2017, for set 1 and from 
      January 1 to December 31, 2017, for set 2; graded between November 2018 and 
      January 2020; and analyzed from February 2020 to November 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Rating and stack ranking for clinical applicability by retinal 
      specialists, model-grader agreement for voxelwise segmentations, and total volume 
      evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, and intraclass 
      correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Among the 173 patients included in the 
      analysis (92 [53%] women), qualitative assessment found that automated 
      whole-volume segmentation ranked better than or comparable to at least 1 expert 
      grader in 127 scans (73%; 95% CI, 66%-79%). A neutral or positive rating was 
      given to 135 model segmentations (78%; 95% CI, 71%-84%) and 309 expert gradings 
      (2 per scan) (89%; 95% CI, 86%-92%). The model was rated neutrally or positively 
      in 86% to 92% of diabetic macular edema scans and 53% to 87% of age-related 
      macular degeneration scans. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.33 (95% CI, 
      0.08-0.96) to 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90-0.99). Dice similarity coefficients ranged from 
      0.43 (95% CI, 0.29-0.66) to 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-0.85). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      This deep learning-based segmentation tool provided clinically useful measures of 
      retinal disease that would otherwise be infeasible to obtain. Qualitative 
      evaluation was additionally important to reveal clinical applicability for both 
      care management and research.

TI  - A Metabolism-Based Interpretable Machine Learning Prediction Model for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Risk: A Cross-Sectional Study in Chinese Patients with Type 2 
      Diabetes.

AB  - The burden of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is increasing, and the sensitive 
      biomarkers of the disease were not enough. Studies have found that the metabolic 
      profile, such as amino acid (AA) and acylcarnitine (AcylCN), in the early stages 
      of DR patients might have changed, indicating the potential of metabolites to 
      become new biomarkers. We are amid to construct a metabolite-based prediction 
      model for DR risk. This study was conducted on type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients 
      with or without DR. Logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) 
      prediction models were constructed using the traditional clinical features and 
      the screening features, respectively. Assessing the predictive power of the 
      models in terms of both discrimination and calibration, the optimal model was 
      interpreted using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the effect 
      of features on prediction. Finally, the XGBoost model incorporating AA and AcylCN 
      variables had the best comprehensive evaluation (ROCAUC = 0.82, PRAUC = 0.44, 
      Brier score = 0.09). C18 : 1OH lower than 0.04 μmol/L, C18 : 1 lower than 
      0.70 μmol/L, threonine higher than 27.0 μmol/L, and tyrosine lower than 
      36.0 μmol/L were associated with an increased risk of developing DR. 
      Phenylalanine higher than 52.0 μmol/L was associated with a decreased risk of 
      developing DR. In conclusion, our study mainly used AAs and AcylCNs to construct 
      an interpretable XGBoost model to predict the risk of developing DR in T2D 
      patients which is beneficial in identifying high-risk groups and preventing or 
      delaying the onset of DR. In addition, our study proposed possible risk cut-off 
      values for DR of C18 : 1OH, C18 : 1, threonine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a diabetic microangiopathy caused by diabetes, affects 
      approximately 93 million people, worldwide. However, the drugs used to treat DR 
      have limited efficacy and the variety of side effects. This is possibly because 
      the complicated pathogenesis of DR is associated with multiple proteins. In this 
      work, we attempted to identify potential drugs against DR-associated proteins and 
      predict potential targets for drugs using in silico prediction of 
      chemical-protein interactions (CPI) based on multitarget quantitative 
      structure-activity relationship (mt-QSAR) method. Therefore, we developed 128 
      binary classifiers to predict the CPI for 15 DR targets using random forest (RF), 
      k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) 
      algorithms with MACCS, extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP6) fingerprints, 
      and protein descriptors. In order to facilitate discovery of the novel drugs and 
      target identification using the 128 binary classifiers, a free web server (DRDB) 
      was developed. Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP), composed of Salvia 
      miltiorrhiza, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, is commonly used in the treatment 
      of cardiovascular diseases. To explore the applicability of DRDB, the potential 
      CPIs of CDDP in treatment of DR were investigated based on DRDB. In vitro 
      experimental validation demonstrated that cryptotanshinone and protocatechuic 
      acid, two key components of CDDP, are capable of targeting ICAM-1 which is one of 
      the key target of DR. We hope that this work can facilitate development of more 
      effective clinical strategies for the treatment of DR.

LID - 10.1080/09286586.2023.2285971 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Risk factors (RFs), like 'body mass index (BMI),' 'age,' and 'gender' 
      correlate with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis and have been widely studied. 
      This study examines how these three secondary RFs independently affect the 
      predictive capacity of primary RFs. METHODS: The dataset consisted of four 
      population-based studies on the prevalence of DR and associated RFs in India 
      between 2001 and 2010. An Autoencoder was employed to categorize RFs as primary 
      or secondary. This study evaluated six primary RFs coupled independently with 
      each secondary RF on five machine-learning models. RESULTS: The secondary RF 
      'gender' gave a maximum increase in Area under the curve (AUC) score to predict 
      DR when combined separately with 'insulin treatment,' 'fasting plasma glucose,' 
      'hypertension history,' and 'glycosylated hemoglobin' with a maximum increase in 
      AUC for the Naive Bayes model from 0.573 to 0.646, for the Support Vector 
      Machines (SVM) model from 0.644 to 0.691, for the SVM model from 0.487 to 0.607, 
      and for the Decision Tree model from 0.8 to 0.848, respectively. The secondary 
      RFs 'age' and 'BMI' gave a maximum increase in AUC score to predict DR when 
      combined separately with 'diabetes mellitus duration' and 'systolic blood 
      pressure,' with a maximum increase in AUC for the SVM model from 0.389 to 0.621, 
      and for the Decision Tree model from 0.617 to 0.713, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      The risk factor 'gender' was the best secondary RF in predicting DR compared to 
      'age' and 'BMI,' increasing the predictive power of four primary RFs.

TI  - DR-NASNet: Automated System to Detect and Classify Diabetic Retinopathy Severity 
      Using Improved Pretrained NASNet Model.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13162645 [doi]
LID - 2645
AB  - Diabetes is a widely spread disease that significantly affects people's lives. 
      The leading cause is uncontrolled levels of blood glucose, which develop eye 
      defects over time, including Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), which results in severe 
      visual loss. The primary factor causing blindness is considered to be DR in 
      diabetic patients. DR treatment tries to control the disease's severity, as it is 
      irreversible. The primary goal of this effort is to create a reliable method for 
      automatically detecting the severity of DR. This paper proposes a new automated 
      system (DR-NASNet) to detect and classify DR severity using an improved 
      pretrained NASNet Model. To develop the DR-NASNet system, we first utilized a 
      preprocessing technique that takes advantage of Ben Graham and CLAHE to lessen 
      noise, emphasize lesions, and ultimately improve DR classification performance. 
      Taking into account the imbalance between classes in the dataset, data 
      augmentation procedures were conducted to control overfitting. Next, we have 
      integrated dense blocks into the NASNet architecture to improve the effectiveness 
      of classification results for five severity levels of DR. In practice, the 
      DR-NASNet model achieves state-of-the-art results with a smaller model size and 
      lower complexity. To test the performance of the DR-NASNet system, a combination 
      of various datasets is used in this paper. To learn effective features from DR 
      images, we used a pretrained model on the dataset. The last step is to put the 
      image into one of five categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Proliferate, or Severe. 
      To carry this out, the classifier layer of a linear SVM with a linear activation 
      function must be added. The DR-NASNet system was tested using six different 
      experiments. The system achieves 96.05% accuracy with the challenging DR dataset. 
      The results and comparisons demonstrate that the DR-NASNet system improves a 
      model's performance and learning ability. As a result, the DR-NASNet system 
      provides assistance to ophthalmologists by describing an effective system for 
      classifying early-stage levels of DR.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a validated Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      algorithm developed for a smartphone-based camera on images captured using a 
      standard desktop fundus camera to screen for diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with established diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Images 
      captured on a desktop fundus camera (Topcon TRC-50DX, Japan) for a previous study 
      with 135 consecutive patients (233 eyes) with established diabetes mellitus, with 
      or without DR were analysed by the AI algorithm. The performance of the AI 
      algorithm to detect any DR, referable DR (RDR Ie, worse than mild non 
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and/or diabetic macular edema (DME)) 
      and sight-threatening DR (STDR Ie, severe NPDR or worse and/or DME) were assessed 
      based on comparisons against both image-based consensus grades by two fellowship 
      trained vitreo-retina specialists and clinical examination. RESULTS: The 
      sensitivity was 98.3% (95% CI 96%, 100%) and the specificity 83.7% (95% CI 73%, 
      94%) for RDR against image grading. The specificity for RDR decreased to 65.2% 
      (95% CI 53.7%, 76.6%) and the sensitivity marginally increased to 100% (95% CI 
      100%, 100%) when compared against clinical examination. The sensitivity for 
      detection of any DR when compared against image-based consensus grading and 
      clinical exam were both 97.6% (95% CI 95%, 100%). The specificity for any DR 
      detection was 90.9% (95% CI 82.3%, 99.4%) as compared against image grading and 
      88.9% (95% CI 79.7%, 98.1%) on clinical exam. The sensitivity for STDR was 99.0% 
      (95% CI 96%, 100%) against image grading and 100% (95% CI 100%, 100%) as compared 
      against clinical exam. CONCLUSION: The AI algorithm could screen for RDR and any 
      DR with robust performance on images captured on a desktop fundus camera when 
      compared to image grading, despite being previously optimized for a 
      smartphone-based camera.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major complication in human eyes among the 
      diabetic patients. Early detection of the DR can save many patients from 
      permanent blindness. Various artificial intelligent based systems have been 
      proposed and they outperform human analysis in accurate detection of the DR. In 
      most of the traditional deep learning models, the cross-entropy is used as a 
      common loss function in a single stage end-to-end training method. However, it 
      has been recently identified that this loss function has some limitations such as 
      poor margin leading to false results, sensitive to noisy data and hyperparameter 
      variations. To overcome these issues, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) has 
      been introduced. In this study, SCL method, a two-stage training method with 
      supervised contrastive loss function was proposed for the first time to the best 
      of authors' knowledge to identify the DR and its severity stages from fundus 
      images (FIs) using "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection" dataset. "Messidor-2" dataset 
      was also used to conduct experiments for further validating the model's 
      performance. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was applied 
      for enhancing the image quality and the pre-trained Xception CNN model was 
      deployed as the encoder with transfer learning. To interpret the SCL of the 
      model, t-SNE method was used to visualize the embedding space (unit hyper sphere) 
      composed of 128 D space into a 2 D space. The proposed model achieved a test 
      accuracy of 98.36%, and AUC score of 98.50% to identify the DR (Binary 
      classification) and a test accuracy of 84.364%, and AUC score of 93.819% for five 
      stages grading with the APTOS 2019 dataset. Other evaluation metrics (precision, 
      recall, F1-score) were also determined with APTOS 2019 as well as with Messidor-2 
      for analyzing the performance of the proposed model. It was also concluded that 
      the proposed method achieved better performance in detecting the DR compared to 
      the conventional CNN without SCL and other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Hyper-reflective foci segmentation in SD-OCT retinal images with diabetic 
      retinopathy using deep convolutional neural networks.
PG  - 4502-4519
LID - 10.1002/mp.13728 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to automatically and accurately segment 
      hyper-reflective foci (HRF) in spectral domain optical coherence tomography 
      (SD-OCT) images with diabetic retinopathy (DR) using deep convolutional neural 
      networks. METHODS: An automatic HRF segmentation model for SD-OCT images based on 
      deep networks was constructed. The model segmented small lesions through 
      pixel-wise predictions based on small image patches. We used an approach for 
      discriminative features extraction for small patches by introducing small kernels 
      and strides in convolutional and pooling layers, which was applied on the 
      state-of-the-art deep classification networks (GoogLeNet and ResNet). The 
      features extracted by the adapted deep networks were fed into a softmax layer to 
      produce the probabilities of HRF. We trained different models on a dataset with 
      16 HRF eyes by using different sizes of patches, and then, we fused these models 
      to generate optimal results. RESULTS: Experimental results on 18 eyes 
      demonstrated that our method is effective for the HRF segmentation. The dice 
      similarity coefficient (DSC) for the foci area in B-scan, projection images, and 
      foci amount in B-scan images reaches 67.81%, 74.09%, and 72.45%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed segmentation model can accurately segment HRF in SD-OCT 
      images with DR and outperforms traditional methods. Our model may provide 
      reliable segmentations for small lesions in SD-OCT images and may be helpful in 
      the clinical diagnosis of diseases.

TI  - SMiT: symmetric mask transformer for disease severity detection.
PG  - 16075-16086
LID - 10.1007/s00432-023-05223-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The application of deep learning methods to the intelligent diagnosis of 
      diseases has been the focus of intelligent medical research. When dealing with 
      image classification tasks, if the lesion area is small and uneven, the 
      background image involved in the training will affect the ultimate accuracy in 
      determining the extent of the lesion. We did not follow the traditional approach 
      of building an intelligent system to assist physicians in diagnosis from the 
      perspective of CNN models, but instead proposed a pure transformer framework that 
      can be used for diagnostic grading of pathological images. METHODS: We propose a 
      Symmetric Mask Pre-Training vision Transformer SMiT model for grading 
      pathological cancer images. SMiT performs a symmetrically identical high 
      probability sparsification of the input image token sequence at the first and 
      last encoder layer positions to pre-train visual transformers, and the parameters 
      of the baseline model are fine-tuned after loading the pre-training weights, 
      allowing the model to concentrate more on extracting detailed features in the 
      lesion region, effectively getting rid of the potential feature dependency 
      problem. RESULTS: SMiT achieved 92.8% classification accuracy on 4500 
      histopathological images of colorectal cancer processed by Gaussian filter 
      denoising. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of this study's 
      methodology on the publicly available diabetic retinopathy dataset APTOS2019 from 
      Kaggle and achieved quadratic Cohen Kappa, accuracy and F1-score of 91.9%, 86.91% 
      and 72.85%, respectively, which were 1-2% better than previous studies based on 
      CNN models. CONCLUSION: SMiT uses a simpler strategy to achieve better results to 
      assist physicians in making accurate clinical decisions, which can be an 
      inspiration for making good use of the visual transformers in the field of 
      medical imaging.

TI  - High-fidelity diabetic retina fundus image synthesis from freestyle lesion maps.
PG  - 533-549
LID - 10.1364/BOE.477906 [doi]
AB  - Retina fundus imaging for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an efficient 
      and patient-friendly modality, where many high-resolution images can be easily 
      obtained for accurate diagnosis. With the advancements of deep learning, 
      data-driven models may facilitate the process of high-throughput diagnosis 
      especially in areas with less availability of certified human experts. Many 
      datasets of DR already exist for training learning-based models. However, most 
      are often unbalanced, do not have a large enough sample count, or both. This 
      paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for generating photo-realistic retinal fundus 
      images based on either artificially generated or free-hand drawn semantic lesion 
      maps. The first stage uses a conditional StyleGAN to generate synthetic lesion 
      maps based on a DR severity grade. The second stage then uses GauGAN to convert 
      the synthetic lesion maps into high resolution fundus images. We evaluate the 
      photo-realism of generated images using the Fréchet inception distance (FID), and 
      show the efficacy of our pipeline through downstream tasks, such as; dataset 
      augmentation for automatic DR grading and lesion segmentation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most serious complications of 
      diabetes. Early detection and treatment of DR are key public health interventions 
      that can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. How to effectively screen 
      and diagnose the retinal fundus image in order to identify retinopathy in time is 
      a major challenge. In the traditional DR screening system, the accuracy of 
      micro-aneurysm (MA) and hemorrhagic (H) lesion detection determines the final 
      screening performance. The detection method produced a large number of false 
      positive samples for guaranteeing high sensitivity, and the classification model 
      was not effective in removing false positives since the suspicious lesions lack 
      label information. METHODS: In order to solve the problem of supervised learning 
      in the diagnosis of DR, we formulate weakly supervised multi-class DR grading as 
      a multi-class multi-instance problem where each image (bag) is labeled as healthy 
      or abnormal and consists of unlabeled candidate lesion regions (instances). 
      Specifically, we proposed a multi-kernel multi-instance learning method based on 
      graph kernel. Moreover, we develop an under-sampling from instance level and 
      over-sampling from bag level to improve the performance of the multi-instance 
      learning in the diagnosis of DR. RESULTS: Through empirical evaluation and 
      comparison with different baselinemethods and the state-of-the-art methods on 
      data from Messidor, we illustrate that the proposed method reports favorable 
      results, with an overall classification accuracy of 0.916 and an AUC of 0.957. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The experiments results demonstrate that the proposed multi-kernel 
      multi-instance learning framework with bi-level re-sampling can solve the problem 
      in the imbalanced and weakly supervised data for grading diabetic retinopathy, 
      and it improves the diagnosis performance over several state-of-the-art competing 
      methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm for detecting 
      referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) based on color fundus photographs. 
      DESIGN: A deep learning system for the classification of GON was developed for 
      automated classification of GON on color fundus photographs. PARTICIPANTS: We 
      retrospectively included 48 116 fundus photographs for the development and 
      validation of a deep learning algorithm. METHODS: This study recruited 21 trained 
      ophthalmologists to classify the photographs. Referable GON was defined as 
      vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more and other typical changes of GON. The 
      reference standard was made until 3 graders achieved agreement. A separate 
      validation dataset of 8000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess 
      the performance of this algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under receiver 
      operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity was applied 
      to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning algorithm detecting referable GON. 
      RESULTS: In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 
      0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 92.0%. The most common reasons 
      for false-negative grading (n = 87) were GON with coexisting eye conditions (n = 
      44 [50.6%]), including pathologic or high myopia (n = 37 [42.6%]), diabetic 
      retinopathy (n = 4 [4.6%]), and age-related macular degeneration (n = 3 [3.4%]). 
      The leading reason for false-positive results (n = 480) was having other eye 
      conditions (n = 458 [95.4%]), mainly including physiologic cupping (n = 267 
      [55.6%]). Misclassification as false-positive results amidst a normal-appearing 
      fundus occurred in only 22 eyes (4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning system can 
      detect referable GON with high sensitivity and specificity. Coexistence of high 
      or pathologic myopia is the most common cause resulting in false-negative 
      results. Physiologic cupping and pathologic myopia were the most common reasons 
      for false-positive results.

      for Detecting Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy from Fundus Photographs.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10111266 [doi]
LID - 1266
AB  - Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) can be diagnosed and monitored using fundus 
      photography, a widely available and low-cost approach already adopted for 
      automated screening of ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Despite 
      this, the lack of validated early screening approaches remains a major obstacle 
      in the prevention of glaucoma-related blindness. Deep learning models have gained 
      significant interest as potential solutions, as these models offer objective and 
      high-throughput methods for processing image-based medical data. While 
      convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely utilized for these purposes, 
      more recent advances in the application of Transformer architectures have led to 
      new models, including Vision Transformer (ViT,) that have shown promise in many 
      domains of image analysis. However, previous comparisons of these two 
      architectures have not sufficiently compared models side-by-side with more than a 
      single dataset, making it unclear which model is more generalizable or performs 
      better in different clinical contexts. Our purpose is to investigate comparable 
      ViT and CNN models tasked with GON detection from fundus photos and highlight 
      their respective strengths and weaknesses. We train CNN and ViT models on six 
      unrelated, publicly available databases and compare their performance using 
      well-established statistics including AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Our 
      results indicate that ViT models often show superior performance when compared 
      with a similarly trained CNN model, particularly when non-glaucomatous images are 
      over-represented in a given dataset. We discuss the clinical implications of 
      these findings and suggest that ViT can further the development of accurate and 
      scalable GON detection for this leading cause of irreversible blindness 
      worldwide.

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Using Smartphone-Based Fundus Photography and 
      Deep-Learning Artificial Intelligence in the Yucatan Peninsula: A Field Study.
PG  - 19322968231194644
LID - 10.1177/19322968231194644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the performance of Medios (offline) and EyeArt (online) 
      artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      on images captured using fundus-on-smartphone photography in a remote outreach 
      field setting. METHODS: In June, 2019 in the Yucatan Peninsula, 248 patients, 
      many of whom had chronic visual impairment, were screened for DR using two 
      portable Remidio fundus-on-phone cameras, and 2130 images obtained were analyzed, 
      retrospectively, by Medios and EyeArt. Screening performance metrics also were 
      determined retrospectively using masked image analysis combined with clinical 
      examination results as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients 
      were determined to have some level of DR; 119 patients had no DR. Medios was 
      capable of evaluating every patient with a sensitivity (95% confidence intervals 
      [CIs]) of 94% (88%-97%) and specificity of 94% (88%-98%). Owing primarily to 
      photographer error, EyeArt evaluated 156 patients with a sensitivity of 94% 
      (86%-98%) and specificity of 86% (77%-93%). In a head-to-head comparison of 110 
      patients, the sensitivities of Medios and EyeArt were 99% (93%-100%) and 95% 
      (87%-99%). The specificities for both were 88% (73%-97%). CONCLUSIONS: Medios and 
      EyeArt AI algorithms demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity for 
      detecting DR when applied in this real-world field setting. Both programs should 
      be considered in remote, large-scale DR screening campaigns where immediate 
      results are desirable, and in the case of EyeArt, online access is possible.

TI  - Supervised Machine Learning Based Multi-Task Artificial Intelligence 
      Classification of Retinopathies.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8060872 [doi]
LID - 872
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) classification holds promise as a novel and 
      affordable screening tool for clinical management of ocular diseases. Rural and 
      underserved areas, which suffer from lack of access to experienced 
      ophthalmologists may particularly benefit from this technology. Quantitative 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging provides excellent 
      capability to identify subtle vascular distortions, which are useful for 
      classifying retinovascular diseases. However, application of AI for 
      differentiation and classification of multiple eye diseases is not yet 
      established. In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based 
      multi-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from 
      diseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease 
      conditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular 
      condition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), 
      blood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel density 
      (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour irregularity 
      (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images. A stepwise 
      backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive OCTA features 
      and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task classification. For 
      proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sickle cell 
      retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine leaning 
      classifier. The presented AI classification methodology is applicable and can be 
      readily extended to other ocular diseases, holding promise to enable a 
      mass-screening platform for clinical deployment and telemedicine.

TI  - A Weakly Supervised Deep Learning Approach for Leakage Detection in Fluorescein 
      Angiography Images.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to design an automated algorithm that can 
      detect fluorescence leakage accurately and quickly without the use of a large 
      amount of labeled data. METHODS: A weakly supervised learning-based method was 
      proposed to detect fluorescein leakage without the need for manual annotation of 
      leakage areas. To enhance the representation of the network, a residual attention 
      module (RAM) was designed as the core component of the proposed generator. 
      Moreover, class activation maps (CAMs) were used to define a novel anomaly mask 
      loss to facilitate more accurate learning of leakage areas. In addition, 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and dice 
      coefficient (DC) were used to evaluate the performance of the methods. RESULTS: 
      The proposed method reached a sensitivity of 0.73 ± 0.04, a specificity of 0.97 ± 
      0.03, an accuracy of 0.95 ± 0.05, an AUC of 0.86 ± 0.04, and a DC of 0.87 ± 0.01 
      on the HRA data set; a sensitivity of 0.91 ± 0.02, a specificity of 0.97 ± 0.02, 
      an accuracy of 0.96 ± 0.03, an AUC of 0.94 ± 0.02, and a DC of 0.85 ± 0.03 on 
      Zhao's publicly available data set; and a sensitivity of 0.71 ± 0.04, a 
      specificity of 0.99 ± 0.06, an accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.06, an AUC of 0.85 ± 0.02, 
      and a DC of 0.78 ± 0.04 on Rabbani's publicly available data set. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves better 
      performance on fluorescence leakage detection and can detect one image within 1 
      second and thus has great potential value for clinical diagnosis and treatment of 
      retina-related diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and malarial retinopathy. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The proposed weakly supervised learning-based method 
      that automates the detection of fluorescence leakage can facilitate the 
      assessment of retinal-related diseases.

LID - 816
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), and 
      it is necessary to diagnose DR in the early stages of treatment. With the rapid 
      development of convolutional neural networks in the field of image processing, 
      deep learning methods have achieved great success in the field of medical image 
      processing. Various medical lesion detection systems have been proposed to detect 
      fundus lesions. At present, in the image classification process of diabetic 
      retinopathy, the fine-grained properties of the diseased image are ignored and 
      most of the retinopathy image data sets have serious uneven distribution 
      problems, which limits the ability of the network to predict the classification 
      of lesions to a large extent. We propose a new non-homologous bilinear pooling 
      convolutional neural network model and combine it with the attention mechanism to 
      further improve the network's ability to extract specific features of the image. 
      The experimental results show that, compared with the most popular fundus image 
      classification models, the network model we proposed can greatly improve the 
      prediction accuracy of the network while maintaining computational efficiency.

PG  - 852-856
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-318252 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the associations between body mass index (BMI) with 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR). 
      METHODS: This was a longitudinal study which included DM-free participants aged 
      ≥40 years from the Lingtou Eye Cohort Study at baseline (2008-2010). Physical and 
      ocular examinations were performed at baseline and annual follow-ups under 
      standardised protocol. Two 45° non-mydriatic colour digital retinal photographs 
      were obtained for each eye at all study visits, and presence of VTDR at the 2016 
      follow-up was graded by a deep-learning algorithm (LableMe) with proved high 
      accuracy for detection of VTDR. RESULTS: A total of 2934 participants were 
      included with a mean (SD) age of 59.5 (7.3) years (58.3% men). Participants with 
      incident DM (441/2934, 15%) were significantly older (p<0.001), had higher 
      obesity levels (p<0.001), higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001), 
      diastolic blood pressure (p<0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p<0.001), 
      triglycerides (p=0.002) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.001), as 
      compared with those without. Participants with incident VTDR (48/2934, 1.63%) 
      were also older (p<0.001), had higher SBP (p=0.013) and FPG (p<0.001), but did 
      not differ in baseline BMI, comparing with those without. Regression analysis 
      showed that higher baseline BMI was significantly related to incident DM 
      (p<0.005), but not incident VTDR, during the follow-up. Subgroup analysis among 
      participants with incident DM also revealed no association between BMI and VTDR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline BMI increased the risk of incident DM, but was not 
      related to the risk of VTDR in this adult Chinese population.

TI  - Five-Year Cost-Effectiveness Modeling of Primary Care-Based, Nonmydriatic 
      Automated Retinal Image Analysis Screening Among Low-Income Patients With 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 415-427
LID - 10.1177/1932296820967011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence-based technology systems offer an alternative 
      solution for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening compared with standard, 
      in-office dilated eye examinations. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
      Automated Retinal Image Analysis System (ARIAS)-based DR screening in a primary 
      care medicine clinic that serves a low-income patient population. METHODS: A 
      model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of two DR screening systems was created 
      utilizing data from a recent study comparing adherence rates to follow-up eye 
      care among adults ages 18 or older with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In the 
      study, the patients were prescreened with an ARIAS-based, nonmydriatic 
      (undilated), point-of-care tool in the primary care setting and were compared 
      with patients with diabetes who were referred for dilated retinal screening 
      without prescreening, as is the current standard of care. Using a Markov model 
      with microsimulation resulting in a total of 600 000 simulated patient 
      experiences, we calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two 
      screening approaches, with regard to five-year cost-effectiveness of DR screening 
      and treatment of vision-threatening DR. RESULTS: At five years, ARIAS-based 
      screening showed similar utility as the standard of care screening systems. 
      However, ARIAS reduced costs by 23.3%, with an ICUR of $258 721.81 comparing the 
      current practice to ARIAS. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care-based ARIAS DR screening is 
      cost-effective when compared with standard of care screening methods.

TI  - Retinal age gap as a predictive biomarker for future risk of clinically 
      significant diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 373-380
LID - 10.1007/s00592-023-02199-5 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Retinal age derived from fundus images has been verified as a novel ageing 
      biomarker. We aim to explore the association between retinal age gap (retinal age 
      minus chronological age) and incident diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Retinal 
      age prediction was performed by a deep learning model, trained and validated 
      based on 19,200 fundus images of 11,052 disease-free participants. Retinal age 
      gaps were determined for 2311 patients with diabetes who had no history of 
      diabetic retinopathy at baseline. DR events were ascertained by data linkage to 
      hospital admissions. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to 
      evaluate the association between retinal age gaps and incident DR. RESULTS: 
      During the median follow-up period of 11.0 (interquartile range: 10.8-11.1) 
      years, 183 of 2311 participants with diabetes developed incident DR. Each 
      additional year of the retinal age gap was associated with a 7% increase in the 
      risk of incident DR (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.02-1.12, P = 0.004), after adjusting for confounding factors. Participants with 
      retinal age gaps in the fourth quartile had a significantly higher DR risk 
      compared to participants with retinal age gaps in the lowest quartile (HR = 2.88, 
      95% CI 1.61-5.15, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher retinal age gap 
      was associated with an increased risk of incident DR. As an easy and non-invasive 
      biomarker, the retinal age gap may serve as an informative tool to facilitate the 
      individualized risk assessment and personalized screening protocol for DR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) causes irreversible visual impairment in 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Immunity played a crucial role in DR. 
      Nevertheless, the triggering mechanism of DR was not yet thorough enough. Herein, 
      we aim to identify the immune-associated genes as biomarkers associated with 
      immune scores that can distinguish early DR from DM without DR. METHODS: In this 
      study, total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 15 
      non-proliferative DR patients and 15 DM patients without DR were collected and 
      the transcriptome sequencing data were extracted. Firstly, the target genes were 
      obtained by intersecting the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were 
      screened by "limma", and the module genes (related to immune scores), which were 
      screened by "WGCNA". In order to screen for the crucial genes, three machine 
      learning algorithms were implemented, and a receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curve was used to obtain the diagnostic genes. Moreover, the gene set 
      enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to understand the function of diagnostic 
      genes, and analysis of the proportions of immune cells and their association with 
      diagnostic genes was performed to analyze the pathogenesis of DR. Furthermore, 
      the regulatory network of TF-mRNA-miRNA was built to reveal the possible 
      regulation of diagnostic genes. Finally, the quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the mRNA level of diagnostic 
      genes. RESULTS: A total of three immune-associated diagnostic genes, namely, 
      FAM209B, POM121L1P, and PTGES, were obtained, and their expression was increased 
      in PBMC samples of DR, and qRT-PCR results confirmed these results. Moreover, the 
      functions of these genes were associated with immune response. The expression of 
      POM121L1P and PTGES was significantly negatively associated with naive B cells, 
      and the expression of FAM209B was significantly negatively associated with 
      immature dendritic cells. Moreover, ESR1 could regulate both FAM209B and PTGES. 
      CONCLUSION: This study identified three immune-associated diagnostic genes, 
      FAM209B, POM121L1P, and PTGES, as biomarkers associated with immune scores in DR 
      for the first time. This finding might proffer a novel perspective of the 
      triggering mechanism of DR, and help to understand the role of immune-associated 
      genes in the molecular mechanism of DR more deeply.

AB  - (Background and Objective): The occurrence of hard exudates is one of the early 
      signs of diabetic retinopathy which is one of the leading causes of the 
      blindness. Many patients with diabetic retinopathy lose their vision because of 
      the late detection of the disease. Thus, this paper is to propose a novel method 
      of hard exudates segmentation in retinal images in an automatic way. (Methods): 
      The existing methods are based on either supervised or unsupervised learning 
      techniques. In addition, the learned segmentation models may often cause 
      miss-detection and/or fault-detection of hard exudates, due to the lack of rich 
      characteristics, the intra-variations, and the similarity with other components 
      in the retinal image. Thus, in this paper, the supervised learning based on the 
      multilayer perceptron (MLP) is only used to identify initial seeds with high 
      confidences to be hard exudates. Then, the segmentation is finalized by 
      unsupervised learning based on the iterative graph cut (GC) using clusters of 
      initial seeds. Also, in order to reduce color intra-variations of hard exudates 
      in different retinal images, the color transfer (CT) is applied to normalize 
      their color information, in the pre-processing step. (Results): The experiments 
      and comparisons with the other existing methods are based on the two well-known 
      datasets, e_ophtha EX and DIARETDB1. It can be seen that the proposed method 
      outperforms the other existing methods in the literature, with the sensitivity in 
      the pixel-level of 0.891 for the DIARETDB1 dataset and 0.564 for the e_ophtha EX 
      dataset. The cross datasets validation where the training process is performed on 
      one dataset and the testing process is performed on another dataset is also 
      evaluated in this paper, in order to illustrate the robustness of the proposed 
      method. (Conclusions): This newly proposed method integrates the supervised 
      learning and unsupervised learning based techniques. It achieves the improved 
      performance, when compared with the existing methods in the literature. The 
      robustness of the proposed method for the scenario of cross datasets could 
      enhance its practical usage. That is, the trained model could be more practical 
      for unseen data in the real-world situation, especially when the capturing 
      environments of training and testing images are not the same.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the choroidal vasculature and their 
      correlations with visual acuity in diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: The cohort 
      was composed of 225 eyes from 225 subjects, including 60 eyes from 60 subjects 
      with healthy control, 55 eyes from 55 subjects without DR, 46 eyes from 46 
      subjects with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 21 eyes from 21 
      subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and 43 eyes from 43 
      subjects with clinically significant macular edema (CSME). Swept-source optical 
      coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was used to image the eyes with a 12-mm radial line 
      scan protocol. The parameters for 6-mm diameters of region centered on the 
      macular fovea were analyzed. Initially, a custom deep learning algorithm based on 
      a modified residual U-Net architecture was utilized for choroidal boundary 
      segmentation. Subsequently, the SS-OCT image was binarized and the Niblack-based 
      automatic local threshold algorithm was employed to calibrate subfoveal choroidal 
      thickness (SFCT), luminal area (LA), and stromal area (SA) by determining the 
      distance between the two boundaries. Finally, the ratio of LA and total choroidal 
      area (SA + LA) was defined as the choroidal vascularity index (CVI). The 
      choroidal parameters in five groups were compared, and correlations of the 
      choroidal parameters with age, gender, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), 
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar, SFCT and best-corrected visual 
      acuity (BCVA) were analyzed. RESULTS: The CVI, SFCT, LA, and SA values of 
      patients with DR were found to be significantly lower compared to both healthy 
      patients and patients without DR (P < 0.05). The SFCT was significantly higher in 
      NPDR group compared to the No DR group (P < 0.001). Additionally, the SFCT was 
      lower in the PDR group compared to the NPDR group (P = 0.014). Furthermore, there 
      was a gradual decrease in CVI with progression of diabetic retinopathy, reaching 
      its lowest value in the PDR group. However, the CVI of the CSME group exhibited a 
      marginally closer proximity to that of the NPDR group. The multivariate 
      regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between CVI and the duration 
      of DM as well as LA (P < 0.05). The results of both univariate and multivariate 
      regression analyses demonstrated a significant positive correlation between CVI 
      and BCVA (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Choroidal vascular alterations, especially 
      decreased CVI, occurred in patients with DR. The CVI decreased with duration of 
      DM and was correlated with visual impairment, indicating that the CVI might be a 
      reliable imaging biomarker to monitor the progression of DR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition that can lead to a 
      variety of consequences. Diabetes is a condition that is caused by factors such 
      as age, lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, high 
      blood pressure, depression and stress, poor food, and so on. Diabetics are at a 
      higher risk of developing diseases such as heart disease, nerve damage (diabetic 
      neuropathy), eye problems (diabetic retinopathy), kidney disease (diabetic 
      nephropathy), stroke, and so on. According to the International Diabetes 
      Federation, 382 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. By 2035, this 
      number will have risen to 592 million. Every day, a large number of people become 
      victims, and many are ignorant whether they have it or not. It primarily affects 
      individuals between the ages of 25 and 74 years. If diabetes is left untreated 
      and undiagnosed, it can lead to a slew of complications. The emergence of machine 
      learning approaches, on the other hand, solves this crucial issue. AIMS AND 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study the DM and analyze how machine learning 
      algorithms are used to identify the diabetes mellitus at an early stage, which is 
      one of the most serious metabolic disorders in the world today. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Data was obtained from databases such as Pubmed, IEEE xplore, and 
      INSPEC,and from other secondary sources and primary sources in which methods 
      based on machine learning approaches used in healthcare to predict diabetes at an 
      early stage are reported. RESULTS: After surveying various research papers, it 
      was found that machine learning classification algorithms like Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) etc shows the 
      best accuracy for predicting diabetes at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Early 
      detection of diabetes is critical for effective therapy. Many people have no idea 
      whether or not they have it. The full assessment of Machine learning approaches 
      for early diabetes prediction and how to apply a variety of supervised and 
      unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the dataset to achieve the best 
      accuracy are addressed in this paper.. Furthermore, the work will be expanded and 
      refined to create a more precise and general predictive model for diabetes risk 
      prediction at an early stage. Different metrics can be used to assess performance 
      and for accurate diabetic diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many publications in diabetic retinopathy (DR) have been 
      reported, there is no bibliometric analysis. PURPOSE: To perform a bibliometric 
      analysis in the field of diabetic retinopathy (DR) research, to characterize the 
      current international status of DR research, to identify the most effective 
      factors involved in this field, and to explore research hotspots in DR research. 
      METHODS: Based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), a bibliometric 
      analysis was conducted to investigate the publication trends in research related 
      to DR. Knowledge maps were constructed by VOSviewer v.1.6.10 to visualize the 
      publications, the distribution of countries, international collaborations, author 
      productivity, source journals, cited references and keywords, and research 
      hotspots in this field. RESULTS: In total, 11,839 peer-reviewed papers were 
      retrieved on DR from 2010 to 2019, and the annual research output increased with 
      time. The United States ranks highest among countries with the most publications. 
      The most active institution is the University of Melbourne. Wong, TY contributed 
      the largest number of publications in this field. Investigative Ophthalmology & 
      Visual Science was the most prolific journal in DR research. The top-cited 
      references mainly investigated the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) medications in the management of DR, and the keywords formed 6 clusters: 
      1. pathogenesis of DR; 2. epidemiology and risk factors for DR; 3. treatments for 
      DR; 4. screening of DR; 5. histopathology of DR; and 6. diagnostic methods for 
      DR. DISCUSSION: With the improvement of living standard, DR has gradually become 
      one of the important causes of blindness, and has become a hot spot of public 
      health research in many countries. The application of deep learning and 
      artificial intelligence in diabetes screening and anti-VEGF medications in the 
      management of DR have been the research hotspots in recent 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on data extracted from the WoSCC, this study provides a broad view of the 
      current status and trends in DR research and may provide clinicians and 
      researchers with insight into DR research and valuable information to identify 
      potential collaborators and partner institutions and better predict their dynamic 
      directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in 
      people with diabetes. Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in interpreting 
      fundus photography (FP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images allows 
      prompt detection and intervention. PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of AI in 
      detecting DME from FP or OCT images and identify potential factors affecting 
      model performances. DATA SOURCES: We searched seven electronic libraries up to 12 
      February 2023. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies using AI to detect DME from 
      FP or OCT images. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted study characteristics and 
      performance parameters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifty-three studies were included in the 
      meta-analysis. FP-based algorithms of 25 studies yielded pooled area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of 
      0.964, 92.6%, and 91.1%, respectively. OCT-based algorithms of 28 studies yielded 
      pooled AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.985, 95.9%, and 97.9%, 
      respectively. Potential factors improving model performance included deep 
      learning techniques, larger size, and more diversity in training data sets. 
      Models demonstrated better performance when validated internally than externally, 
      and those trained with multiple data sets showed better results upon external 
      validation. LIMITATIONS: Analyses were limited by unstandardized algorithm 
      outcomes and insufficient data in patient demographics, OCT volumetric scans, and 
      external validation. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates satisfactory 
      performance of AI in detecting DME from FP or OCT images. External validation is 
      warranted for future studies to evaluate model generalizability. Further 
      investigations may estimate optimal sample size, effect of class balance, patient 
      demographics, and additional benefits of OCT volumetric scans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss in 
      patients with diabetes. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an OCT-omics 
      prediction model for assessing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      treatment response in patients with DME. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 113 
      eyes from 82 patients with DME was conducted. Comprehensive feature engineering 
      was applied to clinical and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. Logistic 
      regression, support vector machine (SVM), and backpropagation neural network 
      (BPNN) classifiers were trained using a training set of 79 eyes, and evaluated on 
      a test set of 34 eyes. Clinical implications of the OCT-omics prediction model 
      were assessed by decision curve analysis. Performance metrics (sensitivity, 
      specificity, F1 score, and AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: The logistic, SVM, and 
      BPNN classifiers demonstrated robust discriminative abilities in both the 
      training and test sets. In the training set, the logistic classifier achieved a 
      sensitivity of 0.904, specificity of 0.741, F1 score of 0.887, and AUC of 0.910. 
      The SVM classifier showed a sensitivity of 0.923, specificity of 0.667, F1 score 
      of 0.881, and AUC of 0.897. The BPNN classifier exhibited a sensitivity of 0.962, 
      specificity of 0.926, F1 score of 0.962, and AUC of 0.982. Similar discriminative 
      capabilities were maintained in the test set. The OCT-omics scores were 
      significantly higher in the non-persistent DME group than in the persistent DME 
      group (p < 0.001). OCT-omics scores were also positively correlated with the rate 
      of decline in central subfield thickness after treatment (Pearson's R = 0.44, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The developed OCT-omics model accurately assesses 
      anti-VEGF treatment response in DME patients. The model's robust performance and 
      clinical implications highlight its utility as a non-invasive tool for 
      personalized treatment prediction and retinal pathology assessment.

AB  - The management of retinal diseases relies heavily on digital imaging data, 
      including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA). 
      Targeted feature extraction and the objective quantification of features provide 
      important opportunities in biomarker discovery, disease burden assessment, and 
      predicting treatment response. Additional important advantages include increased 
      objectivity in interpretation, longitudinal tracking, and ability to incorporate 
      computational models to create automated diagnostic and clinical decision support 
      systems. Advances in computational technology, including deep learning and 
      radiomics, open new doors for developing an imaging phenotype that may provide 
      in-depth personalized disease characterization and enhance opportunities in 
      precision medicine. In this review, we summarize current quantitative and 
      radiomic imaging biomarkers described in the literature for age-related macular 
      degeneration and diabetic eye disease using imaging modalities such as OCT, FA, 
      and OCT angiography (OCTA). Various approaches used to identify and extract these 
      biomarkers that utilize artificial intelligence and deep learning are also 
      summarized in this review. These quantifiable biomarkers and automated approaches 
      have unleashed new frontiers of personalized medicine where treatments are 
      tailored, based on patient-specific longitudinally trackable biomarkers, and 
      response monitoring can be achieved with a high degree of accuracy.

AB  - This review presents and discusses the contribution of machine learning 
      techniques for diagnosis and disease monitoring in the context of clinical vision 
      science. Many ocular diseases leading to blindness can be halted or delayed when 
      detected and treated at its earliest stages. With the recent developments in 
      diagnostic devices, imaging and genomics, new sources of data for early disease 
      detection and patients' management are now available. Machine learning techniques 
      emerged in the biomedical sciences as clinical decision-support techniques to 
      improve sensitivity and specificity of disease detection and monitoring, 
      increasing objectively the clinical decision-making process. This manuscript 
      presents a review in multimodal ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring based on 
      machine learning approaches. In the first section, the technical issues related 
      to the different machine learning approaches will be present. Machine learning 
      techniques are used to automatically recognize complex patterns in a given 
      dataset. These techniques allows creating homogeneous groups (unsupervised 
      learning), or creating a classifier predicting group membership of new cases 
      (supervised learning), when a group label is available for each case. To ensure a 
      good performance of the machine learning techniques in a given dataset, all 
      possible sources of bias should be removed or minimized. For that, the 
      representativeness of the input dataset for the true population should be 
      confirmed, the noise should be removed, the missing data should be treated and 
      the data dimensionally (i.e., the number of parameters/features and the number of 
      cases in the dataset) should be adjusted. The application of machine learning 
      techniques in ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring will be presented and 
      discussed in the second section of this manuscript. To show the clinical benefits 
      of machine learning in clinical vision sciences, several examples will be 
      presented in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic 
      retinopathy, these ocular pathologies being the major causes of irreversible 
      visual impairment.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common comorbidities of diabetes. 
      Unfortunately, the recommended annual screening of the eye fundus of diabetic 
      patients is too resource-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools 
      that may help doctors to determine the risk of each patient to attain this 
      condition, so that patients with a low risk may be screened less frequently and 
      the use of resources can be improved. This paper explores the use of two kinds of 
      ensemble classifiers learned from data: fuzzy random forest and dominance-based 
      rough set balanced rule ensemble. These classifiers use a small set of attributes 
      which represent main risk factors to determine whether a patient is in risk of 
      developing diabetic retinopathy. The levels of specificity and sensitivity 
      obtained in the presented study are over 80%. This study is thus a first 
      successful step towards the construction of a personalized decision support 
      system that could help physicians in daily clinical practice.

AB  - A metabolic disease known as diabetes mellitus (DM) is primarily brought on by an 
      increase in blood sugar levels. On the other hand, DM and the complications it 
      causes, such as diabetic Retinopathy (DR), will quickly emerge as one of the 
      major health challenges of the twenty-first century. This indicates a huge 
      economic burden on health-related authorities and governments. The detection of 
      DM in the earlier stage can lead to early diagnosis and a considerable drop in 
      mortality. Therefore, in order to detect DM at an early stage, an efficient 
      detection system having the ability to detect DM is required. An effective 
      classification method, named Exponential Anti Corona Virus Optimization (ExpACVO) 
      is devised in this research work for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) detection using 
      tongue images. Here, the UNet-Conditional Random Field-Recurrent Neural Network 
      (UNet-CRF-RNN) is used to segment the images, and the proposed ExpACVO algorithm 
      is used to train the UNet-CRF-RNN. Deep Q Network (DQN) classifier is used for DM 
      detection, and the proposed ExpACVO is used for DQN training. The proposed 
      ExpACVO algorithm is a newly created formula that combines Anti Corona Virus 
      Optimization(ACVO) with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). With maximum 
      testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 0.932, 0.950, and 0.914, 
      respectively, the developed technique thus achieved improved performance.

      referable diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, pathologic myopia, 
      retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, 
      vitreous opacity, and optic neuropathy. The model was tested on three test sets 
      with data volumes of 465, 979, and 525. The performance of the three deep 
      learning networks, EfficientNet-B7, DenseNet, and ResNet-101, was evaluated on 
      the internal test set. Additionally, we compared the performance of the deep 
      learning model with that of doctors in a tertiary referral hospital. RESULTS: 
      Compared to the other two deep learning models, EfficientNet-B7 achieved the best 
      performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the 
      EfficientNet-B7 model on the internal test set, external test set A and external 
      test set B were 0.9708 (0.8772, 0.9849) to 1.0000 (1.0000, 1.0000), 0.9683 
      (0.8829, 0.9770) to 1.0000 (0.9975, 1.0000), and 0.8919 (0.7150, 0.9055) to 
      0.9977 (0.9165, 1.0000), respectively. On a data set of 100 images, the total 
      accuracy of the deep learning model was 93.00%, the average accuracy of three 
      ophthalmologists who had been working for 2 years and three ophthalmologists who 
      had been working in fundus imaging for more than 5 years was 88.00% and 94.00%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: High performance was achieved on all three test sets 
      using our UWFI multidisease classification model with a small sample size and 
      fast model inference. The performance of the artificial intelligence model was 
      comparable to that of a physician with 2-5 years of experience in fundus diseases 
      at a tertiary referral hospital. The model is expected to be used as an effective 
      aid for fundus disease screening.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the relationships of region-specific properties of 
      ultra-widefield fluorescence angiography (UWFFA) images with two adverse 
      outcomes, diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
      (PDR), and also the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods: A 
      cross-sectional observational study was performed to retrospectively analyze 
      UWFFA images of patients with DR. All patients underwent UWFFA and optical 
      coherence tomography examination. Leakage index and microaneurysm (MA) count were 
      measured using Trainable Weka Segmentation, a machine learning algorithm, and 
      ischemic index (ISI) was measured manually. The correlation between UWFFA 
      parameters and severity of DR was analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic 
      curves were used to estimate their diagnostic value for DME and PDR. Results: A 
      total of 108 eyes from 108 patients with DR (mean age of 56.04 ± 8.85 years) were 
      analyzed. As the severity of DR increased, the ISI and leakage index of the 
      panretina and all subregions increased. Panretinal MA count and leakage index 
      were significantly higher in eyes with DME than those without DME (p = 0.044 and 
      0.001, respectively). Leakage index and ISI were significantly higher in eyes 
      with PDR than those without PDR in both panretinal and subregion-specific 
      measurements (all p < 0.05). Throughout the retina and specifically in the 
      posterior area (PoA), the leakage index had a higher diagnostic value for DME 
      than ISI or MA count (all p < 0.05). The diagnostic value of MA count for PDR was 
      lower than that of ISI and leakage index (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: The ISI, 
      leakage index, and MA count in the PoA and panretina correlated with the severity 
      of DR, especially the posterior parameter. The leakage index was more valuable 
      than ISI and MA count in determining the occurrence of DME. ISI and leakage index 
      were better predictors of PDR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Portable retinal cameras and deep learning (DL) algorithms are novel 
      tools adopted by diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs. Our objective is 
      to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a DL algorithm and the performance of 
      portable handheld retinal cameras in the detection of DR in a large and 
      heterogenous type 2 diabetes population in a real-world, high burden setting. 
      METHOD: Participants underwent fundus photographs of both eyes with a portable 
      retinal camera (Phelcom Eyer). Classification of DR was performed by human 
      reading and a DL algorithm (PhelcomNet), consisting of a convolutional neural 
      network trained on a dataset of fundus images captured exclusively with the 
      portable device; both methods were compared. We calculated the area under the 
      curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for more than mild DR. RESULTS: A total 
      of 824 individuals with type 2 diabetes were enrolled at Itabuna Diabetes 
      Campaign, a subset of 679 (82.4%) of whom could be fully assessed. The algorithm 
      sensitivity/specificity was 97.8 % (95% CI 96.7-98.9)/61.4 % (95% CI 57.7-65.1); 
      AUC was 0·89. All false negative cases were classified as moderate 
      non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) by human grading. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      DL algorithm reached a good diagnostic accuracy for more than mild DR in a 
      real-world, high burden setting. The performance of the handheld portable retinal 
      camera was adequate, with over 80% of individuals presenting with images of 
      sufficient quality. Portable devices and artificial intelligence tools may 
      increase coverage of DR screening programs.

      Retinal Photographs and Accuracy of Automated Image Analysis.
PG  - 286-295
LID - 10.1080/09286586.2021.1939886 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for diabetic eye disease (DED) and general diabetes care is 
      often separate, which leads to delays and low adherence to DED screening 
      recommendations. Thus, we assessed the feasibility, achieved image quality, and 
      possible barriers of telemedical DED screening in a point-of-care general 
      practice setting and the accuracy of an automated algorithm for detection of DED. 
      METHODS: Patients with diabetes were recruited at general practices. Retinal 
      images were acquired using a non-mydriatic camera (CenterVue, Italy) by medical 
      assistants. Images were quality assessed and double graded by two graders. All 
      images were also graded automatically using a commercially available artificial 
      intelligence (AI) algorithm (EyeArt version 2.1.0, Eyenuk Inc.). RESULTS: A total 
      of 75 patients (147 eyes; mean age 69 years, 96% type 2 diabetes) were included. 
      Most of the patients (51; 68%) preferred DED screening at the general practice, 
      but only twenty-four (32%) were willing to pay for this service. Images of 63 
      patients (84%) were determined to be evaluable, and DED was diagnosed in 6 
      patients (8.0%). The algorithm's positive/negative predictive values (95% 
      confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.28-0.99)/1.00 (0.92-1.00) and 0.75 
      (0.19-0.99)/0.98 (0.88-1.00) for detection of any DED and referral-warranted DED, 
      respectively.Overall, the number of referrals was 18 (24%) for manual telemedical 
      assessment and 31 (41%) for the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, resulting 
      in a relative increase of referrals by 72% when using AI. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      shows that achieved overall image quality in a telemedical GP-based DED screening 
      was sufficient and that it would be accepted by medical assistants and patients 
      in most cases. However, good image quality and integration into existing workflow 
      remain challenging. Based on these findings, a larger-scale implementation study 
      is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the ability of an autonomous artificial 
      intelligence (AI) system for detection of the most common central retinal 
      pathologies in fundus photography. METHODS: Retrospective diagnostic test 
      evaluation on a raw dataset of 5918 images (2839 individuals) evaluated with 
      non-mydriatic cameras during routine occupational health checkups. Three camera 
      models were employed: Optomed Aurora (field of view - FOV 50º, 88% of the 
      dataset), ZEISS VISUSCOUT 100 (FOV 40º, 9%), and Optomed SmartScope M5 (FOV 40º, 
      3%). Image acquisition took 2 min per patient. Ground truth for each image of the 
      dataset was determined by 2 masked retina specialists, and disagreements were 
      resolved by a 3rd retina specialist. The specific pathologies considered for 
      evaluation were "diabetic retinopathy" (DR), "Age-related macular degeneration" 
      (AMD), "glaucomatous optic neuropathy" (GON), and "Nevus." Images with 
      maculopathy signs that did not match the described taxonomy were classified as 
      "Other." RESULTS: The combination of algorithms to detect any abnormalities had 
      an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.963 with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a 
      specificity of 86.8%. The algorithms individually obtained are as follows: AMD 
      AUC 0.980 (sensitivity 93.8%; specificity 95.7%), DR AUC 0.950 (sensitivity 
      81.1%; specificity 94.8%), GON AUC 0.889 (sensitivity 53.6% specificity 95.7%), 
      Nevus AUC 0.931 (sensitivity 86.7%; specificity 90.7%). CONCLUSION: Our holistic 
      AI approach reaches high diagnostic accuracy at simultaneous detection of DR, 
      AMD, and Nevus. The integration of pathology-specific algorithms permits higher 
      sensitivities with minimal impact on its specificity. It also reduces the risk of 
      missing incidental findings. Deep learning may facilitate wider screenings of eye 
      diseases.

AB  - Throughout ophthalmic history it has been shown that progress has gone hand in 
      hand with technological breakthroughs. In the past, fluorescein angiography and 
      fundus photographs were the most commonly used imaging modalities in the 
      management of diabetic macular edema (DME). Today, despite the moderate 
      correlation between macular thickness and functional outcomes, spectral domain 
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has become the DME workhorse in clinical 
      practice. Several SD-OCT biomarkers have been looked at including presence of 
      epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular adhesion, disorganization of the inner retinal 
      layers, central macular thickness, integrity of the ellipsoid layer, and 
      subretinal fluid, among others. Emerging imaging modalities include fundus 
      autofluorescence, macular pigment optical density, fluorescence lifetime imaging 
      ophthalmoscopy, OCT angiography, and adaptive optics. Technological advances in 
      imaging of the posterior segment of the eye have enabled ophthalmologists to 
      develop hypotheses about pathological mechanisms of disease, monitor disease 
      progression, and assess response to treatment. Spectral domain OCT is the most 
      commonly performed imaging modality in the management of DME. However, reliable 
      biomarkers have yet to be identified. Machine learning may provide treatment 
      algorithms based on multimodal imaging.

PG  - 308-314
LID - 10.1097/APO.0000000000000303 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of smartphone-based fundus imaging (SBFI), a low-cost alternative 
      to conventional digital fundus photography has become available. SBFI allows for 
      a mobile fundus examination, is applicable both with and without pupil dilation, 
      comes with built-in connectivity and post-processing capabilities, and is 
      relatively easy to master. Furthermore, it is delegable to paramedical 
      staff/technicians and, hence, suitable for telemedicine. Against this background 
      a variety of SBFI applications have become available including screening for 
      diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity and its 
      applications in emergency medicine and pediatrics. In addition, SBFI is 
      convenient for teaching purposes and might serve as a surrogate for direct 
      ophthalmoscopy. First wide-field montage techniques are available and the 
      combination of SBFI with machine learning algorithms for image analyses is 
      promising. In conclusion, SBFI has the potential to make fundus examinations and 
      screenings for patients particularly in low- and middle-income settings more 
      accessible and, therefore, aid tackling the burden of diabetic retinopathy, 
      glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity screening. However, image quality for 
      SBFI varies substantially and a reference standard for grading appears prudent. 
      In addition, there is a strong need for comparison of different SBFI approaches 
      in terms of applicability to disease screening and cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Optic Disk Detection in Fundus Image Based on Structured Learning.
PG  - 224-234
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2723678 [doi]
AB  - Automated optic disk (OD) detection plays an important role in developing a 
      computer aided system for eye diseases. In this paper, we propose an algorithm 
      for the OD detection based on structured learning. A classifier model is trained 
      based on structured learning. Then, we use the model to achieve the edge map of 
      OD. Thresholding is performed on the edge map, thus a binary image of the OD is 
      obtained. Finally, circle Hough transform is carried out to approximate the 
      boundary of OD by a circle. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on three 
      public datasets and obtained promising results. The results (an area overlap and 
      Dices coefficients of 0.8605 and 0.9181, respectively, an accuracy of 0.9777, and 
      a true positive and false positive fraction of 0.9183 and 0.0102) show that the 
      proposed method is very competitive with the state-of-the-art methods and is a 
      reliable tool for the segmentation of OD.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major ocular complication of diabetes mellitus, 
      and is a problem with significant global health impact. Major advances in 
      diagnostics, technology and treatment have already revolutionized how we manage 
      DR in the early part of the 21(st) century. For example, the accessibility of 
      imaging with optical coherence tomography, and the development of anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment are just some of the landmark 
      developments that have shaped the DR landscape over the last few decades. Yet, 
      there are still more exciting advances being made. Looking forward to 2030, many 
      of these ongoing developments are likely to further transform the field. First, 
      epidemiologic projections show that the global burden of DR is not only 
      increasing, but also shifting from high-income countries towards middle- and 
      low-income areas. Second, better understanding of disease pathophysiology is 
      placing greater emphasis on retinal neural dysfunction and non-vascular aspects 
      of diabetic retinal disease. Third, a wealth of information is becoming available 
      from newer imaging modalities such as widefield imaging systems and optical 
      coherence tomography angiography. Fourth, artificial intelligence for screening, 
      diagnosis and prognostication of DR will become increasingly accessible and 
      important. Fifth, new pharmacologic agents targeting other non-VEGF-driven 
      pathways, and novel therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy are being 
      developed for DR. Finally, the classification system for diabetic retinal disease 
      will need to be continually updated to keep pace with new developments. In this 
      article, we discuss these major trends in DR that we expect to see in 2030 and 
      beyond.

AB  - Microvascular problems of diabetes, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular 
      edema, can be seen in the eye's retina, and the retinal images are being used to 
      screen for and diagnose the illness manually. Using deep learning to automate 
      this time-consuming process might be quite beneficial. In this paper, a deep 
      neural network, i.e., convolutional neural network, has been proposed for 
      predicting diabetes through retinal images. Before applying the deep neural 
      network, the dataset is preprocessed and normalised for classification. Deep 
      neural network is constructed by using 7 layers, 5 kernels, and ReLU activation 
      function, and MaxPooling is implemented to combine important features. Finally, 
      the model is implemented to classify whether the retinal image belongs to a 
      diabetic or nondiabetic class. The parameters used for evaluating the model are 
      accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The implemented model has achieved a 
      training accuracy of more than 95%, which is much better than the other states of 
      the art algorithms.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated generative methods to potentially mitigate 
      artificial intelligence (AI) bias when diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      resulting from training data imbalance or domain generalization, which occurs 
      when deep learning systems (DLSs) face concepts at test/inference time they were 
      not initially trained on. METHODS: The public domain Kaggle EyePACS dataset 
      (88,692 fundi and 44,346 individuals, originally diverse for ethnicity) was 
      modified by adding clinician-annotated labels and constructing an artificial 
      scenario of data imbalance and domain generalization by disallowing training (but 
      not testing) exemplars for images of retinas with DR warranting referral 
      (DR-referable) from darker-skin individuals, who presumably have greater 
      concentration of melanin within uveal melanocytes, on average, contributing to 
      retinal image pigmentation. A traditional/baseline diagnostic DLS was compared 
      against new DLSs that would use training data augmented via generative models for 
      debiasing. RESULTS: Accuracy (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of the baseline 
      diagnostics DLS for fundus images of lighter-skin individuals was 73.0% (66.9% to 
      79.2%) versus darker-skin of 60.5% (53.5% to 67.3%), demonstrating bias/disparity 
      (delta = 12.5%; Welch t-test t = 2.670, P = 0.008) in AI performance across 
      protected subpopulations. Using novel generative methods for addressing missing 
      subpopulation training data (DR-referable darker-skin) achieved instead accuracy, 
      for lighter-skin, of 72.0% (65.8% to 78.2%), and for darker-skin, of 71.5% (65.2% 
      to 77.8%), demonstrating closer parity (delta = 0.5%) in accuracy across 
      subpopulations (Welch t-test t = 0.111, P = 0.912). CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      illustrate how data imbalance and domain generalization can lead to disparity of 
      accuracy across subpopulations, and show that novel generative methods of 
      synthetic fundus images may play a role for debiasing AI. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: New AI methods have possible applications to address potential AI bias 
      in DR diagnostics from fundus pigmentation, and potentially other ophthalmic DLSs 
      too.

AB  - The accuracy and interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) are crucial for 
      the advancement of optical coherence tomography (OCT) image detection, as it can 
      greatly reduce the manual labor required by clinicians. By prioritizing these 
      aspects during development and application, we can make significant progress 
      towards streamlining the clinical workflow. In this paper, we propose an 
      explainable ensemble approach that utilizes transfer learning to detect fundus 
      lesion diseases through OCT imaging. Our study utilized a publicly available OCT 
      dataset consisting of normal subjects, patients with dry age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD), and patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), each with 15 
      samples. The impact of pre-trained weights on the performance of individual 
      networks was first compared, and then these networks were ensemble using majority 
      soft polling. Finally, the features learned by the networks were visualized using 
      Grad-CAM and CAM. The use of pre-trained ImageNet weights improved the 
      performance from 68.17% to 92.89%. The ensemble model consisting of the three CNN 
      models with pre-trained parameters loaded performed best, correctly 
      distinguishing between AMD patients, DME patients and normal subjects 100% of the 
      time. Visualization results showed that Grad-CAM could display the lesion area 
      more accurately. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach could have good 
      performance of both accuracy and interpretability in retinal OCT image detection.

TI  - A single-step regression method based on transformer for retinal layer 
      segmentation.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac799a [doi]
AB  - The shape and structure of retinal layers are basic characteristics for the 
      diagnosis of many ophthalmological diseases. Based on B-Scans of optical 
      coherence tomography, most of retinal layer segmentation methods are composed of 
      two-steps: classifying pixels and extracting retinal layers, in which the 
      optimization of two independent steps decreases the accuracy. Although the 
      methods based on deep learning are highly accurate, they require a large amount 
      of labeled data. This paper proposes a single-step method based on transformer 
      for retinal layer segmentation, which is trained by axial data (A-Scans), to 
      obtain the boundary of each layer. The proposed method was evaluated on two 
      public data sets. The first one contains eight retinal layer boundaries for 
      diabetic macular edema, and the second one contains nine retinal layer boundaries 
      for healthy controls and subjects with multiple sclerosis. Its absolute average 
      distance errors are 0.99 pixels and 3.67 pixels, respectively, for the two sets, 
      and its root mean square error is 1.29 pixels for the latter set. In addition, 
      its accuracy is acceptable even if the training data is reduced to 0.3. The 
      proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the 
      correct topology and requires less labeled data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the main cause of irreversible vision 
      loss in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), resulting in a certain burden to 
      patients and society. With the increasing incidence of DME, more and more 
      researchers are focusing on it. METHODS: The papers related to DME between 2012 
      and 2022 from the Web of Science core Collection were searched in this study. 
      Based on CiteSpace and VOS viewer, these publications were analyzed in terms of 
      spatiotemporal distribution, author distribution, subject classification, topic 
      distribution, and citations. RESULTS: A total of 5165 publications on DME were 
      included. The results showed that the research on DME is on a steady growth 
      trend. The country with the highest number of published documents was the US. 
      Wong Tien Yin from Tsinghua University was the author with the most published 
      articles. The journal of Retina, the Journal of Retinal and Vitreous Diseases had 
      a large number of publications. The article "Mechanisms of macular edema: Beyond 
      the surface" was the highly cited literature and "Aflibercept, bevacizumab, or 
      ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema" had the highest co-citation frequency. 
      The treatment, diagnosis, pathogenesis, as well as etiology and epidemiological 
      investigation of DME, have been the current research direction. Deep learning has 
      been widely used in the medical field for its strong feature representation 
      ability. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the important authoritative literature, 
      journals, institutions, scholars, countries, research hotspots, and development 
      trends in in the field of DME. This indicates that communication and cooperation 
      between disciplines, universities, and countries are crucial. It can advance 
      research in DME and even ophthalmology.

AB  - Untreated age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 
      glaucoma may lead to irreversible vision loss. Hence, it is essential to have 
      regular eye screening to detect these eye diseases at an early stage and to offer 
      treatment where appropriate. One of the simplest, non-invasive and cost-effective 
      techniques to screen the eyes is by using fundus photo imaging. But, the manual 
      evaluation of fundus images is tedious and challenging. Further, the diagnosis 
      made by ophthalmologists may be subjective. Therefore, an objective and novel 
      algorithm using the pyramid histogram of visual words (PHOW) and Fisher vectors 
      is proposed for the classification of fundus images into their respective eye 
      conditions (normal, AMD, DR, and glaucoma). The proposed algorithm extracts 
      features which are represented as words. These features are built and encoded 
      into a Fisher vector for classification using random forest classifier. This 
      proposed algorithm is validated with both blindfold and ten-fold cross-validation 
      techniques. An accuracy of 90.06% is achieved with the blindfold method, and 
      highest accuracy of 96.79% is obtained with ten-fold cross-validation. The 
      highest classification performance of our system shows the potential of deploying 
      it in polyclinics to assist healthcare professionals in their initial diagnosis 
      of the eye. Our developed system can reduce the workload of ophthalmologists 
      significantly.

AB  - Deep neural networks can extract clinical information, such as diabetic 
      retinopathy status and individual characteristics (e.g. age and sex), from 
      retinal images. Here, we report the first study to train deep learning models 
      with retinal images from 3,000 Qatari citizens participating in the Qatar Biobank 
      study. We investigated whether fundus images can predict cardiometabolic 
      risk factors, such as age, sex, blood pressure, smoking status, glycaemic status, 
      total lipid panel, sex steroid hormones and bioimpedance measurements. 
      Additionally, the role of age and sex as mediating factors when predicting 
      cardiometabolic risk factors from fundus images was studied. Predictions at 
      person-level were made by combining information of an optic disc centred and a 
      macula centred image of both eyes with deep learning models using the 
      MobileNet-V2 architecture. An accurate prediction was obtained for age (mean 
      absolute error (MAE): 2.78 years) and sex (area under the curve: 0.97), while an 
      acceptable performance was achieved for systolic blood pressure (MAE: 8.96 mmHg), 
      diastolic blood pressure (MAE: 6.84 mmHg), Haemoglobin A1c (MAE: 0.61%), relative 
      fat mass (MAE: 5.68 units) and testosterone (MAE: 3.76 nmol/L). We discovered 
      that age and sex were mediating factors when predicting cardiometabolic risk 
      factors from fundus images. We have found that deep learning models indirectly 
      predict sex when trained for testosterone. For blood pressure, Haemoglobin A1c 
      and relative fat mass an influence of age and sex was observed. However, achieved 
      performance cannot be fully explained by the influence of age and sex. In 
      conclusion we confirm that age and sex can be predicted reliably from a fundus 
      image and that unique information is stored in the retina that relates to blood 
      pressure, Haemoglobin A1c and relative fat mass. Future research should focus on 
      stratification when predicting person characteristics from a fundus image.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to revolutionise the practice of 
      medicine. Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have demonstrated 
      success in variety of clinical tasks: detecting diabetic retinopathy from images, 
      predicting hospital readmissions, aiding in the discovery of new drugs, etc. AI's 
      progress in medicine, however, has led to concerns regarding the potential 
      effects of this technology on relationships of trust in clinical practice. In 
      this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems 
      can be relied on, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are 
      not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely on AI 
      systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce 
      a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.

TI  - Automated Machine Learning for Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy Progression From 
      Ultra-Widefield Retinal Images.
PG  - 171-177
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.6318 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to identify eyes 
      with early diabetic retinopathy (DR) at increased risk for disease progression. 
      OBJECTIVE: To create and validate automated ML models (autoML) for DR progression 
      from ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal images. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Deidentified UWF images with mild or moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR) with 3 
      years of longitudinal follow-up retinal imaging or evidence of progression within 
      3 years were used to develop automated ML models for predicting DR progression in 
      UWF images. All images were collected from a tertiary diabetes-specific medical 
      center retinal image dataset. Data were collected from July to September 2022. 
      EXPOSURE: Automated ML models were generated from baseline on-axis 200° UWF 
      retinal images. Baseline retinal images were labeled for progression based on 
      centralized reading center evaluation of baseline and follow-up images according 
      to the clinical Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. Images 
      for model development were split 8-1-1 for training, optimization, and testing to 
      detect 1 or more steps of DR progression. Validation was performed using a 
      328-image set from the same patient population not used in model development. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 1179 deidentified UWF 
      images with mild (380 [32.2%]) or moderate (799 [67.8%]) NPDR were included. DR 
      progression was present in half of the training set (590 of 1179 [50.0%]). The 
      model's AUPRC was 0.717 for baseline mild NPDR and 0.863 for moderate NPDR. On 
      the validation set for eyes with mild NPDR, sensitivity was 0.72 (95% CI, 
      0.57-0.83), specificity was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.57-0.69), prevalence was 0.15 (95% 
      CI, 0.12-0.20), and accuracy was 64.3%; for eyes with moderate NPDR, sensitivity 
      was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.87), specificity was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66-0.76), 
      prevalence was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.19-0.27), and accuracy was 73.8%. In the 
      validation set, 6 of 9 eyes (75%) with mild NPDR and 35 of 41 eyes (85%) with 
      moderate NPDR progressed 2 steps or more were identified. All 4 eyes with mild 
      NPDR that progressed within 6 months and 1 year were identified, and 8 of 9 (89%) 
      and 17 of 20 (85%) with moderate NPDR that progressed within 6 months and 1 year, 
      respectively, were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates 
      the accuracy and feasibility of automated ML models for identifying DR 
      progression developed using UWF images, especially for prediction of 2-step or 
      greater DR progression within 1 year. Potentially, the use of ML algorithms may 
      refine the risk of disease progression and identify those at highest short-term 
      risk, thus reducing costs and improving vision-related outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of automatically quantified 
      macular fluid volume (MFV) for treatment-required diabetic macular edema (DME). 
      Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included eyes with DME. The 
      commercial software on optical coherence tomography (OCT) produced the central 
      subfield thickness (CST), and a custom deep-learning algorithm automatically 
      segmented the fluid cysts and quantified the MFV from the volumetric scans of an 
      OCT angiography system. Retina specialists treated patients per standard of care 
      based on clinical and OCT findings without access to the MFV. The main outcome 
      measures were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 
      sensitivity, and specificity of the CST, MFV, and visual acuity (VA) for 
      treatment indication. Results: Of 139 eyes, 39 (28%) were treated for DME during 
      the study period and 101 (72%) were previously treated. The algorithm detected 
      fluid in all eyes; however, only 54 eyes (39%) met the DRCR.net criteria for 
      center-involved ME. The AUROC of MFV predicting a treatment decision of 0.81 was 
      greater than that of CST (0.67) (P = .0048). Untreated eyes that met the optimal 
      threshold for treatment-required DME based on MFV (>0.031 mm(3)) had better VA 
      than treated eyes (P = .0053). A multivariate logistic regression model showed 
      that MFV (P = .0008) and VA (P = .0061) were significantly associated with a 
      treatment decision, but CST was not. Conclusions: MFV had a higher correlation 
      with the need for treatment for DME than CST and may be especially useful for 
      ongoing management of DME.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photographs of the external eye were recently shown to reveal signs 
      of diabetic retinal disease and elevated glycated haemoglobin. This study aimed 
      to test the hypothesis that external eye photographs contain information about 
      additional systemic medical conditions. METHODS: We developed a deep learning 
      system (DLS) that takes external eye photographs as input and predicts systemic 
      parameters, such as those related to the liver (albumin, aspartate 
      aminotransferase [AST]); kidney (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 
      urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR]); bone or mineral (calcium); thyroid 
      (thyroid stimulating hormone); and blood (haemoglobin, white blood cells [WBC], 
      platelets). This DLS was trained using 123 130 images from 38 398 patients with 
      diabetes undergoing diabetic eye screening in 11 sites across Los Angeles county, 
      CA, USA. Evaluation focused on nine prespecified systemic parameters and 
      leveraged three validation sets (A, B, C) spanning 25 510 patients with and 
      without diabetes undergoing eye screening in three independent sites in Los 
      Angeles county, CA, and the greater Atlanta area, GA, USA. We compared 
      performance against baseline models incorporating available clinicodemographic 
      variables (eg, age, sex, race and ethnicity, years with diabetes). FINDINGS: 
      Relative to the baseline, the DLS achieved statistically significant superior 
      performance at detecting AST >36·0 U/L, calcium <8·6 mg/dL, eGFR <60·0 
      mL/min/1·73 m(2), haemoglobin <11·0 g/dL, platelets <150·0 × 10(3)/μL, ACR ≥300 
      mg/g, and WBC <4·0 × 10(3)/μL on validation set A (a population resembling the 
      development datasets), with the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AUC) of the DLS exceeding that of the baseline by 5·3-19·9% (absolute 
      differences in AUC). On validation sets B and C, with substantial patient 
      population differences compared with the development datasets, the DLS 
      outperformed the baseline for ACR ≥300·0 mg/g and haemoglobin <11·0 g/dL by 
      7·3-13·2%. INTERPRETATION: We found further evidence that external eye 
      photographs contain biomarkers spanning multiple organ systems. Such biomarkers 
      could enable accessible and non-invasive screening of disease. Further work is 
      needed to understand the translational implications. FUNDING: Google.

AB  - Developers proposing new machine learning for health (ML4H) tools often pledge to 
      match or even surpass the performance of existing tools, yet the reality is 
      usually more complicated. Reliable deployment of ML4H to the real world is 
      challenging as examples from diabetic retinopathy or Covid-19 screening show. We 
      envision an integrated framework of algorithm auditing and quality control that 
      provides a path towards the effective and reliable application of ML systems in 
      healthcare. In this editorial, we give a summary of ongoing work towards that 
      vision and announce a call for participation to the special issue  Machine 
      Learning for Health: Algorithm Auditing & Quality Control in this journal to 
      advance the practice of ML4H auditing.

TI  - Three-dimensional diabetic macular edema thickness maps based on fluid 
      segmentation and fovea detection using deep learning.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.18240/ijo.2022.03.19 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore a more accurate quantifying diagnosis method of diabetic macular 
      edema (DME) by displaying detailed 3D morphometry beyond the gold-standard 
      quantification indicator-central retinal thickness (CRT) and apply it in 
      follow-up of DME patients. METHODS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of 
      229 eyes from 160 patients were collected. We manually annotated cystoid macular 
      edema (CME), subretinal fluid (SRF) and fovea as ground truths. Deep convolution 
      neural networks (DCNNs) were constructed including U-Net, sASPP, HRNetV2-W48, and 
      HRNetV2-W48+Object-Contextual Representation (OCR) for fluid (CME+SRF) 
      segmentation and fovea detection respectively, based on which the thickness maps 
      of CME, SRF and retina were generated and divided by Early Treatment Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid. RESULTS: In fluid segmentation, with the best 
      DCNN constructed and loss function, the dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 
      segmentation reached 0.78 (CME), 0.82 (SRF), and 0.95 (retina). In fovea 
      detection, the average deviation between the predicted fovea and the ground truth 
      reached 145.7±117.8 µm. The generated macular edema thickness maps are able to 
      discover center-involved DME by intuitive morphometry and fluid volume, which is 
      ignored by the traditional definition of CRT>250 µm. Thickness maps could also 
      help to discover fluid above or below the fovea center ignored or underestimated 
      by a single OCT B-scan. CONCLUSION: Compared to the traditional unidimensional 
      indicator-CRT, 3D macular edema thickness maps are able to display more intuitive 
      morphometry and detailed statistics of DME, supporting more accurate diagnoses 
      and follow-up of DME patients.

TI  - Structure-Preserving Guided Retinal Image Filtering and Its Application for Optic 
      Disk Analysis.
PG  - 2536-2546
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2018.2838550 [doi]
AB  - Retinal fundus photographs have been used in the diagnosis of many ocular 
      diseases such as glaucoma, pathological myopia, age-related macular degeneration, 
      and diabetic retinopathy. With the development of computer science, computer 
      aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyze the retinal images 
      automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the quality of the 
      retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in human lens will 
      attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which reduces the 
      quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the retinal images and 
      posts challenges in retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In this paper, 
      we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a combination of 
      human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel structure-preserving guided 
      retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to restore images based on the 
      attenuation and scattering model. The proposed SGRIF consists of a step of global 
      structure transferring and a step of global edge-preserving smoothing. Our 
      results show that the proposed SGRIF method is able to improve the contrast of 
      retinal images, measured by histogram flatness measure, histogram spread, and 
      variability of local luminosity. In addition, we further explored the benefits of 
      SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In the two 
      applications of deep learning-based optic cup segmentation and sparse 
      learning-based cup-to-disk ratio (CDR) computation, our results show that we are 
      able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation and CDR measurements from 
      images processed by SGRIF.

TI  - A computer-aided diagnostic system for detecting diabetic retinopathy in optical 
      coherence tomography images.
PG  - 914-923
LID - 10.1002/mp.12071 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Detection (diagnosis) of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) images for patients with type 2 diabetes, but almost clinically 
      normal retina appearances. METHODS: The proposed computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) 
      system detects the DR in three steps: (a) localizing and segmenting 12 distinct 
      retinal layers on the OCT image; (b) deriving features of the segmented layers, 
      and (c) learning most discriminative features and classifying each subject as 
      normal or diabetic. To localise and segment the retinal layers, signals 
      (intensities) of the OCT image are described with a joint Markov-Gibbs random 
      field (MGRF) model of intensities and shape descriptors. Each segmented layer is 
      characterized with cumulative probability distribution functions (CDF) of its 
      locally extracted features, such as reflectivity, curvature, and thickness. A 
      multistage deep fusion classification network (DFCN) with a stack of 
      non-negativity-constrained autoencoders (NCAE) is trained to select the most 
      discriminative retinal layers' features and use their CDFs for detecting the DR. 
      A training atlas was built using the OCT scans for 12 normal subjects and their 
      maps of layers hand-drawn by retina experts. RESULTS: Preliminary experiments on 
      52 clinical OCT scans (26 normal and 26 with early-stage DR, balanced between 
      40-79 yr old males and females; 40 training and 12 test subjects) gave the DR 
      detection accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92%; 83%, and 100%, 
      respectively. The 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity have been obtained 
      in the leave-one-out cross-validation test for all the 52 subjects. CONCLUSION: 
      Both the quantitative and visual assessments confirmed the high accuracy of the 
      proposed computer-assisted diagnostic system for early DR detection using the OCT 
      retinal images.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between choroidal thickness and myopia 
      progression using a deep learning method. METHODS: Two data sets, data set A and 
      data set B, comprising of 123 optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes, were 
      collected to establish the model and verify its clinical utility. The proposed 
      mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model, trained with the 
      pretrained weights from the Common Objects in Context database as well as the 
      manually labeled OCT images from data set A, was used to automatically segment 
      the choroid. To verify its clinical utility, the mask R-CNN model was tested with 
      data set B, and the choroidal thickness estimated by the model was also used to 
      explore its relationship with myopia. RESULTS: Compared with the result of manual 
      segmentation in data set B, the error of the automatic choroidal inner and outer 
      boundary segmentation was 6.72 ± 2.12 and 13.75 ± 7.57 µm, respectively. The mean 
      dice coefficient between the region segmented by automatic and manual methods was 
      93.87% ± 2.89%. The mean difference in choroidal thickness over the Early 
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study zone between the two methods was 10.52 µm. 
      Additionally, the choroidal thickness estimated using the proposed model was 
      thinner in high-myopic eyes, and axial length was the most significant predictor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The mask R-CNN model has excellent performance in choroidal 
      segmentation and quantification. In addition, the choroid of high myopia is 
      significantly thinner than that of nonhigh myopia. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This 
      work lays the foundations for mask R-CNN models that could aid in the evaluation 
      of more intricate changes occurring in chorioretinal diseases.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Predictive Modeling of Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 
      Diabetes Using Integrated Biomarkers: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.
PG  - 1987-1997
LID - 10.2147/DMSO.S458263 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a major complication of diabetes mellitus, 
      significantly impacts global health. Identifying individuals at risk of 
      developing DN is crucial for early intervention and improving patient outcomes. 
      This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based predictive model 
      using integrated biomarkers. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 
      a baseline dataset involving 2184 participants without DN, categorized based on 
      their development of DN over a follow-up period of 36 months: DN (n=1270) and 
      Non-DN (n=914). Various demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed. The 
      findings were validated using an independent dataset comprising 468 participants, 
      with 273 developing DN and 195 remaining as Non-DN over the follow-up period. 
      Machine learning algorithms, alongside traditional descriptive statistics and 
      logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Elevated levels 
      of serum creatinine, urea, and reduced eGFR, alongside an increased prevalence of 
      retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, were prominently observed in those who 
      developed DN. Validation on the independent dataset further confirmed the model's 
      robustness and consistency. The SVM model demonstrated superior performance in 
      the training set (AUC=0.79, F1-score=0.74) and testing set (AUC=0.83, 
      F1-score=0.82), outperforming other models. Significant predictors of DN included 
      serum creatinine, eGFR, presence of diabetic retinopathy, and peripheral 
      neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Integrating machine learning algorithms with clinical and 
      biomarker data at baseline offers a promising avenue for identifying individuals 
      at risk of developing diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes patients over a 
      36-month period.

TI  - Prediction of complications in diabetes mellitus using machine learning models 
      with transplanted topic model features.
PG  - 163-171
LID - 10.1007/s13534-023-00322-7 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aims to predict the progression of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) 
      from the clinical notes through machine learning based on latent Dirichlet 
      allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Particularly, 174,427 clinical notes of DM 
      patients were collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) system of the 
      Seoul National University Hospital outpatient clinic. Method: We developed a 
      model to predict the development of DM complications. Topics developed by the 
      topic model were exploited as the key feature of our machine-learning model. The 
      proposed model generalized a correlation between topic structures and 
      complications. Results: The model provided acceptable predictive performance for 
      all four types of complications (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, 
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cerebrovascular accident). Upon employing 
      extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), we obtained the F1 scores of the predictions 
      for each complication type as 0.844, 0.921, 0.831, and 0.762. Conclusion: This 
      study shows that a machine learning project based on topic modeling can 
      effectively predict the progress of a disease. Furthermore, a unique way of topic 
      model transplanting, which matches the dimension of the topic structures of the 
      two data sets, is presented. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version 
      contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-023-00322-7.

TI  - Diabetes prediction using machine learning and explainable AI techniques.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1049/htl2.12039 [doi]
AB  - Globally, diabetes affects 537 million people, making it the deadliest and the 
      most common non-communicable disease. Many factors can cause a person to get 
      affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, 
      family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is 
      one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long 
      time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve 
      damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted 
      early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed 
      using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine 
      learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and 
      collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in 
      Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in 
      this work. A semi-supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been 
      utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN 
      approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors 
      used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random 
      Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine 
      which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and 
      testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best 
      result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 
      F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has 
      been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The 
      explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to 
      understand how the model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework 
      and an Android smartphone application have been developed to input various 
      features and predict diabetes instantaneously. The private dataset of female 
      Bangladeshi patients and programming codes are available at the following link:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (SD-OCT) is most 
      widely imaging equipment used in ophthalmology to detect diabetic macular edema 
      (DME). Indeed, it offers an accurate visualization of the morphology of the 
      retina as well as the retina layers. METHODS: The dataset used in this study has 
      been acquired by the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), using CIRRUS TM 
      (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA, USA) SD-OCT device. The dataset consists 
      of 32 OCT volumes (16 DME and 16 normal cases). Each volume contains 128 B-scans 
      with resolution of 1024 px × 512 px, resulting in more than 3800 images being 
      processed. All SD-OCT volumes are read and assessed by trained graders and 
      identified as normal or DME cases based on evaluation of retinal thickening, hard 
      exudates, intraretinal cystoid space formation, and subretinal fluid. Within the 
      DME sub-set, a large number of lesions has been selected to create a rather 
      complete and diverse DME dataset. This paper presents an automatic classification 
      framework for SD-OCT volumes in order to identify DME versus normal volumes. In 
      this regard, a generic pipeline including pre-processing, feature detection, 
      feature representation, and classification was investigated. More precisely, 
      extraction of histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern (LBP) 
      features within a multiresolution approach is used as well as principal component 
      analysis (PCA) and bag of words (BoW) representations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 
      Besides comparing individual and combined features, different representation 
      approaches and different classifiers are evaluated. The best results are obtained 
      for LBP[Formula: see text] vectors while represented and classified using PCA and 
      a linear-support vector machine (SVM), leading to a sensitivity(SE) and 
      specificity (SP) of 87.5 and 87.5%, respectively.

TI  - NFN＋: A novel network followed network for retinal vessel segmentation.

AB  - In the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, the morphological attributes of 
      blood vessels play an essential role to construct a retinal computer-aided 
      diagnosis system. However, due to the challenges including limited densely 
      annotated data, inter-vessel differences and structured prediction problem, it 
      remains challenging to segment accurately the retinal vessels, particularly the 
      capillaries on color fundus images. To address these issues, in this paper, we 
      propose a novel deep learning-based model called NFN＋ to effectively extract 
      multi-scale information and make full use of deep feature maps. In NFN＋, the 
      front network converts an image patch into a probabilistic retinal vessel map, 
      and the followed network further refines the map to achieve a better 
      post-processing module, which helps represent the vessel structures implicitly. 
      We employ the inter-network skip connections to unite two identical multi-scale 
      backbones, which enables the useful multi-scale features to be directly 
      transferred from shallow layers to deeper layers. The refined probabilistic 
      retinal vessel maps produced from the augmented images are then averaged to 
      construct the segmentation results. We evaluated this model on the digital 
      retinal images for vessel extraction (DRIVE), structured analysis of the retina 
      (STARE), and the child heart and health study (CHASE) databases. Our results 
      indicate that the elaborated cascaded designs can produce performance gain and 
      the proposed NFN＋ model, to our best knowledge, achieved the state-of-the-art 
      retinal vessel segmentation accuracy on color fundus images (AUC: 98.30%, 98.75% 
      and 98.94%, respectively).

TI  - Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis Based on Convolutional Neural Network in the 
      Russian Population: A Multicenter Prospective Study.
LID - 10.2174/0115733998268034231101091236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy is the most common complication of diabetes 
      mellitus and is one of the leading causes of vision impairment globally, which is 
      also relevant for the Russian Federation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic 
      efficiency of a convolutional neural network trained for the detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy and estimation of its severity in fundus images of the 
      Russian population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional multicenter study, the 
      training data set was obtained from an open source and relabeled by a group of 
      independent retina specialists; the sample size was 60,000 eyes. The test sample 
      was recruited prospectively, 1186 fundus photographs of 593 patients were 
      collected. The reference standard was the result of independent grading of the 
      diabetic retinopathy stage by ophthalmologists. RESULTS: Sensitivity and 
      specificity were 95.0% (95% CI; 90.8-96.4) and 96.8% (95% CI; 95.5- 99.0), 
      respectively; positive predictive value - 98.8% (95% CI; 97.6-99.2); negative 
      predictive value - 87.1% (95% CI, 83.4-96.5); accuracy - 95.9% (95% CI; 
      93.3-97.1); Kappa score - 0.887 (95% CI; 0.839-0.946); F1score - 0.909 (95% CI; 
      0.870-0.957); area under the ROC-curve - 95.9% (95% CI; 93.3-97.1). There was no 
      statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the group 
      with isolated diabetic retinopathy and those with hypertensive retinopathy as a 
      concomitant diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The method for diagnosing DR presented in this 
      article has shown its high accuracy, which is consistent with the existing world 
      analogues, however, this method should prove its clinical efficiency in large 
      multicenter multinational controlled randomized studies, in which the reference 
      diagnostic method would be unified and less subjective than an ophthalmologist.

TI  - Risk-Profile and Feature Selection Comparison in Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11121327 [doi]
LID - 1327
AB  - One of the main microvascular complications presented in the Mexican population 
      is diabetic retinopathy which affects 27.50% of individuals with type 2 diabetes. 
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a predictive model to find 
      out the risk factors of this complication. The dataset contained a total of 298 
      subjects, including clinical and paraclinical features. An analysis was 
      constructed using machine learning techniques including Boruta as a feature 
      selection method, and random forest as classification algorithm. The model was 
      evaluated through a statistical test based on sensitivity, specificity, area 
      under the curve (AUC), and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 
      results present significant values obtained by the model obtaining 69% of AUC. 
      Moreover, a risk evaluation was incorporated to evaluate the impact of the 
      predictors. The proposed method identifies creatinine, lipid treatment, 
      glomerular filtration rate, waist hip ratio, total cholesterol, and high density 
      lipoprotein as risk factors in Mexican subjects. The odds ratio increases by 
      3.5916 times for control patients which have high levels of cholesterol. It is 
      possible to conclude that this proposed methodology is a preliminary 
      computer-aided diagnosis tool for clinical decision-helping to identify the 
      diagnosis of DR.

TI  - Multiplatform tear proteomic profiling reveals novel non-invasive biomarkers for 
      diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate a comprehensive proteomic profile of the tear fluid in 
      patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and further define non-invasive 
      biomarkers. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multicentre study that includes 46 
      patients with DR, 28 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and 30 healthy 
      controls (HC). Tear samples were collected with Schirmer strips. As for the 
      discovery set, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry was used to 
      characterize the tear proteomic profile. Differentially expressed proteins 
      between groups were identified, with gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis further developed. 
      Classifying performance of biomarkers for distinguishing DR from DM was compared 
      by the combination of three machine-learning algorithms. The selected biomarker 
      panel was tested in the validation cohort using parallel reaction monitoring mass 
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Among 3364 proteins quantified, 235 and 88 differentially 
      expressed proteins were identified for DR when compared to HC and DM, 
      respectively, which were fundamentally related to retina homeostasis, 
      inflammation and immunity, oxidative stress, angiogenesis and coagulation, 
      metabolism, and cellular adhesion processes. The biomarker panel consisting of 
      NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-2 (SIR2), amine oxidase 
      [flavin-containing] B (AOFB), and U8 snoRNA-decapping enzyme (NUD16) exhibited 
      the best diagnostic performance in discriminating DR from DM, with AUCs of 0.933 
      and 0.881 in the discovery and validation set, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tear 
      protein dysregulation is comprehensively revealed to be associated with DR onset. 
      The combination of tear SIR2, AOFB, and NUD16 can be a novel potential approach 
      for non-invasive detection or pre-screening of DR. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a machine-learning image processing model for 
      three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of vitreous anatomy visualized with 
      swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS: Healthy subjects 
      were imaged with SS-OCT. Scans of sufficient quality were transferred into the 
      Fiji is just ImageJ image processing toolkit, and proportions of the resulting 
      stacks were adjusted to form cubic voxels. Image-averaging and Trainable Weka 
      Segmentation using Sobel and variance edge detection and directional membrane 
      projections filters were used to enhance and interpret the signals from vitreous 
      gel, liquid spaces within the vitreous, and interfaces between the former. Two 
      classes were defined: "Septa" and "Other." Pixels were selected and added to each 
      class to train the classifier. Results were generated as a probability map. 
      Thresholding was performed to remove pixels that were classified with low 
      confidence. Volume rendering was performed with TomViz. RESULTS: Forty-seven eyes 
      of 34 healthy subjects were imaged with SS-OCT. Thirty-four cube scans from 25 
      subjects were of sufficient quality for volume rendering. Clinically relevant 
      vitreous features including the premacular bursa, area of Martegiani, and 
      prevascular vitreous fissures and cisterns, as well as varying degrees of 
      vitreous degeneration were visualized in 3D. CONCLUSIONS: A machine-learning 
      model for 3D vitreous reconstruction of SS-OCT cube scans was developed. The 
      resultant high-resolution 3D movies illustrated vitreous anatomy in a manner like 
      triamcinolone-assisted vitrectomy or postmortem dye injection. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: This machine learning model now allows for comprehensive examination 
      of the vitreous structure beyond the vitreoretinal interface in 3D with potential 
      applications for common disease states such as the vitreomacular traction and 
      Macular Hole spectrum of diseases or proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Evaluating the utility of deep learning for predicting therapeutic response in 
      diabetic eye disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Deep learning (DL) is a technique explored within ophthalmology that 
      requires large datasets to distinguish feature representations with high 
      diagnostic performance. There is a need for developing DL approaches to predict 
      therapeutic response, but completed clinical trial datasets are limited in size. 
      Predicting treatment response is more complex than disease diagnosis, where 
      hallmarks of treatment response are subtle. This study seeks to understand the 
      utility of DL for clinical problems in ophthalmology such as predicting treatment 
      response and where large sample sizes for model training are not available. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four DL architectures were trained using cross-validated 
      transfer learning to classify ultra-widefield angiograms (UWFA) and 
      fluid-compartmentalized optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from a 
      completed clinical trial (PERMEATE) dataset (n=29) as tolerating or requiring 
      extended interval Anti-VEGF dosing. UWFA images (n=217) from the Anti-VEGF study 
      were divided into five increasingly larger subsets to evaluate the influence of 
      dataset size on performance. Class activation maps (CAMs) were generated to 
      identify regions of model attention. RESULTS: The best performing DL model had a 
      mean AUC of 0.507 ± 0.042 on UWFA images, and highest observed AUC of 0.503 for 
      fluid-compartmentalized OCT images. DL had a best performing AUC of 0.634 when 
      dataset size was incrementally increased. Resulting CAMs show inconsistent 
      regions of interest. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the limitations of DL 
      for predicting therapeutic response when large datasets were not available for 
      model training. Our findings suggest the need for hand-crafted approaches for 
      complex and data scarce prediction problems in ophthalmology.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems 
      embedded in a mobile, handheld retinal camera, with a single retinal image 
      protocol, in detecting both diabetic retinopathy (DR) and more-than-mild diabetic 
      retinopathy (mtmDR). DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic study, 
      conducted at 3 diabetes care and eye care facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 
      327 individuals with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) underwent a retinal 
      imaging protocol enabling expert reading and automated analysis. METHODS: 
      Participants underwent fundus photographs using a portable retinal camera 
      (Phelcom Eyer). The captured images were automatically analyzed by deep learning 
      algorithms retinal alteration score (RAS) and diabetic retinopathy alteration 
      score (DRAS), consisting of convolutional neural networks trained on EyePACS data 
      sets and fine-tuned using data sets of portable device fundus images. The ground 
      truth was the classification of DR corresponding to adjudicated expert reading, 
      performed by 3 certified ophthalmologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome 
      measures included the sensitivity and specificity of the AI system in detecting 
      DR and/or mtmDR using a single-field, macula-centered fundus photograph for each 
      eye, compared with a rigorous clinical reference standard comprising the reading 
      center grading of 2-field imaging protocol using the International Classification 
      of Diabetic Retinopathy severity scale. RESULTS: Of 327 analyzed patients (mean 
      age, 57.0 ± 16.8 years; mean diabetes duration, 16.3 ± 9.7 years), 307 completed 
      the study protocol. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI system were high in 
      detecting any DR with DRAS (sensitivity, 90.48% [95% confidence interval (CI), 
      84.99%-94.46%]; specificity, 90.65% [95% CI, 84.54%-94.93%]) and mtmDR with the 
      combination of RAS and DRAS (sensitivity, 90.23% [95% CI, 83.87%-94.69%]; 
      specificity, 85.06% [95% CI, 78.88%-90.00%]). The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve was 0.95 for any DR and 0.89 for mtmDR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high accuracy for the detection of DR in 
      different levels of severity with a single retinal photo per eye in an all-in-one 
      solution, composed of a portable retinal camera powered by AI. Such a strategy 
      holds great potential for increasing coverage rates of screening programs, 
      contributing to prevention of avoidable blindness. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: F.K.M.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the largest cause of 
      end-stage kidney disease. Early and accurate detection of DKD is beneficial for 
      patients. The present detection depends on the measurement of albuminuria or the 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is invasive and not optimal; 
      therefore, new detection tools are urgently needed. Meanwhile, a close 
      relationship between diabetic retinopathy and DKD has been reported; thus, we 
      aimed to develop a novel detection algorithm for DKD using artificial 
      intelligence technology based on retinal vascular parameters combined with 
      several easily available clinical parameters in patients with type-2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: A total of 515 consecutive patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus from 
      Xiangyang Central Hospital were included. Patients were stratified by DKD 
      diagnosis and split randomly into either the training set (70%, N = 360) or the 
      testing set (30%, N = 155) (random seed = 1). Data from the training set were 
      used to develop the machine learning algorithm (MLA), while those from the 
      testing set were used to validate the MLA. Model performances were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The MLA using the random forest classifier presented optimal performance 
      compared with other classifiers. When validated, the accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, F1 score, and AUC for the optimal model were 84.5%(95% CI 
      83.3-85.7), 84.5%(82.3-86.7), 84.5%(82.7-86.3), 0.845(0.831-0.859), and 
      0.914(0.903-0.925), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A new machine learning algorithm 
      for DKD diagnosis based on fundus images and 8 easily available clinical 
      parameters was developed, which indicated that retinal vascular changes can 
      assist in DKD screening and detection.

AB  - The capillary nonperfusion area (NPA) is a key quantifiable biomarker in the 
      evaluation of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using optical coherence tomography 
      angiography (OCTA). However, signal reduction artifacts caused by vitreous 
      floaters, pupil vignetting, or defocus present significant obstacles to accurate 
      quantification. We have developed a convolutional neural network, MEDnet-V2, to 
      distinguish NPA from signal reduction artifacts in 6×6 mm(2) OCTA. The network 
      achieves strong specificity and sensitivity for NPA detection across a wide range 
      of DR severity and scan quality.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Automated Segmentation and Hybrid Feature Analysis for 
      Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Using Fundus Image.
LID - 10.3390/e22050567 [doi]
LID - 567
AB  - The object of this study was to demonstrate the ability of machine learning (ML) 
      methods for the segmentation and classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      Two-dimensional (2D) retinal fundus (RF) images were used. The datasets of 
      DR-that is, the mild, moderate, non-proliferative, proliferative, and normal 
      human eye ones-were acquired from 500 patients at Bahawal Victoria Hospital 
      (BVH), Bahawalpur, Pakistan. Five hundred RF datasets (sized 256 × 256) for each 
      DR stage and a total of 2500 (500 × 5) datasets of the five DR stages were 
      acquired. This research introduces the novel clustering-based automated region 
      growing framework. For texture analysis, four types of features-histogram (H), 
      wavelet (W), co-occurrence matrix (COM) and run-length matrix (RLM)-were 
      extracted, and various ML classifiers were employed, achieving 77.67%, 80%, 
      89.87%, and 96.33% classification accuracies, respectively. To improve 
      classification accuracy, a fused hybrid-feature dataset was generated by applying 
      the data fusion approach. From each image, 245 pieces of hybrid feature data (H, 
      W, COM, and RLM) were observed, while 13 optimized features were selected after 
      applying four different feature selection techniques, namely Fisher, 
      correlation-based feature selection, mutual information, and probability of error 
      plus average correlation. Five ML classifiers named sequential minimal 
      optimization (SMO), logistic (Lg), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), logistic model 
      tree (LMT), and simple logistic (SLg) were deployed on selected optimized 
      features (using 10-fold cross-validation), and they showed considerably high 
      classification accuracies of 98.53%, 99%, 99.66%, 99.73%, and 99.73%, 
      respectively.

TI  - A Novel Computer-Aided Diagnostic System for Early Detection of Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Using 3D-OCT Higher-Order Spatial Appearance Model.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020461 [doi]
LID - 461
AB  - Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is of critical importance to 
      suppress severe damage to the retina and/or vision loss. In this study, an 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method is 
      proposed to detect DR early using structural 3D retinal scans. This system uses 
      prior shape knowledge to automatically segment all retinal layers of the 3D-OCT 
      scans using an adaptive, appearance-based method. After the segmentation step, 
      novel texture features are extracted from the segmented layers of the OCT B-scans 
      volume for DR diagnosis. For every layer, Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) model 
      is used to extract the 2nd-order reflectivity. In order to represent the 
      extracted image-derived features, we employ cumulative distribution function 
      (CDF) descriptors. For layer-wise classification in 3D volume, using the 
      extracted Gibbs energy feature, an artificial neural network (ANN) is fed the 
      extracted feature for every layer. Finally, the classification outputs for all 
      twelve layers are fused using a majority voting schema for global subject 
      diagnosis. A cohort of 188 3D-OCT subjects are used for system evaluation using 
      different k-fold validation techniques and different validation metrics. Accuracy 
      of 90.56%, 93.11%, and 96.88% are achieved using 4-, 5-, and 10-fold 
      cross-validation, respectively. Additional comparison with deep learning 
      networks, which represent the state-of-the-art, documented the promise of our 
      system's ability to diagnose the DR early.

AB  - Imbalanced classes and dimensional disasters are critical challenges in medical 
      image classification. As a classical machine learning model, the n-gram model has 
      shown excellent performance in addressing this issue in text classification. In 
      this study, we proposed an algorithm to classify medical images by extracting 
      their n-gram semantic features. This algorithm first converts an image 
      classification problem to a text classification problem by building an n-gram 
      corpus for an image. After that, the algorithm was based on the n-gram model to 
      classify images. The algorithm was evaluated by two independent public datasets. 
      The first experiment is to diagnose benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The 
      best area under the curve (AUC) is 0.989. The second experiment is to diagnose 
      the type of fundus lesion. The best result is that it correctly identified 
      86.667% of patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 93.333% of 
      patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), and 93.333% of normal individuals.

AB  - Timely and affordable computer-aided diagnosis of retinal diseases is pivotal in 
      precluding blindness. Accurate retinal vessel segmentation plays an important 
      role in disease progression and diagnosis of such vision-threatening diseases. To 
      this end, we propose a Multi-resolution Contextual Network (MRC-Net) that 
      addresses these issues by extracting multi-scale features to learn contextual 
      dependencies between semantically different features and using bi-directional 
      recurrent learning to model former-latter and latter-former dependencies. Another 
      key idea is training in adversarial settings for foreground segmentation 
      improvement through optimization of the region-based scores. This novel strategy 
      boosts the performance of the segmentation network in terms of the Dice score 
      (and correspondingly Jaccard index) while keeping the number of trainable 
      parameters comparatively low. We have evaluated our method on three benchmark 
      datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE, demonstrating its superior 
      performance as compared with competitive approaches elsewhere in the literature.

TI  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence Paves the Way in Precision Diagnostics and 
      Biomarker Discovery for the Subclass of Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetics.
LID - 10.3390/metabo13121204 [doi]
LID - 1204
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common ocular microvascular complication of 
      diabetes, contributes significantly to diabetes-related vision loss. This study 
      addresses the imperative need for early diagnosis of DR and precise treatment 
      strategies based on the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework. The 
      study integrated clinical, biochemical, and metabolomic biomarkers associated 
      with the following classes: non-DR (NDR), non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
      (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
      patients. To create machine learning (ML) models, 10% of the data was divided 
      into validation sets and 90% into discovery sets. The validation dataset was used 
      for hyperparameter optimization and feature selection stages, while the discovery 
      dataset was used to measure the performance of the models. A 10-fold 
      cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of ML models. 
      Biomarker discovery was performed using minimum redundancy maximum relevance 
      (mRMR), Boruta, and explainable boosting machine (EBM). The predictive proposed 
      framework compares the results of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), natural 
      gradient boosting for probabilistic prediction (NGBoost), and EBM models in 
      determining the DR subclass. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized 
      using Bayesian optimization. Combining EBM feature selection with XGBoost, the 
      optimal model achieved (91.25 ± 1.88) % accuracy, (89.33 ± 1.80) % precision, 
      (91.24 ± 1.67) % recall, (89.37 ± 1.52) % F1-Score, and (97.00 ± 0.25) % the area 
      under the ROC curve (AUROC). According to the EBM explanation, the six most 
      important biomarkers in determining the course of DR were tryptophan (Trp), 
      phosphatidylcholine diacyl C42:2 (PC.aa.C42.2), butyrylcarnitine (C4), tyrosine 
      (Tyr), hexadecanoyl carnitine (C16) and total dimethylarginine (DMA). The 
      identified biomarkers may provide a better understanding of the progression of 
      DR, paving the way for more precise and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment 
      strategies.

AB  - To assist ophthalmologists in diagnosing retinal abnormalities, Computer Aided 
      Diagnosis has played a significant role. In this paper, a particular 
      Convolutional Neural Network based on Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) is used 
      to detect one to four retinal abnormalities from Optical Coherence Tomography 
      (OCT) images. Predefined wavelet filters in this network decrease the computation 
      complexity and processing time compared to deep learning methods. We use two 
      layers of the WST network to obtain a direct and efficient model. WST generates a 
      sparse representation of the images which is translation-invariant and stable 
      concerning local deformations. Next, a Principal Component Analysis classifies 
      the extracted features. We evaluate the model using four publicly available 
      datasets to have a comprehensive comparison with the literature. The accuracies 
      of classifying the OCT images of the OCTID dataset into two and five classes were 
      [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. We achieved an 
      accuracy of [Formula: see text] in detecting Diabetic Macular Edema from Normal 
      ones using the TOPCON device-based dataset. Heidelberg and Duke datasets contain 
      DME, Age-related Macular Degeneration, and Normal classes, in which we achieved 
      accuracy of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. A 
      comparison of our results with the state-of-the-art models shows that our model 
      outperforms these models for some assessments or achieves nearly the best results 
      reported so far while having a much smaller computational complexity.

TI  - Teleophthalmology and Artificial Intelligence As Game Changers in Ophthalmic Care 
      After the COVID-19 Pandemic.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has boosted a sudden demand for telemedicine due to 
      quarantine and travel restrictions. The exponential increase in the use of 
      telemedicine is expected to affect ophthalmology drastically. The aim of this 
      review is to discuss the utility, effectiveness and challenges of 
      teleophthalmological new tools for eyecare delivery as well as its implementation 
      and possible facilitation with artificial intelligence. We used the terms: 
      "teleophthalmology," "telemedicine and COVID-19," "retinal diseases and 
      telemedicine," "virtual ophthalmology," "cost effectiveness of 
      teleophthalmology," "pediatric teleophthalmology," "Artificial intelligence and 
      ophthalmology," "Glaucoma and teleophthalmology" and "teleophthalmology 
      limitations" in the database of PubMed and selected the articles being published 
      in the course of 2015-2020. After the initial search, 321 articles returned as 
      relevant. A meticulous screening followed and eventually 103 published 
      manuscripts were included and used as our references. Emerging in the market, 
      teleophthalmology is showing great potential for the future of ophthalmological 
      care, benefiting both patients and ophthalmologists in times of pandemics. The 
      spectrum of eye diseases that could benefit from teleophthalmology is wide, 
      including mostly retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of 
      prematurity, age-related macular degeneration but also glaucoma and anterior 
      segment conditions. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence provides ways of 
      implementing teleophthalmology easier and with better outcomes, contributing as 
      significant changing factors for ophthalmology practice after the COVID-19 
      pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE: The effectiveness of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth 
      factor agents is usually lower in real world settings compared with randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs), often limiting the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in 
      regulatory and healthcare decisions. The current analysis aimed to develop and 
      validate an algorithm to explain the difference in outcomes between RWE studies 
      and RCTs in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: 
      The algorithm was developed using ranibizumab real world data (RWD) from the US 
      and validated on Australian and UK RWD. A decision model was developed using 
      machine learning principles, in which the model learns how to partition the most 
      influential factors (out of 59 variables) so that they maximally relate to the 
      change in visual acuity (VA) over 12 months. RESULTS: The algorithm identified 
      baseline VA <73 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, presence of 
      baseline subretinal fluid, and administration of three loading doses by Day 90 
      from drug initiation as the characteristics with the greatest impact on VA at 
      month 12. When applying the different criteria, RWE outcomes became similar to 
      those obtained in known RCTs. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques can be used 
      to classify real world cohorts and identify subsets of patients who benefit to 
      the same extent as that reported in RCTs. This methodology may support the 
      translation of clinical trial findings to treatment performance in the clinical 
      practice setting.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has been shown to be effective in developing diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) algorithms, possibly tackling financial and manpower challenges 
      hindering implementation of DR screening. However, our systematic review of the 
      literature reveals few studies studied the impact of different factors on these 
      DL algorithms, that are important for clinical deployment in real-world settings. 
      Using 455,491 retinal images, we evaluated two technical and three image-related 
      factors in detection of referable DR. For technical factors, the performances of 
      four DL models (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, Ensemble) and two computational 
      frameworks (Caffe, TensorFlow) were evaluated while for image-related factors, we 
      evaluated image compression levels (reducing image size, 350, 300, 250, 200, 
      150 KB), number of fields (7-field, 2-field, 1-field) and media clarity 
      (pseudophakic vs phakic). In detection of referable DR, four DL models showed 
      comparable diagnostic performance (AUC 0.936-0.944). To develop the VGGNet model, 
      two computational frameworks had similar AUC (0.936). The DL performance dropped 
      when image size decreased below 250 KB (AUC 0.936, 0.900, p < 0.001). The DL 
      performance performed better when there were increased number of fields (dataset 
      1: 2-field vs 1-field-AUC 0.936 vs 0.908, p < 0.001; dataset 2: 7-field vs 
      2-field vs 1-field, AUC 0.949 vs 0.911 vs 0.895). DL performed better in the 
      pseudophakic than phakic eyes (AUC 0.918 vs 0.833, p < 0.001). Various 
      image-related factors play more significant roles than technical factors in 
      determining the diagnostic performance, suggesting the importance of having 
      robust training and testing datasets for DL training and deployment in the 
      real-world settings.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation of Hyperreflective Foci in OCT Images Based on Lightweight 
      DBR Network.
PG  - 1148-1157
LID - 10.1007/s10278-023-00786-0 [doi]
AB  - Hyperreflective foci (HF) reflects inflammatory responses for fundus diseases 
      such as diabetic macular edema (DME), retina vein occlusion (RVO), and central 
      serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Shown as high contrast and reflectivity in 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, automatic segmentation of HF in OCT 
      images is helpful for the prognosis of fundus diseases. Previous traditional 
      methods were time-consuming and required high computing power. Hence, we proposed 
      a lightweight network to segment HF (with a speed of 57 ms per OCT image, at 
      least 150 ms faster than other methods). Our framework consists of two stages: an 
      NLM filter and patch-based split to preprocess images and a lightweight DBR 
      neural network to segment HF automatically. Experimental results from 3000 OCT 
      images of 300 patients (100 DME,100 RVO, and 100 CSC) revealed that our method 
      achieved HF segmentation successfully. The DBR network had the area under curves 
      dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 83.65%, 76.43%, and 82.20% in segmenting HF 
      in DME, RVO, and CSC on the test cohort respectively. Our DBR network achieves at 
      least 5% higher DSC than previous methods. HF in DME was more easily segmented 
      compared with the other two types. In addition, our DBR network is universally 
      applicable to clinical practice with the ability to segment HF in a wide range of 
      fundus diseases.

TI  - Clinician-Driven AI: Code-Free Self-Training on Public Data for Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Referral.
PG  - 1029-1036
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.4508 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Democratizing artificial intelligence (AI) enables model development 
      by clinicians with a lack of coding expertise, powerful computing resources, and 
      large, well-labeled data sets. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 
      resource-constrained clinicians can use self-training via automated machine 
      learning (ML) and public data sets to design high-performing diabetic retinopathy 
      classification models. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic quality 
      improvement study was conducted from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021. A 
      self-training method without coding was used on 2 public data sets with retinal 
      images from patients in France (Messidor-2 [n = 1748]) and the UK and US (EyePACS 
      [n = 58 689]) and externally validated on 1 data set with retinal images from 
      patients of a private Egyptian medical retina clinic (Egypt [n = 210]). An AI 
      model was trained to classify referable diabetic retinopathy as an exemplar use 
      case. Messidor-2 images were assigned adjudicated labels available on Kaggle; 4 
      images were deemed ungradable and excluded, leaving 1744 images. A total of 300 
      images randomly selected from the EyePACS data set were independently relabeled 
      by 3 blinded retina specialists using the International Classification of 
      Diabetic Retinopathy protocol for diabetic retinopathy grade and diabetic macular 
      edema presence; 19 images were deemed ungradable, leaving 281 images. Data 
      analysis was performed from February 1 to February 28, 2021. EXPOSURES: Using 
      public data sets, a teacher model was trained with labeled images using 
      supervised learning. Next, the resulting predictions, termed pseudolabels, were 
      used on an unlabeled public data set. Finally, a student model was trained with 
      the existing labeled images and the additional pseudolabeled images. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The analyzed metrics for the models included the area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and F1 score. The Fisher exact test was performed, and 2-tailed P 
      values were calculated for failure case analysis. RESULTS: For the internal 
      validation data sets, AUROC values for performance ranged from 0.886 to 0.939 for 
      the teacher model and from 0.916 to 0.951 for the student model. For external 
      validation of automated ML model performance, AUROC values and accuracy were 
      0.964 and 93.3% for the teacher model, 0.950 and 96.7% for the student model, and 
      0.890 and 94.3% for the manually coded bespoke model, respectively. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that self-training using automated ML is an 
      effective method to increase both model performance and generalizability while 
      decreasing the need for costly expert labeling. This approach advances the 
      democratization of AI by enabling clinicians without coding expertise or access 
      to large, well-labeled private data sets to develop their own AI models.

TI  - Deceptive Tricks in Artificial Intelligence: Adversarial Attacks in 
      Ophthalmology.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12093266 [doi]
LID - 3266
AB  - The artificial intelligence (AI) systems used for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases 
      have significantly progressed in recent years. The diagnosis of difficult eye 
      conditions, such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular 
      degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity, has become significantly 
      less complicated as a result of the development of AI algorithms, which are 
      currently on par with ophthalmologists in terms of their level of effectiveness. 
      However, in the context of building AI systems for medical applications such as 
      identifying eye diseases, addressing the challenges of safety and trustworthiness 
      is paramount, including the emerging threat of adversarial attacks. Research has 
      increasingly focused on understanding and mitigating these attacks, with numerous 
      articles discussing this topic in recent years. As a starting point for our 
      discussion, we used the paper by Ma et al. "Understanding Adversarial Attacks on 
      Deep Learning Based Medical Image Analysis Systems". A literature review was 
      performed for this study, which included a thorough search of open-access 
      research papers using online sources (PubMed and Google). The research provides 
      examples of unique attack strategies for medical images. Unfortunately, unique 
      algorithms for attacks on the various ophthalmic image types have yet to be 
      developed. It is a task that needs to be performed. As a result, it is necessary 
      to build algorithms that validate the computation and explain the findings of 
      artificial intelligence models. In this article, we focus on adversarial attacks, 
      one of the most well-known attack methods, which provide evidence (i.e., 
      adversarial examples) of the lack of resilience of decision models that do not 
      include provable guarantees. Adversarial attacks have the potential to provide 
      inaccurate findings in deep learning systems and can have catastrophic effects in 
      the healthcare industry, such as healthcare financing fraud and wrong diagnosis.

      variants in complex eye diseases.

LID - 10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100164 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of eye disorders have identified hundreds 
      of genetic variants associated with ocular disease. However, the vast majority of 
      these variants are noncoding, making it challenging to interpret their function. 
      Here we present a joint single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin 
      accessibility of the adult human retina with more than 50,000 cells, which we 
      used to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated by GWASs of 
      age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and 
      type 2 macular telangiectasia. We integrate this atlas with a HiChIP enhancer 
      connectome, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, and base-resolution 
      deep learning models to predict noncoding SNPs with causal roles in eye disease, 
      assess SNP impact on transcription factor binding, and define their known and 
      novel target genes. Our efforts nominate pathogenic SNP-target gene interactions 
      for multiple vision disorders and provide a potentially powerful resource for 
      interpreting noncoding variation in the eye.

AB  - Fluorescein angiography is a crucial examination in ophthalmology to identify 
      retinal and choroidal pathologies. However, this examination modality is invasive 
      and inconvenient, requiring intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye. In order 
      to provide a more convenient option for high-risk patients, we propose a 
      deep-learning-based method to translate fundus photography into fluorescein 
      angiography using Energy-based Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleEBGAN) 
      We propose a deep-learning-based method to translate fundus photography into 
      fluorescein angiography using CycleEBGAN. We collected fundus photographs and 
      fluorescein angiographs taken at Changwon Gyeongsang National University Hospital 
      between January 2016 and June 2021 and paired late-phase fluorescein angiographs 
      and fundus photographs taken on the same day. We developed CycleEBGAN, a 
      combination of cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) and Energy-based 
      Generative Adversarial Networks (EBGAN), to translate the paired images. The 
      simulated images were then interpreted by 2 retinal specialists to determine 
      their clinical consistency with fluorescein angiography. A retrospective study. A 
      total of 2605 image pairs were obtained, with 2555 used as the training set and 
      the remaining 50 used as the test set. Both CycleGAN and CycleEBGAN effectively 
      translated fundus photographs into fluorescein angiographs. However, CycleEBGAN 
      showed superior results to CycleGAN in translating subtle abnormal features. We 
      propose CycleEBGAN as a method for generating fluorescein angiography using cheap 
      and convenient fundus photography. Synthetic fluorescein angiography with 
      CycleEBGAN was more accurate than fundus photography, making it a helpful option 
      for high-risk patients requiring fluorescein angiography, such as diabetic 
      retinopathy patients with nephropathy.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a progressive disease, and its detection at an early 
      stage is crucial for saving a patient's vision. An automated screening system for 
      DR can help in reduce the chances of complete blindness due to DR along with 
      lowering the work load on ophthalmologists. Among the earliest signs of DR are 
      microaneurysms (MAs). However, current schemes for MA detection appear to report 
      many false positives because detection algorithms have high sensitivity. 
      Inevitably some non-MAs structures are labeled as MAs in the initial MAs 
      identification step. This is a typical "class imbalance problem". Class 
      imbalanced data has detrimental effects on the performance of conventional 
      classifiers. In this work, we propose an ensemble based adaptive over-sampling 
      algorithm for overcoming the class imbalance problem in the false positive 
      reduction, and we use Boosting, Bagging, Random subspace as the ensemble 
      framework to improve microaneurysm detection. The ensemble based over-sampling 
      methods we proposed combine the strength of adaptive over-sampling and ensemble. 
      The objective of the amalgamation of ensemble and adaptive over-sampling is to 
      reduce the induction biases introduced from imbalanced data and to enhance the 
      generalization classification performance of extreme learning machines (ELM). 
      Experimental results show that our ASOBoost method has higher area under the ROC 
      curve (AUC) and G-mean values than many existing class imbalance learning 
      methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning (DL) models 
      for automatically detecting the ischemia type and the non-perfusion area (NPA) 
      from color fundus photographs (CFPs) of patients with branch retinal vein 
      occlusion (BRVO). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 274 CFPs from 
      patients diagnosed with BRVO. All DL models were trained using a deep 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) based on 45 degree CFPs covering the fovea and 
      the optic disk. We first trained a DL algorithm to identify BRVO patients with or 
      without the necessity of retinal photocoagulation from 219 CFPs and validated the 
      algorithm on 55 CFPs. Next, we trained another DL algorithm to segment NPA from 
      104 CFPs and validated it on 29 CFPs, in which the NPA was manually delineated by 
      3 experienced ophthalmologists according to fundus fluorescein angiography. Both 
      DL models have been cross-validated 5-fold. The recall, precision, accuracy, and 
      area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the DL models in comparison with 
      three types of independent ophthalmologists of different seniority. RESULTS: In 
      the first DL model, the recall, precision, accuracy, and area under the curve 
      (AUC) were 0.75 ± 0.08, 0.80 ± 0.07, 0.79 ± 0.02, and 0.82 ± 0.03, respectively, 
      for predicting the necessity of laser photocoagulation for BRVO CFPs. The second 
      DL model was able to segment NPA in CFPs of BRVO with an AUC of 0.96 ± 0.02. The 
      recall, precision, and accuracy for segmenting NPA was 0.74 ± 0.05, 0.87 ± 0.02, 
      and 0.89 ± 0.02, respectively. The performance of the second DL model was nearly 
      comparable with the senior doctors and significantly better than the residents. 
      CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the DL models can directly identify and 
      segment retinal NPA from the CFPs of patients with BRVO, which can further guide 
      laser photocoagulation. Further research is needed to identify NPA of the 
      peripheral retina in BRVO, or other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Microaneurysms detection in color fundus images using machine learning based on 
      directional local contrast.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As one of the major complications of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness due to delayed 
      diagnosis and intervention. Microaneurysms appear as the earliest symptom of DR. 
      Accurate and reliable detection of microaneurysms in color fundus images has 
      great importance for DR screening. METHODS: A microaneurysms' detection method 
      using machine learning based on directional local contrast (DLC) is proposed for 
      the early diagnosis of DR. First, blood vessels were enhanced and segmented using 
      improved enhancement function based on analyzing eigenvalues of Hessian matrix. 
      Next, with blood vessels excluded, microaneurysm candidate regions were obtained 
      using shape characteristics and connected components analysis. After image 
      segmented to patches, the features of each microaneurysm candidate patch were 
      extracted, and each candidate patch was classified into microaneurysm or 
      non-microaneurysm. The main contributions of our study are (1) making use of 
      directional local contrast in microaneurysms' detection for the first time, which 
      does make sense for better microaneurysms' classification. (2) Applying three 
      different machine learning techniques for classification and comparing their 
      performance for microaneurysms' detection. The proposed algorithm was trained and 
      tested on e-ophtha MA database, and further tested on another independent 
      DIARETDB1 database. Results of microaneurysms' detection on the two databases 
      were evaluated on lesion level and compared with existing algorithms. RESULTS: 
      The proposed method has achieved better performance compared with existing 
      algorithms on accuracy and computation time. On e-ophtha MA and DIARETDB1 
      databases, the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve was 0.87 and 0.86, respectively. The free-response ROC (FROC) score on the 
      two databases was 0.374 and 0.210, respectively. The computation time per image 
      with resolution of 2544×1969, 1400×960 and 1500×1152 is 29 s, 3 s and 2.6 s, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method using machine learning based on 
      directional local contrast of image patches can effectively detect microaneurysms 
      in color fundus images and provide an effective scientific basis for early 
      clinical DR diagnosis.

TI  - A Multitask Deep-Learning System to Classify Diabetic Macular Edema for Different 
      Optical Coherence Tomography Devices: A Multicenter Analysis.
PG  - 2078-2088
LID - 10.2337/dc20-3064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the primary cause of vision loss among 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). We developed, validated, and tested a 
      deep learning (DL) system for classifying DME using images from three common 
      commercially available optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and validated two versions of a multitask 
      convolution neural network (CNN) to classify DME (center-involved DME [CI-DME], 
      non-CI-DME, or absence of DME) using three-dimensional (3D) volume scans and 2D 
      B-scans, respectively. For both 3D and 2D CNNs, we used the residual network 
      (ResNet) as the backbone. For the 3D CNN, we used a 3D version of ResNet-34 with 
      the last fully connected layer removed as the feature extraction module. A total 
      of 73,746 OCT images were used for training and primary validation. External 
      testing was performed using 26,981 images across seven independent data sets from 
      Singapore, Hong Kong, the U.S., China, and Australia. RESULTS: In classifying the 
      presence or absence of DME, the DL system achieved area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.937 (95% CI 0.920-0.954), 0.958 
      (0.930-0.977), and 0.965 (0.948-0.977) for the primary data set obtained from 
      CIRRUS, SPECTRALIS, and Triton OCTs, respectively, in addition to AUROCs >0.906 
      for the external data sets. For further classification of the CI-DME and 
      non-CI-DME subgroups, the AUROCs were 0.968 (0.940-0.995), 0.951 (0.898-0.982), 
      and 0.975 (0.947-0.991) for the primary data set and >0.894 for the external data 
      sets. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated excellent performance with a DL system for the 
      automated classification of DME, highlighting its potential as a promising 
      second-line screening tool for patients with DM, which may potentially create a 
      more effective triaging mechanism to eye clinics.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of the present study is to develop fast automated 
      quantification of retinal fluid in optical coherence tomography (OCT) image 
      sets.MethodsWe developed an image analysis pipeline tailored towards OCT images 
      that consists of five steps for binary retinal fluid segmentation. The method is 
      based on feature extraction, pre-segmention, dimension reduction procedures, and 
      supervised learning tools.ResultsFluid identification using our pipeline was 
      tested on two separate patient groups: one associated to neovascular age-related 
      macular degeneration, the other showing diabetic macular edema. For training and 
      evaluation purposes, retinal fluid was annotated manually in each cross-section 
      by human expert graders of the Vienna Reading Center. Compared with the manual 
      annotations, our pipeline yields good quantification, visually and in 
      numbers.ConclusionsBy demonstrating good automated retinal fluid quantification, 
      our pipeline appears useful to expert graders within their current grading 
      processes. Owing to dimension reduction, the actual learning part is fast and 
      requires only few training samples. Hence, it is well-suited for integration into 
      actual manufacturer's devices, further improving segmentation by its use in daily 
      clinical life.

AB  - The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications 
      technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology 
      to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital 
      innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th 
      generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), 
      creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new 
      models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. 
      Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many 
      image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to 
      challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This 
      article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital 
      innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, 
      age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract 
      and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital 
      strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may 
      increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. 
      Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating 
      containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of 
      eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic 
      services adapt and form a "new normal", the rapid adoption of some of telehealth 
      and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges 
      for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as 
      recommendations on future directions.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a kind of ocular complication of diabetes, and its 
      degree grade is an essential basis for early diagnosis of patients. Manual 
      diagnosis is a long and expensive process with a specific risk of misdiagnosis. 
      Computer-aided diagnosis can provide more accurate and practical treatment 
      recommendations. In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint learning DR 
      diagnostic model called RT2Net, which integrates the global features of fundus 
      images and the local detailed features of vascular images to reduce the 
      limitations of single fundus image learning. Firstly, the original image is 
      preprocessed using operations such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram 
      equalization, and the vascular structure of the extracted DR image is segmented. 
      Then, the vascular image and fundus image are input into two branch networks of 
      RT2Net for feature extraction, respectively, and the feature fusion module 
      adaptively fuses the feature vectors' output from the branch networks. Finally, 
      the optimized classification model is used to identify the five categories of DR. 
      This paper conducts extensive experiments on the public datasets EyePACS and 
      APTOS 2019 to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. The accuracy of RT2Net on 
      the two datasets reaches 88.2% and 85.4%, and the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. The 
      excellent classification ability of RT2Net for DR can significantly help patients 
      detect and treat lesions early and provide doctors with a more reliable diagnosis 
      basis, which has significant clinical value for diagnosing DR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of legal blindness in 
      the working population in developed countries. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      angiography (OCTA) has risen as an essential tool in the diagnosis and control of 
      diabetic patients, with and without DR, allowing visualisation of the retinal and 
      choroidal microvasculature, their qualitative and quantitative changes, the 
      progression of vascular disease, quantification of ischaemic areas, and the 
      detection of preclinical changes. The aim of this article is to analyse the 
      current applications of OCTA and provide an updated overview of them in the 
      evaluation of DR. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed 
      and Embase, including the keywords "OCTA" OR "OCT angiography" OR "optical 
      coherence tomography angiography" AND "diabetes" OR "diabetes mellitus" OR 
      "diabetic retinopathy" OR "diabetic maculopathy" OR "diabetic macular oedema" OR 
      "diabetic macular ischaemia". Of the 1456 studies initially identified, 107 
      studies were screened after duplication, and those articles that did not meet the 
      selection criteria were removed. Finally, after looking for missing data, we 
      included 135 studies in this review. RESULTS: We present the common and 
      distinctive findings in the analysed papers after the literature search including 
      the diagnostic use of OCTA in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. We describe 
      previous findings in retinal vascularization, including microaneurysms, foveal 
      avascular zone (FAZ) changes in both size and morphology, changes in vascular 
      perfusion, the appearance of retinal microvascular abnormalities or new vessels, 
      and diabetic macular oedema (DME) and the use of deep learning technology applied 
      to this disease. CONCLUSION: OCTA findings enable the diagnosis and follow-up of 
      DM patients, including those with no detectable lesions with other devices. The 
      evaluation of retinal and choroidal plexuses using OCTA is a fundamental tool for 
      the diagnosis and prognosis of DR.

TI  - Impact of sarcosine on diabetic retinopathy: Findings based on weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis and machine learning techniques.
PG  - 3501-3511

AB  - AIM: To quantify the association between serum sarcosine and diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). METHODS: We 
      measured serum metabolites in 69 pairs of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with and 
      without DR matched by age, gender, body mass index（BMI and HbA1c, using a 
      propensity score matching-based approach. To identify modules and metabolites 
      linked to DR, pathway analysis was performed using WGCNA, the Kyoto Encyclopedia 
      of Genes and Genomes and Small-Molecule Pathway Database. The association of 
      sarcosine with DR was estimated by restricted cubic spline and conditional 
      logistic regression models. Its joint effects with covariates on DR were also 
      extensively examined. RESULTS: With per interquartile range elevation of 
      sarcosine, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of DR significantly decreased by 67% 
      (AOR: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.58). Similar results were also 
      found in the tertile analysis. Compared with those in the first tertile of 
      sarcosine, the AOR significantly decreased by 54% (AOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.18-1.17) 
      and 78% (AOR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.59) for subjects in the second and third 
      tertiles, respectively. Compared with subjects with lower sarcosine and lower 
      HDL-C levels, those with higher sarcosine and lower HDL-C levels had the lowest 
      odds of DR (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Serum sarcosine was 
      inversely related to DR, especially in T2D patients with insufficient HDL-C. This 
      study provides insights on a possible novel target for DR precision prevention 
      and control, as well as a better understanding of the DR mechanism.

TI  - Intraretinal Hyper-Reflective Foci Are Almost Universally Present and Co-Localize 
      With Intraretinal Fluid in Diabetic Macular Edema.

AB  - PURPOSE: In diabetic macular edema (DME), hyper-reflective foci (HRF) has been 
      linked to disease severity and progression. Using an automated approach, we aimed 
      to investigate the baseline distribution of HRF in DME and their co-localization 
      with cystoid intraretinal fluid (IRF). METHODS: Baseline spectral-domain optical 
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (N = 1527) from phase III clinical 
      trials YOSEMITE (NCT03622580) and RHINE (NCT03622593) were segmented using a 
      deep-learning-based algorithm (developed using B-scans from BOULEVARD 
      NCT02699450) to detect HRF. The HRF count and volume were assessed. HRF 
      distributions were analyzed in relation to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), 
      central subfield thickness (CST), and IRF volume in quartiles, and Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Severity Scores (DRSS) in groups. Co-localization of HRF with IRF was 
      calculated in the central 3-mm diameter using the en face projection. RESULTS: 
      HRF were present in most patients (up to 99.7%). Median (interquartile range 
      [IQR]) HRF volume within the 3-mm diameter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
      Study ring was 1964.3 (3325.2) pL, and median count was 64.0 (IQR = 96.0). Median 
      HRF volumes were greater with decreasing BCVA (nominal P = 0.0109), and 
      increasing CST (nominal P < 0.0001), IRF (nominal P < 0.0001), and DRSS up to 
      very severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (nominal P < 0.0001). HRF 
      co-localized with IRF in the en face projection. CONCLUSIONS: Using automated HRF 
      segmentation of full SD-OCT volumes, we observed that HRF are a ubiquitous 
      feature in DME and exhibit relationships with BCVA, CST, IRF, and DRSS, 
      supporting a potential link to disease severity. The spatial distribution of HRF 
      closely followed that of IRF.

TI  - An Automated Grading System for Detection of Vision-Threatening Referable 
      Diabetic Retinopathy on the Basis of Color Fundus Photographs.
PG  - 2509-2516
LID - 10.2337/dc18-0147 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to describe the development and validation 
      of an artificial intelligence-based, deep learning algorithm (DLA) for the 
      detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (DR). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 
      DLA using a convolutional neural network was developed for automated detection of 
      vision-threatening referable DR (preproliferative DR or worse, diabetic macular 
      edema, or both). The DLA was tested by using a set of 106,244 nonstereoscopic 
      retinal images. A panel of ophthalmologists graded DR severity in retinal 
      photographs included in the development and internal validation data sets (n = 
      71,043); a reference standard grading was assigned once three graders achieved 
      consistent grading outcomes. For external validation, we tested our DLA using 
      35,201 images of 14,520 eyes (904 eyes with any DR; 401 eyes with 
      vision-threatening referable DR) from population-based cohorts of Malays, 
      Caucasian Australians, and Indigenous Australians. RESULTS: Among the 71,043 
      retinal images in the training and validation data sets, 12,329 showed 
      vision-threatening referable DR. In the internal validation data set, the area 
      under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the DLA for 
      vision-threatening referable DR were 0.989, 97.0%, and 91.4%, respectively. 
      Testing against the independent, multiethnic data set achieved an AUC, 
      sensitivity, and specificity of 0.955, 92.5%, and 98.5%, respectively. Among 
      false-positive cases, 85.6% were due to a misclassification of mild or moderate 
      DR. Undetected intraretinal microvascular abnormalities accounted for 77.3% of 
      all false-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: This artificial intelligence-based DLA can 
      be used with high accuracy in the detection of vision-threatening referable DR in 
      retinal images. This technology offers potential to increase the efficiency and 
      accessibility of DR screening programs.

TI  - Predicting Systemic Health Features from Retinal Fundus Images Using 
      Transfer-Learning-Based Artificial Intelligence Models.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071714 [doi]
LID - 1714
AB  - While color fundus photos are used in routine clinical practice to diagnose 
      ophthalmic conditions, evidence suggests that ocular imaging contains valuable 
      information regarding the systemic health features of patients. These features 
      can be identified through computer vision techniques including deep learning (DL) 
      artificial intelligence (AI) models. We aim to construct a DL model that can 
      predict systemic features from fundus images and to determine the optimal method 
      of model construction for this task. Data were collected from a cohort of 
      patients undergoing diabetic retinopathy screening between March 2020 and March 
      2021. Two models were created for each of 12 systemic health features based on 
      the DenseNet201 architecture: one utilizing transfer learning with images from 
      ImageNet and another from 35,126 fundus images. Here, 1277 fundus images were 
      used to train the AI models. Area under the receiver operating characteristics 
      curve (AUROC) scores were used to compare the model performance. Models utilizing 
      the ImageNet transfer learning data were superior to those using retinal images 
      for transfer learning (mean AUROC 0.78 vs. 0.65, p-value < 0.001). Models using 
      ImageNet pretraining were able to predict systemic features including ethnicity 
      (AUROC 0.93), age > 70 (AUROC 0.90), gender (AUROC 0.85), ACE inhibitor (AUROC 
      0.82), and ARB medication use (AUROC 0.78). We conclude that fundus images 
      contain valuable information about the systemic characteristics of a patient. To 
      optimize DL model performance, we recommend that even domain specific models 
      consider using transfer learning from more generalized image sets to improve 
      accuracy.

TI  - Diabetic and Hypertensive Retinopathy Screening in Fundus Images Using 
      Artificially Intelligent Shallow Architectures.

LID - 7
AB  - Retinal blood vessels are considered valuable biomarkers for the detection of 
      diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and other retinal disorders. 
      Ophthalmologists analyze retinal vasculature by manual segmentation, which is a 
      tedious task. Numerous studies have focused on automatic retinal vasculature 
      segmentation using different methods for ophthalmic disease analysis. However, 
      most of these methods are computationally expensive and lack robustness. This 
      paper proposes two new shallow deep learning architectures: dual-stream fusion 
      network (DSF-Net) and dual-stream aggregation network (DSA-Net) to accurately 
      detect retinal vasculature. The proposed method uses semantic segmentation in raw 
      color fundus images for the screening of diabetic and hypertensive retinopathies. 
      The proposed method's performance is assessed using three publicly available 
      fundus image datasets: Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), 
      Structured Analysis of Retina (STARE), and Children Heart Health Study in England 
      Database (CHASE-DB1). The experimental results revealed that the proposed method 
      provided superior segmentation performance with accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (SE), 
      specificity (SP), and area under the curve (AUC) of 96.93%, 82.68%, 98.30%, and 
      98.42% for DRIVE, 97.25%, 82.22%, 98.38%, and 98.15% for CHASE-DB1, and 97.00%, 
      86.07%, 98.00%, and 98.65% for STARE datasets, respectively. The experimental 
      results also show that the proposed DSA-Net provides higher SE compared to the 
      existing approaches. It means that the proposed method detected the minor vessels 
      and provided the least false negatives, which is extremely important for 
      diagnosis. The proposed method provides an automatic and accurate segmentation 
      mask that can be used to highlight the vessel pixels. This detected vasculature 
      can be utilized to compute the ratio between the vessel and the non-vessel pixels 
      and distinguish between diabetic and hypertensive retinopathies, and morphology 
      can be analyzed for related retinal disorders.

TI  - An Automatic Detection and Classification System of Five Stages for Hypertensive 
      Retinopathy Using Semantic and Instance Segmentation in DenseNet Architecture.
LID - 10.3390/s21206936 [doi]
LID - 6936
AB  - The stage and duration of hypertension are connected to the occurrence of 
      Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR) of eye disease. Currently, a few computerized 
      systems have been developed to recognize HR by using only two stages. It is 
      difficult to define specialized features to recognize five grades of HR. In 
      addition, deep features have been used in the past, but the classification 
      accuracy is not up-to-the-mark. In this research, a new hypertensive retinopathy 
      (HYPER-RETINO) framework is developed to grade the HR based on five grades. The 
      HYPER-RETINO system is implemented based on pre-trained HR-related lesions. To 
      develop this HYPER-RETINO system, several steps are implemented such as a 
      preprocessing, the detection of HR-related lesions by semantic and instance-based 
      segmentation and a DenseNet architecture to classify the stages of HR. Overall, 
      the HYPER-RETINO system determined the local regions within input retinal fundus 
      images to recognize five grades of HR. On average, a 10-fold cross-validation 
      test obtained sensitivity (SE) of 90.5%, specificity (SP) of 91.5%, accuracy 
      (ACC) of 92.6%, precision (PR) of 91.7%, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) 
      of 61%, F1-score of 92% and area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.915 on 1400 HR 
      images. Thus, the applicability of the HYPER-RETINO method to reliably diagnose 
      stages of HR is verified by experimental findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in the field of retina. 
      The purpose of this study was to analyze the study trends within AI in retina by 
      reporting on publication trends, to identify journals, countries, authors, 
      international collaborations, and keywords involved in AI in retina. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Bibliometric methods were used to evaluate 
      global production and development trends in AI in retina since 2012 using Web of 
      Science Core Collection. RESULTS: A total of 599 publications were retrieved 
      ultimately. We found that AI in retina is a very attractive topic in scientific 
      and medical community. No journal was found to specialize in AI in retina. The 
      USA, China, and India were the three most productive countries. Authors from 
      Austria, Singapore, and England also had worldwide academic influence. China has 
      shown the greatest rapid increase in publication numbers. International 
      collaboration could increase influence in this field. Keywords revealed that 
      diabetic retinopathy, optical coherence tomography on multiple diseases, 
      algorithm were three popular topics in the field. Most of top journals and top 
      publication on AI in retina were mainly focused on engineering and computing, 
      rather than medicine. CONCLUSION: These results helped clarify the current status 
      and future trends in researches of AI in retina. This study may be useful for 
      clinicians and scientists to have a general overview of this field, and better 
      understand the main actors in this field (including authors, journals, and 
      countries). Researches are supposed to focus on more retinal diseases, multiple 
      modal imaging, and performance of AI models in real-world clinical application. 
      Collaboration among countries and institutions is common in current research of 
      AI in retina.

AB  - PURPOSE: The currently used measures of retinal function are limited by being 
      subjective, nonlocalized, or taxing for patients. To address these limitations, 
      we sought to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL) method to automatically 
      predict the functional end point (retinal sensitivity) based on structural OCT 
      images. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: In total, 714 
      volumes of 289 patients were used in this study. METHODS: A DL algorithm was 
      developed to automatically predict a comprehensive retinal sensitivity map from 
      an OCT volume. Four hundred sixty-three spectral-domain OCT volumes from 174 
      patients and their corresponding microperimetry examinations (Nidek MP-1) were 
      used for development and internal validation, with a total of 15 563 retinal 
      sensitivity measurements. The patients presented with a healthy macula, early or 
      intermediate age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, or 
      geographic atrophy. In addition, an external validation was performed using 251 
      volumes of 115 patients, comprising 3 different patient populations: those with 
      diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, or epiretinal membrane. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the performance of the algorithm using the mean 
      absolute error (MAE), limits of agreement (LoA), and correlation coefficients of 
      point-wise sensitivity (PWS) and mean sensitivity (MS). RESULTS: The algorithm 
      achieved an MAE of 2.34 dB and 1.30 dB, an LoA of 5.70 and 3.07, a Pearson 
      correlation coefficient of 0.66 and 0.84, and a Spearman correlation coefficient 
      of 0.68 and 0.83 for PWS and MS, respectively. In the external test set, the 
      method achieved an MAE of 2.73 dB and 1.66 dB for PWS and MS, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach allows the prediction of retinal function at 
      each measured location directly based on an OCT scan, demonstrating how 
      structural imaging can serve as a surrogate of visual function. Prospectively, 
      the approach may help to complement retinal function measures, explore the 
      association between image-based information and retinal functionality, improve 
      disease progression monitoring, and provide objective surrogate measures for 
      future clinical trials.

TI  - Characterization of Ultra-Widefield Angiographic Vascular Features in Diabetic 
      Retinopathy with Automated Severity Classification.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity 
      and quantitative retinal vascular features. DESIGN: Retrospective image analysis 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Eyes with DR and eyes with no posterior segment disease 
      (normal eyes) that had undergone ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) 
      with associated color fundus photography. Exclusion criteria were any previous 
      laser photocoagulation, low image quality, intravitreal or periocular 
      pharmacotherapy within 6 months of imaging, and any other significant retinal 
      disease including posterior uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, and choroidal 
      neovascularization. METHODS: The centered early mid-phase UWFA frame that 
      captured the maximum vessel area was selected using automated custom software for 
      each eye. Panretinal and zonal vascular features were extracted using a machine 
      learning algorithm. Eyes with DR were graded for DR severity as mild 
      nonproliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and proliferative DR 
      (PDR). Parameters of normal eyes were compared with age- and gender-matched 
      patients with DR using the t test. Differences between severity groups were 
      evaluated by the analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests, generalized 
      linear mixed-effects models, and random forest regression models. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Diabetic retinopathy severity and vascular features (panretinal and 
      zonal vessel area, length and geodesic distance, panretinal area index, 
      tortuosity measures, vascular density measures, and zero vessel density rate). 
      RESULTS: Ninety-seven eyes from 60 patients with DR and 12 normal eyes from 12 
      patients that underwent UWFA for evaluation of fellow eye pathology had images of 
      sufficient quality to be included in this analysis. The mean age was 60 ± 10 
      years in DR eyes and 46 ± 17 years in normal eyes. Panretinal vessel area, mean 
      geodesic distance, skewness, and kurtosis of local vessel density was 
      significantly higher in normal eyes compared with the age- and gender-matched 
      eyes with DR (P < 0.05). Zero vessel density rate, skewness of vessel density, 
      and mean mid-peripheral geodesic distance were among the most important features 
      for distinguishing mild NPDR from advanced forms of DR and PDR versus eyes 
      without PDR. CONCLUSIONS: Automated analysis of retinal vasculature demonstrated 
      associations with DR severity and visual and subvisual vascular biomarkers. 
      Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these 
      parameters for DR prognosis and therapeutic response.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a subset of AI, are 
      increasingly used in medicine. AI excels at performing well-defined tasks, such 
      as image recognition; for example, classifying skin biopsy lesions, determining 
      diabetic retinopathy severity, and detecting brain tumors. This article provides 
      an overview of the use of AI in medicine and particularly in respiratory 
      medicine, where it is used to evaluate lung cancer images, diagnose fibrotic lung 
      disease, and more recently is being developed to aid the interpretation of 
      pulmonary function tests and the diagnosis of a range of obstructive and 
      restrictive lung diseases. The development and validation of AI algorithms 
      requires large volumes of well-structured data, and the algorithms must work with 
      variable levels of data quality. It is important that clinicians understand how 
      AI can function in the context of heterogeneous conditions such as asthma and 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where diagnostic criteria overlap, how AI 
      use fits into everyday clinical practice, and how issues of patient safety should 
      be addressed. AI has a clear role in providing support for doctors in the 
      clinical workplace, but its relatively recent introduction means that confidence 
      in its use still has to be fully established. Overall, AI is expected to play a 
      key role in aiding clinicians in the diagnosis and management of respiratory 
      diseases in the future, and it will be exciting to see the benefits that arise 
      for patients and doctors from its use in everyday clinical practice.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation and Measurement of Choroid Layer in High Myopia for OCT 
      Imaging Using Deep Learning.
PG  - 1153-1163
LID - 10.1007/s10278-021-00571-x [doi]
AB  - Automatic segmentation and measurement of the choroid layer is useful in studying 
      of related fundus diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and high myopia. 
      However, most algorithms are not helpful for choroid layer segmentation due to 
      its blurred boundaries and complex gradients. Therefore, this paper aimed to 
      propose a novel choroid segmentation method that combines image enhancement and 
      attention-based dense (AD) U-Net network. The choroidal images obtained from 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) are pre-enhanced by algorithms that include 
      flattening, filtering, and exponential and linear enhancement to reduce 
      choroid-independent information. Experimental results obtained from 800 OCT 
      B-scans of the choroid layers from both normal eyes and high myopia showed that 
      image enhancement significantly increased the performance of ADU-Net, with an AUC 
      of 99.51% and a DSC of 97.91%. The accuracy of segmentation using the ADU-Net 
      method with image enhancement is superior to that of the existing networks. In 
      addition, we describe some algorithms that can measure automatically choroidal 
      foveal thickness and the volume of adjacent areas. Statistical analyses of the 
      choroidal parameters variation indicated that compared with normal eyes, high 
      myopia has a reduction of 86.3% of the choroidal foveal thickness and 90% of the 
      adjacent volume. It proved that high myopia is likely to cause choroid layer 
      attenuation. These algorithms would have wide application in the diagnosis and 
      precaution of related fundus lesions caused by choroid thinning from high myopia 
      in future studies.

TI  - Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Risk of Hard-to-Heal Diabetic Foot 
      Ulcers in a Chinese Population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of hard-to-heal diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is vital 
      to prevent a poor prognosis. The purpose of this work was to employ clinical 
      characteristics to create an optimal predictive model of hard-to-heal DFUs 
      (failing to decrease by >50% at 4 weeks) based on machine learning algorithms. 
      METHODS: A total of 362 DFU patients hospitalized in two tertiary hospitals in 
      eastern China were enrolled in this study. The training dataset and validation 
      dataset were split at a ratio of 7:3. Univariate logistic analysis and clinical 
      experience were utilized to screen clinical characteristics as predictive 
      features. The following six machine learning algorithms were used to build 
      prediction models for differentiating hard-to-heal DFUs: support vector machine, 
      the naïve Bayesian (NB) model, k-nearest neighbor, general linear regression, 
      adaptive boosting, and random forest. Five cross-validations were employed to 
      realize the model's parameters. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, and AUCs 
      were utilized to compare and evaluate the models' efficacy. On the basis of the 
      best model identified, the significance of each characteristic was evaluated, and 
      then an online calculator was developed. RESULTS: Independent predictors for 
      model establishment included sex, insulin use, random blood glucose, wound area, 
      diabetic retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, smoking history, serum 
      albumin, serum creatinine, and C-reactive protein. After evaluation, the NB model 
      was identified as the most generalizable model, with an AUC of 0.864, a recall of 
      0.907, and an F1-score of 0.744. Random blood glucose, C-reactive protein, and 
      wound area were determined to be the three most important influencing factors. A 
      corresponding online calculator was created 
      (https://predicthardtoheal.azurewebsites.net/). CONCLUSION: Based on clinical 
      characteristics, machine learning algorithms can achieve acceptable predictions 
      of hard-to-heal DFUs, with the NB model performing the best. Our online 
      calculator can assist doctors in identifying the possibility of hard-to-heal DFUs 
      at the time of admission to reduce the likelihood of a dismal prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) complicated with 
      renal diseases has not been fully understood in clinical practice. The purpose of 
      the study was to propose potential predictive factors to identify diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD), nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD), and DKD superimposed on NDKD 
      (DKD + NDKD) in T2DM patients noninvasively and accurately. METHODS: Two hundred 
      forty-one eligible patients confirmed by renal biopsy were enrolled in this 
      retrospective, analytical study. The features composed of clinical and 
      biochemical data prior to renal biopsy were extracted from patients' electronic 
      medical records. Machine learning algorithms were used to distinguish among 
      different kidney diseases pairwise. Feature variables selected in the developed 
      model were evaluated. RESULTS: Logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 
      0.8306 ± 0.0057 for DKD and NDKD classification. Hematocrit, diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR), hematuria, platelet distribution width and history of hypertension were 
      identified as important risk factors. Then SVM model allowed us to differentiate 
      NDKD from DKD + NDKD with accuracy 0.8686 ± 0.052 where hematuria, diabetes 
      duration, international normalized ratio (INR), D-Dimer, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol were the top risk factors. Finally, the logistic regression model 
      indicated that DD-dimer, hematuria, INR, systolic pressure, DR were likely to be 
      predictive factors to identify DKD with DKD + NDKD. CONCLUSION: Predictive 
      factors were successfully identified among different renal diseases in type 2 
      diabetes patients via machine learning methods. More attention should be paid on 
      the coagulation factors in the DKD + NDKD patients, which might indicate a 
      hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of thrombosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Retinal diseases are becoming a major health problem in 
      recent years. Their early detection and ensuing treatment are essential to 
      prevent visual damage, as the number of people affected by diabetes is expected 
      to grow exponentially. Retinal diseases progress slowly, without any discernible 
      symptoms. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a diagnostic tool capable of 
      analyzing and identifying the quantitative discrimination in the disease affected 
      retinal layers with high resolution. This paper proposes a deep neural 
      network-based classifier for the computer-aided classification of Diabetic 
      Macular Edema (DME), drusen, Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) from normal OCT 
      images of the retina. METHODS: In the proposed method, we demonstrate the 
      feasibility of classifying and detecting severe retinal pathologies from OCT 
      images using a deep convolutional neural network having six convolutional blocks. 
      The classification results are explained using a gradient-based class activation 
      mapping algorithm. RESULTS: Training and validation of the model are performed on 
      a public dataset of 83,484 images with expert-level disease grading of CNV, DME, 
      and drusen, in addition to normal retinal image. We achieved a precision of 
      99.69%, recall of 99.69%, and accuracy of 99.69% with only three 
      misclassifications out of 968 test cases. CONCLUSION: In the proposed work, 
      downsampling and weight sharing were introduced to improve the training 
      efficiency and were found to reduce the trainable parameters significantly. The 
      class activation mapping was also performed, and the output image was similar to 
      the retina's actual color OCT images. The proposed network used only 6.9% of 
      learnable parameters compared to the existing ResNet-50 model and yet 
      outperformed it in classification. The proposed work can be potentially employed 
      in real-time applications due to reduced complexity and fewer learnable 
      parameters over other models.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has the potential to transform medical diagnostics. However, 
      the diagnostic accuracy of DL is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate the 
      diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. 
      Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 
      11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two 
      studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease 
      were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other 
      specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that 
      reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using 
      medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic 
      accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were 
      pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC's ranged between 
      0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration 
      and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In 
      respiratory imaging, AUC's ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung 
      nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC's 
      ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, 
      ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between 
      studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures 
      was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL 
      algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of 
      artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order 
      to provide guidance around key issues in this field.

TI  - k-SALSA: k-anonymous synthetic averaging of retinal images via local style 
      alignment.
PG  - 661-678
LID - 10.1007/978-3-031-19803-8_39 [doi]
AB  - The application of modern machine learning to retinal image analyses offers 
      valuable insights into a broad range of human health conditions beyond ophthalmic 
      diseases. Additionally, data sharing is key to fully realizing the potential of 
      machine learning models by providing a rich and diverse collection of training 
      data. However, the personallyidentifying nature of retinal images, encompassing 
      the unique vascular structure of each individual, often prevents this data from 
      being shared openly. While prior works have explored image de-identification 
      strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other domains (e.g. facial 
      images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving both privacy and 
      clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our work. We therefore 
      introduce k-SALSA, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework for 
      synthesizing retinal fundus images that summarize a given private dataset while 
      satisfying the privacy notion of k-anonymity. k-SALSA brings together 
      state-of-the-art techniques for training and inverting GANs to achieve practical 
      performance on retinal images. Furthermore, k-SALSA leverages a new technique, 
      called local style alignment, to generate a synthetic average that maximizes the 
      retention of fine-grain visual patterns in the source images, thus improving the 
      clinical utility of the generated images. On two benchmark datasets of diabetic 
      retinopathy (EyePACS and APTOS), we demonstrate our improvement upon existing 
      methods with respect to image fidelity, classification performance, and 
      mitigation of membership inference attacks. Our work represents a step toward 
      broader sharing of retinal images for scientific collaboration. Code is available

TI  - Predictive, preventive, and personalized management of retinal fluid via 
      computer-aided detection app for optical coherence tomography scans.
PG  - 547-560
LID - 10.1007/s13167-022-00301-5 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Computer-aided detection systems for retinal fluid could be beneficial for 
      disease monitoring and management by chronic age-related macular degeneration 
      (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients, to assist in disease prevention via 
      early detection before the disease progresses to a "wet AMD" pathology or 
      diabetic macular edema (DME), requiring treatment. We propose a proof-of-concept 
      AI-based app to help predict fluid via a "fluid score", prevent fluid 
      progression, and provide personalized, serial monitoring, in the context of 
      predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) for patients at risk of 
      retinal fluid complications. METHODS: The app comprises a convolutional neural 
      network-Vision Transformer (CNN-ViT)-based segmentation deep learning (DL) 
      network, trained on a small dataset of 100 training images (augmented to 992 
      images) from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study, together 
      with a CNN-based classification network trained on 8497 images, that can detect 
      fluid vs. non-fluid optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Both networks are 
      validated on external datasets. RESULTS: Internal testing for our segmentation 
      network produced an IoU score of 83.0% (95% CI = 76.7-89.3%) and a DICE score of 
      90.4% (86.3-94.4%); for external testing, we obtained an IoU score of 66.7% 
      (63.5-70.0%) and a DICE score of 78.7% (76.0-81.4%). Internal testing of our 
      classification network produced an area under the receiver operating 
      characteristics curve (AUC) of 99.18%, and a Youden index threshold of 0.3806; 
      for external testing, we obtained an AUC of 94.55%, and an accuracy of 94.98% and 
      an F1 score of 85.73% with Youden index. CONCLUSION: We have developed an 
      AI-based app with an alternative transformer-based segmentation algorithm that 
      could potentially be applied in the clinic with a PPPM approach for serial 
      monitoring, and could allow for the generation of retrospective data to research 
      into the varied use of treatments for AMD and DR. The modular system of our app 
      can be scaled to add more iterative features based on user feedback for more 
      efficient monitoring. Further study and scaling up of the algorithm dataset could 
      potentially boost its usability in a real-world clinical setting. SUPPLEMENTARY

AB  - Quantifying the smoothness of different layers of the retina can potentially be 
      an important and practical biomarker in various pathologic conditions like 
      diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated 
      machine learning algorithm which uses support vector regression method with 
      wavelet kernel and automatically segments two hyperreflective retinal layers 
      (inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL)) in 50 optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) slabs and calculates the smoothness index (SI). The 
      Bland-Altman plots, mean absolute error, root mean square error and signed error 
      calculations revealed a modest discrepancy between the manual approach, used as 
      the ground truth, and the corresponding automated segmentation of IPL/ OPL, as 
      well as SI measurements in OCT slabs. It was concluded that the constructed 
      algorithm may be employed as a reliable, rapid and convenient approach for 
      segmenting IPL/OPL and calculating SI in the appropriate layers.

      OCT Angiography.
PG  - 481-492
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3214291 [doi]
AB  - Automatic segmentation and differentiation of retinal arteriole and venule (AV), 
      defined as small blood vessels directly before and after the capillary plexus, 
      are of great importance for the diagnosis of various eye diseases and systemic 
      diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and cardiovascular 
      diseases. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a recent imaging 
      modality that provides capillary-level blood flow information. However, OCTA does 
      not have the colorimetric and geometric differences between AV as the fundus 
      photography does. Various methods have been proposed to differentiate AV in OCTA, 
      which typically needs the guidance of other imaging modalities. In this study, we 
      propose a cascaded neural network to automatically segment and differentiate AV 
      solely based on OCTA. A convolutional neural network (CNN) module is first 
      applied to generate an initial segmentation, followed by a graph neural network 
      (GNN) to improve the connectivity of the initial segmentation. Various CNN and 
      GNN architectures are employed and compared. The proposed method is evaluated on 
      multi-center clinical datasets, including 3 ×3 mm2 and 6 ×6 mm2 OCTA. The 
      proposed method holds the potential to enrich OCTA image information for the 
      diagnosis of various diseases.

AB  - Screening and assessing diabetic retinopathy (DR) are essential for reducing 
      morbidity associated with diabetes. Macular ischemia is known to correlate with 
      the severity of retinopathy. Recent studies have shown that optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA), with intrinsic contrast from blood flow motion, is 
      well suited for quantified analysis of the avascular area, which is potentially a 
      useful biomarker in DR. In this study, we propose the first deep learning 
      solution to segment the avascular area in OCTA of DR. The network design consists 
      of a multi-scaled encoder-decoder neural network (MEDnet) to detect the 
      non-perfusion area in 6 × 6 mm(2) and in ultra-wide field retinal angiograms. 
      Avascular areas were effectively detected in DR subjects of various disease 
      stages as well as in the foveal avascular zone of healthy subjects.

TI  - A difficulty-aware and task-augmentation method based on meta-learning model for 
      few-shot diabetic retinopathy classification.
PG  - 861-876
LID - 10.21037/qims-23-567 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate classification techniques are essential for the early 
      diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the 
      limited amount of annotated DR data poses a challenge for existing deep-learning 
      models. This article proposes a difficulty-aware and task-augmentation method 
      based on meta-learning (DaTa-ML) model for few-shot DR classification with fundus 
      images. METHODS: The difficulty-aware (Da) method operates by dynamically 
      modifying the cross-entropy loss function applied to learning tasks. This 
      methodology has the ability to intelligently down-weight simpler tasks, while 
      simultaneously prioritizing more challenging tasks. These adjustments occur 
      automatically and aim to optimize the learning process. Additionally, the 
      task-augmentation (Ta) method is used to enhance the meta-training process by 
      augmenting the number of tasks through image rotation and improving the 
      feature-extraction capability. To implement the expansion of the meta-training 
      tasks, various task instances can be sampled during the meta-training stage. 
      Ultimately, the proposed Ta method was introduced to optimize the initialization 
      parameters and enhance the meta-generalization performance of the model. The 
      DaTa-ML model showed promising results by effectively addressing the challenges 
      associated with few-shot DR classification. RESULTS: The Asia Pacific 
      Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 blindness detection data set was used to 
      evaluate the DaTa-ML model. The results showed that with only 1% of the training 
      data (5-way, 20-shot) and a single update step (training time reduced by 90%), 
      the DaTa-ML model had an accuracy rate of 89.6% on the test data, which is a 1.7% 
      improvement over the transfer-learning method [i.e., residual neural network 
      (ResNet)50 pre-trained on ImageNet], and a 16.8% improvement over scratch-built 
      models (i.e., ResNet50 without pre-trained weights), despite having fewer 
      trainable parameters (the parameters used by the DaTa-ML model are only 0.47% of 
      the ResNet50 parameters). CONCLUSIONS: The DaTa-ML model provides a more 
      efficient DR classification solution with little annotated data and has 
      significant advantages over state-of-the-art methods. Thus, it could be used to 
      guide and assist ophthalmologists to determine the severity of DR.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Ultrasound-Based Radiomics Nomogram for Diabetic Kidney Disease: 
      A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1877-1885
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S462896 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a radiomics nomogram based on two-dimensional ultrasound 
      for risk assessment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This study retrospectively collected 
      two-dimensional ultrasound images and clinical data from 52 patients with T2DM 
      who underwent renal biopsy in our hospital from January 2023 to August 2023. 
      Based on the pathological results, all patients were categorized into two groups: 
      DKD (n=33) and non-DKD (n=19). The radiomic features of the segmented kidney in 
      ultrasound pictures were retrieved and selected to calculate each patient's 
      rad-score. A predictive nomogram based on rad-score and clinical features was 
      then constructed and validated based on the calibration curve. RESULTS: The 
      rad-score for all patients were computed based on five imaging characteristics 
      extracted from the ultrasound images. The predictive nomogram was developed with 
      the rad-score, diabetic retinopathy, duration of diabetes, and glycosylated 
      hemoglobin. Moreover, This radiomics nomogram showed outstanding calibration 
      capability, discrimination as well as therapeutic usefulness. CONCLUSION: We 
      constructed a nomogram based on two-dimensional ultrasound for DKD in T2DM 
      patientsThe model has been proven to have good predictive performance, showing 
      its potential in identifying DKD in T2DM patients and assisting in making 
      appropriate early interventions.

TI  - Application of an Anomaly Detection Model to Screen for Ocular Diseases Using 
      Color Retinal Fundus Images: Design and Evaluation Study.
PG  - e27822
LID - 10.2196/27822 [doi]
LID - e27822
AB  - BACKGROUND: The supervised deep learning approach provides state-of-the-art 
      performance in a variety of fundus image classification tasks, but it is not 
      applicable for screening tasks with numerous or unknown disease types. The 
      unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) approach, which needs only normal samples to 
      develop a model, may be a workable and cost-saving method of screening for ocular 
      diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an AD model for 
      detecting ocular diseases on the basis of color fundus images. METHODS: A 
      generative adversarial network-based AD method for detecting possible ocular 
      diseases was developed and evaluated using 90,499 retinal fundus images derived 
      from 4 large-scale real-world data sets. Four other independent external test 
      sets were used for external testing and further analysis of the model's 
      performance in detecting 6 common ocular diseases (diabetic retinopathy [DR], 
      glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, hypertensive retinopathy 
      [HR], and myopia), DR of different severity levels, and 36 categories of abnormal 
      fundus images. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model's performance were calculated 
      and presented. RESULTS: Our model achieved an AUC of 0.896 with 82.69% 
      sensitivity and 82.63% specificity in detecting abnormal fundus images in the 
      internal test set, and it achieved an AUC of 0.900 with 83.25% sensitivity and 
      85.19% specificity in 1 external proprietary data set. In the detection of 6 
      common ocular diseases, the AUCs for DR, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, HR, and myopia 
      were 0.891, 0.916, 0.912, 0.867, 0.895, and 0.961, respectively. Moreover, the AD 
      model had an AUC of 0.868 for detecting any DR, 0.908 for detecting referable DR, 
      and 0.926 for detecting vision-threatening DR. CONCLUSIONS: The AD approach 
      achieved high sensitivity and specificity in detecting ocular diseases on the 
      basis of fundus images, which implies that this model might be an efficient and 
      economical tool for optimizing current clinical pathways for ophthalmologists. 
      Future studies are required to evaluate the practical applicability of the AD 
      approach in ocular disease screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The automated screening of patients at risk of developing diabetic 
      retinopathy represents an opportunity to improve their midterm outcome and lower 
      the public expenditure associated with direct and indirect costs of common 
      sight-threatening complications of diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      develop and evaluate the performance of an automated deep learning-based system 
      to classify retinal fundus images as referable and nonreferable diabetic 
      retinopathy cases, from international and Mexican patients. In particular, we 
      aimed to evaluate the performance of the automated retina image analysis (ARIA) 
      system under an independent scheme (ie, only ARIA screening) and 2 assistive 
      schemes (ie, hybrid ARIA plus ophthalmologist screening), using a web-based 
      platform for remote image analysis to determine and compare the sensibility and 
      specificity of the 3 schemes. METHODS: A randomized controlled experiment was 
      performed where 17 ophthalmologists were asked to classify a series of retinal 
      fundus images under 3 different conditions. The conditions were to (1) screen the 
      fundus image by themselves (solo); (2) screen the fundus image after exposure to 
      the retina image classification of the ARIA system (ARIA answer); and (3) screen 
      the fundus image after exposure to the classification of the ARIA system, as well 
      as its level of confidence and an attention map highlighting the most important 
      areas of interest in the image according to the ARIA system (ARIA explanation). 
      The ophthalmologists' classification in each condition and the result from the 
      ARIA system were compared against a gold standard generated by consulting and 
      aggregating the opinion of 3 retina specialists for each fundus image. RESULTS: 
      The ARIA system was able to classify referable vs nonreferable cases with an area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 98%, a sensitivity of 95.1%, 
      and a specificity of 91.5% for international patient cases. There was an area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 98.3%, a sensitivity of 
      95.2%, and a specificity of 90% for Mexican patient cases. The ARIA system 
      performance was more successful than the average performance of the 17 
      ophthalmologists enrolled in the study. Additionally, the results suggest that 
      the ARIA system can be useful as an assistive tool, as sensitivity was 
      significantly higher in the experimental condition where ophthalmologists were 
      exposed to the ARIA system's answer prior to their own classification (93.3%), 
      compared with the sensitivity of the condition where participants assessed the 
      images independently (87.3%; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that 
      both independent and assistive use cases of the ARIA system present, for Latin 
      American countries such as Mexico, a substantial opportunity toward expanding the 
      monitoring capacity for the early detection of diabetes-related blindness.

AB  - In any community, the key to understanding the burden of a specific condition is 
      to conduct an epidemiological study. The deep learning system (DLS) recently 
      showed promising diagnostic performance for diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study 
      aims to use DLS as the grading tool, instead of human assessors, to determine the 
      prevalence and the systemic cardiovascular risk factors for DR on fundus 
      photographs, in patients with diabetes. This is a multi-ethnic (5 races), 
      multi-site (8 datasets from Singapore, USA, Hong Kong, China and Australia), 
      cross-sectional study involving 18,912 patients (n = 93,293 images). We compared 
      these results and the time taken for DR assessment by DLS versus 17 human 
      assessors - 10 retinal specialists/ophthalmologists and 7 professional graders). 
      The estimation of DR prevalence between DLS and human assessors is comparable for 
      any DR, referable DR and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) (Human assessors: 15.9, 
      6.5% and 4.1%; DLS: 16.1%, 6.4%, 3.7%). Both assessment methods identified 
      similar risk factors (with comparable AUCs), including younger age, longer 
      diabetes duration, increased HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, for any DR, 
      referable DR and VTDR (p > 0.05). The total time taken for DLS to evaluate DR 
      from 93,293 fundus photographs was ~1 month compared to 2 years for human 
      assessors. In conclusion, the prevalence and systemic risk factors for DR in 
      multi-ethnic population could be determined accurately using a DLS, in 
      significantly less time than human assessors. This study highlights the potential 
      use of AI for future epidemiology or clinical trials for DR grading in the global 
      communities.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous 
      global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, 
      speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to 
      impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus 
      photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust 
      classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and 
      retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and 
      age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction 
      with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major 
      eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, 
      there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, 
      including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm 
      results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 
      'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is 
      practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art 
      DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in 
      clinical deployment and the path forward.

TI  - Aflibercept Off-Target Effects in Diabetic Macular Edema: An In Silico Modeling 
      Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25073621 [doi]
LID - 3621
AB  - Intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) is a treatment for diabetic macular 
      edema (DME), but its mechanism of action (MoA) has not been completely 
      elucidated. Here, we aimed to explore IAI's MoA and its multi-target nature in 
      DME pathophysiology with an in silico (computer simulation) disease model. We 
      used the Therapeutic Performance Mapping System (Anaxomics Biotech property) to 
      generate mathematical models based on the available scientific knowledge at the 
      time of the study, describing the relationship between the modulation of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) by IAI and DME pathophysiological 
      processes. We also undertook an enrichment analysis to explore the processes 
      modulated by IAI, visualized the effectors' predicted protein activity, and 
      specifically evaluated the role of VEGFR1 pathway inhibition on DME treatment. 
      The models simulated the potential pathophysiology of DME and the likely IAI's 
      MoA by inhibiting VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 signaling. The action of IAI through both 
      signaling pathways modulated the identified pathophysiological processes 
      associated with DME, with the strongest effects in angiogenesis, blood-retinal 
      barrier alteration and permeability, and inflammation. VEGFR1 inhibition was 
      essential to modulate inflammatory protein effectors. Given the role of VEGFR1 
      signaling on the modulation of inflammatory-related pathways, IAI may offer 
      therapeutic advantages for DME through sustained VEGFR1 pathway inhibition.

TI  - Probabilistic Forecasting of Anti-VEGF Treatment Frequency in Neovascular 
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1167/tvst.10.7.30 [doi]
LID - 30
AB  - PURPOSE: To probabilistically forecast needed anti-vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (anti-VEGF) treatment frequency using volumetric spectral domain-optical 
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT) biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular 
      degeneration from real-world settings. METHODS: SD-OCT volume scans were 
      segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness 
      and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early 
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers 
      (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], 
      retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). 
      Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency 
      within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural 
      gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The 
      mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment 
      frequency was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: In a total of 138 visits of 
      99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the 
      prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy 
      (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) 
      using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) 
      using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and 
      reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation 
      of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important 
      predictor across models. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed, fully automated pipeline 
      enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in 
      real-world settings. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Prediction of a probability 
      distribution allows the physician to inspect the underlying uncertainty. 
      Predictive uncertainty estimates are essential to highlight cases where 
      human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is warranted.

      Disease Recognition System.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13111904 [doi]
LID - 1904
AB  - Multiple studies presented satisfactory performances for the treatment of various 
      ocular diseases. To date, there has been no study that describes a multiclass 
      model, medically accurate, and trained on large diverse dataset. No study has 
      addressed a class imbalance problem in one giant dataset originating from 
      multiple large diverse eye fundus image collections. To ensure a real-life 
      clinical environment and mitigate the problem of biased medical image data, 22 
      publicly available datasets were merged. To secure medical validity only Diabetic 
      Retinopathy (DR), Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Glaucoma (GL) were 
      included. The state-of-the-art models ConvNext, RegNet and ResNet were utilized. 
      In the resulting dataset, there were 86,415 normal, 3787 GL, 632 AMD and 34,379 
      DR fundus images. ConvNextTiny achieved the best results in terms of recognizing 
      most of the examined eye diseases with the most metrics. The overall accuracy was 
      80.46 ± 1.48. Specific accuracy values were: 80.01 ± 1.10 for normal eye fundus, 
      97.20 ± 0.66 for GL, 98.14 ± 0.31 for AMD, 80.66 ± 1.27 for DR. A suitable 
      screening model for the most prevalent retinal diseases in ageing societies was 
      designed. The model was developed on a diverse, combined large dataset which made 
      the obtained results less biased and more generalizable.

TI  - Combined automated screening for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic 
      retinopathy in primary care settings.
LID - 12 [pii]
LID - 10.21037/aes-20-114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      are among the leading causes of blindness in the United States and other 
      developed countries. Early detection is the key to prevention and effective 
      treatment. We have built an artificial intelligence-based screening system which 
      utilizes a cloud-based platform for combined large scale screening through 
      primary care settings for early diagnosis of these diseases. METHODS: 
      iHealthScreen Inc., an independent medical software company, has developed 
      automated AMD and DR screening systems utilizing a telemedicine platform based on 
      deep machine learning techniques. For both diseases, we prospectively imaged both 
      eyes of 340 unselected non-dilated subjects over 50 years of age. For DR 
      specifically, 152 diabetic patients at New York Eye and Ear faculty retina 
      practices, ophthalmic and primary care clinics in New York city with color fundus 
      cameras. Following the initial review of the images, 308 images with other 
      confounding conditions like high myopia and vascular occlusion, and poor quality 
      were excluded, leaving 676 eligible images for AMD and DR evaluation. Three 
      ophthalmologists evaluated each of the images, and after adjudication, the 
      patients were determined referrable or non-referable for AMD DR. Concerning AMD, 
      172 were labeled referable (intermediate or late), and 504 were non-referable (no 
      or early). Concurrently, regarding DR, 33 were referable (moderate or worse), and 
      643 were non-referable (none or mild). All images were uploaded to 
      iHealthScreen's telemedicine platform and analyzed by the automated systems for 
      both diseases. The system performances are tested on per eye basis with 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa scores with respect to the 
      professional graders. RESULTS: In identifying referable DR, the system achieved a 
      sensitivity of 97.0% and a specificity of 96.3%, and a kappa score of 0.70 on 
      this prospective dataset. For AMD, the sensitivity was 86.6%, the specificity of 
      92.1%, and a kappa score of 0.76. CONCLUSIONS: The AMD and DR screening tools 
      achieved excellent performance operating together to identify two retinal 
      diseases prospectively in mixed datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of such 
      tools in the early diagnosis of eye diseases. These early screening tools will 
      help create an even more comprehensive system capable of being trained on other 
      retinal pathologies, a goal within reach for public health deployment.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The development of deep learning (DL) systems requires a large 
      amount of data, which may be limited by costs, protection of patient information 
      and low prevalence of some conditions. Recent developments in artificial 
      intelligence techniques have provided an innovative alternative to this challenge 
      via the synthesis of biomedical images within a DL framework known as generative 
      adversarial networks (GANs). This paper aims to introduce how GANs can be 
      deployed for image synthesis in ophthalmology and to discuss the potential 
      applications of GANs-produced images. RECENT FINDINGS: Image synthesis is the 
      most relevant function of GANs to the medical field, and it has been widely used 
      for generating 'new' medical images of various modalities. In ophthalmology, GANs 
      have mainly been utilized for augmenting classification and predictive tasks, by 
      synthesizing fundus images and optical coherence tomography images with and 
      without pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic 
      retinopathy. Despite their ability to generate high-resolution images, the 
      development of GANs remains data intensive, and there is a lack of consensus on 
      how best to evaluate the outputs produced by GANs. SUMMARY: Although the problem 
      of artificial biomedical data generation is of great interest, image synthesis by 
      GANs represents an innovation with yet unclear relevance for ophthalmology.

TI  - Automated detection of hyperreflective foci in the outer nuclear layer of the 
      retina.
PG  - 200-206
LID - 10.1111/aos.15237 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperreflective foci are poorly understood transient elements seen on 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina in both healthy and diseased 
      eyes. Systematic studies may benefit from the development of automated tools that 
      can map and track such foci. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina is an 
      attractive layer in which to study hyperreflective foci as it has no fixed 
      hyperreflective elements in healthy eyes. In this study, we intended to evaluate 
      whether automated image analysis can identify, quantify and visualize 
      hyperreflective foci in the ONL of the retina. METHODS: This longitudinal 
      exploratory study investigated 14 eyes of seven patients including six patients 
      with optic neuropathy and one with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
      In total, 2596 OCT B-scan were obtained. An image analysis blob detector 
      algorithm was used to detect candidate foci, and a convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) trained on a manually labelled subset of data was then used to select those 
      candidate foci in the ONL that fitted the characteristics of the reference foci 
      best. RESULTS: In the manually labelled data set, the blob detector found 2548 
      candidate foci, correctly detecting 350 (89%) out of 391 manually labelled 
      reference foci. The accuracy of CNN classifier was assessed by manually splitting 
      the 2548 candidate foci into a training and validation set. On the validation 
      set, the classifier obtained an accuracy of 96.3%, a sensitivity of 88.4% and a 
      specificity of 97.5% (AUC 0.989). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that 
      automated image analysis and machine learning methods can be used to successfully 
      identify, quantify and visualize hyperreflective foci in the ONL of the retina on 
      OCT scans.

TI  - Trends in the Prevalence of Common Retinal and Optic Nerve Diseases in China: An 
      Artificial Intelligence Based National Screening.
PG  - 28

LID - 28
AB  - PURPOSE: Retinal and optic nerve diseases have become the primary cause of 
      irreversible vision loss and blindness. However, there is still a lack of 
      thorough evaluation regarding their prevalence in China. METHODS: This artificial 
      intelligence-based national screening study applied a previously developed deep 
      learning algorithm, named the Retinal Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis System 
      (RAIDS). De-identified personal medical records from January 2019 to December 
      2021 were extracted from 65 examination centers in 19 provinces of China. Crude 
      prevalence and age-sex-adjusted prevalence were calculated by mapping to the 
      standard population in the seventh national census. RESULTS: In 2021, adjusted 
      referral possible glaucoma (63.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 57.12-68.90 
      cases per 1000), epiretinal macular membrane (21.84, 95% CI = 15.64-29.22), 
      age-related macular degeneration (13.93, 95% CI = 11.09-17.17), and diabetic 
      retinopathy (11.33, 95% CI = 8.89-13.77) ranked the highest among 10 diseases. 
      Female participants had significantly higher adjusted prevalence of pathologic 
      myopia, yet a lower adjusted prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, referral 
      possible glaucoma, and hypertensive retinopathy than male participants. From 2019 
      to 2021, the adjusted prevalence of retinal vein occlusion (0.99, 95% CI = 
      0.73-1.26 to 1.88, 95% CI = 1.42-2.44), macular hole (0.59, 95% CI = 0.41-0.82 to 
      1.12, 95% CI = 0.76-1.51), and hypertensive retinopathy (0.53, 95% CI = 0.40-0.67 
      to 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60-0.95) significantly increased. The prevalence of diabetic 
      retinopathy in participants under 50 years old significant increased. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Retinal and optic nerve diseases are an important public health 
      concern in China. Further well-conceived epidemiological studies are required to 
      validate the observed increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive 
      retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and macular hole nationwide. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: This artificial intelligence system can be a potential tool to monitor 
      the prevalence of major retinal and optic nerve diseases over a wide geographic 
      area.

TI  - Retinal vasculature of different diameters and plexuses exhibit distinct 
      vulnerability in varying severity of diabetic retinopathy.
LID - 10.1038/s41433-024-03021-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the changes in vessel densities (VD) stratified by vessel 
      diameter in the retinal superficial and deep vascular complexes (SVC/DVC) using 
      optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images obtained from people with 
      diabetes and age-matched healthy controls. METHODS: We quantified the VD based on 
      vessel diameter categorized as <10, 10-20 and >20 μm in the SVC/DVC obtained on 
      3 × 3 mm(2) OCTA scans using a deep learning-based segmentation and vascular 
      graph extraction tool in people with diabetes and age-matched healthy controls. 
      RESULTS: OCTA images obtained from 854 eyes of 854 subjects were divided into 5 
      groups: healthy controls (n = 555); people with diabetes with no diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR, n = 90), mild and moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) (n = 96), 
      severe NPDR (n = 42) and proliferative DR (PDR) (n = 71). Both SVC and DVC showed 
      significant decrease in VD with increasing DR severity (p < 0.001). The largest 
      difference was observed in the <10 μm vessels of the SVC between healthy controls 
      and no DR (13.9% lower in no DR, p < 0.001). Progressive decrease in <10 μm 
      vessels of the SVC and DVC was seen with increasing DR severity (p < 0.001). 
      However, 10-20 μm vessels only showed decline in the DVC, but not the SVC 
      (p < 0.001) and there was no change observed in the >20 μm vessels in either 
      plexus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that OCTA is able to demonstrate a 
      distinct vulnerability of the smallest retinal vessels in both plexuses that 
      worsens with increasing severity of DR.

TI  - Automatic generation of retinal optical coherence tomography images based on 
      generative adversarial networks.
PG  - 7357-7367
LID - 10.1002/mp.15988 [doi]
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: The automatic generation algorithm of optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) images based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) can generate a large 
      number of simulation images by a relatively small number of real images, which 
      can effectively improve the classification performance. AIM: We proposed an 
      automatic generation algorithm for retinal OCT images based on GAN to alleviate 
      the problem of insufficient images with high quality in deep learning, and put 
      the diagnosis algorithm toward clinical application. APPROACH: We designed a 
      generation network based on GAN and trained the network with a data set 
      constructed by 2014_BOE_Srinivasan and OCT2017 to acquire three models. Then, we 
      generated a large number of images by the three models to augment age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and normal images. We 
      evaluated the generated images by subjective visual observation, Fréchet 
      inception distance (FID) scores, and a classification experiment. RESULTS: Visual 
      observation shows that the generated images have clear and similar features 
      compared with the real images. Also, the lesion regions containing similar 
      features in the real image and the generated image are randomly distributed in 
      the image field of view. When the FID scores of the three types of generated 
      images are lowest, three local optimal models are obtained for AMD, DME, and 
      normal images, indicating the generated images have high quality and diversity. 
      Moreover, the classification experiment results show that the model performance 
      trained with the mixed images is better than that of the model trained with real 
      images, in which the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are improved by 
      5.56%, 8.89%, and 2.22%. In addition, compared with the generation method based 
      on variational auto-encoder (VAE), the method improved the accuracy, sensitivity, 
      and specificity by 1.97%, 2.97%, and 0.99%, for the same test set. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results show that our method can augment the three kinds of OCT images, not 
      only effectively alleviating the problem of insufficient images with high quality 
      but also improving the diagnosis performance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become 
      widespread due to the advanced technologies and availability of digital data. 
      Supervised learning algorithms have shown human-level performance or even better 
      and are better feature extractor-quantifier than unsupervised learning 
      algorithms. To get huge dataset with good quality control, there is a need of an 
      annotation tool with a customizable feature set. This paper evaluates the 
      viability of having an in house annotation tool which works on a smartphone and 
      can be used in a healthcare setting. METHODS: We developed a smartphone-based 
      grading system to help researchers in grading multiple retinal fundi. The process 
      consisted of designing the flow of user interface (UI) keeping in view feedback 
      from experts. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of change in speed of a 
      grader over time and feature usage statistics was done. The dataset size was 
      approximately 16,000 images with adjudicated labels by a minimum of 2 doctors. 
      Results for an AI model trained on the images graded using this tool and its 
      validation over some public datasets were prepared. RESULTS: We created a DL 
      model and analysed its performance for a binary referrable DR Classification 
      task, whether a retinal image has Referrable DR or not. A total of 32 doctors 
      used the tool for minimum of 20 images each. Data analytics suggested significant 
      portability and flexibility of the tool. Grader variability for images was in 
      favour of agreement on images annotated. Number of images used to assess 
      agreement is 550. Mean of 75.9% was seen in agreement. CONCLUSION: Our aim was to 
      make Annotation of Medical imaging easier and to minimize time taken for 
      annotations without quality degradation. The user feedback and feature usage 
      statistics confirm our hypotheses of incorporation of brightness and contrast 
      variations, green channels and zooming add-ons in correlation to certain disease 
      types. Simulation of multiple review cycles and establishing quality control can 
      boost the accuracy of AI models even further. Although our study aims at 
      developing an annotation tool for diagnosing and classifying diabetic retinopathy 
      fundus images but same concept can be used for fundus images of other ocular 
      diseases as well as other streams of medical science such as radiology where 
      image-based diagnostic applications are utilised.

TI  - Developing a Continuous Severity Scale for Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 Using 
      Deep Learning and Implications for Disease Grading.

AB  - PURPOSE: Deep learning (DL) models have achieved state-of-the-art medical 
      diagnosis classification accuracy. Current models are limited by discrete 
      diagnosis labels, but could yield more information with diagnosis in a continuous 
      scale. We developed a novel continuous severity scaling system for macular 
      telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 by combining a DL classification model with 
      uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). DESIGN: We used a DL 
      network to learn a feature representation of MacTel severity from discrete 
      severity labels and applied UMAP to embed this feature representation into 2 
      dimensions, thereby creating a continuous MacTel severity scale. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      total of 2003 OCT volumes were analyzed from 1089 MacTel Project participants. 
      METHODS: We trained a multiview DL classifier using multiple B-scans from OCT 
      volumes to learn a previously published discrete 7-step MacTel severity scale. 
      The classifiers' last feature layer was extracted as input for UMAP, which 
      embedded these features into a continuous 2-dimensional manifold. The DL 
      classifier was assessed in terms of test accuracy. Rank correlation for the 
      continuous UMAP scale against the previously published scale was calculated. 
      Additionally, the UMAP scale was assessed in the κ agreement against 5 clinical 
      experts on 100 pairs of patient volumes. For each pair of patient volumes, 
      clinical experts were asked to select the volume with more severe MacTel disease 
      and to compare them against the UMAP scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Classification 
      accuracy for the DL classifier and κ agreement versus clinical experts for UMAP. 
      RESULTS: The multiview DL classifier achieved top 1 accuracy of 63.3% (186/294) 
      on held-out test OCT volumes. The UMAP metric showed a clear continuous gradation 
      of MacTel severity with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.84 with the previously 
      published scale. Furthermore, the continuous UMAP metric achieved κ agreements of 
      0.56 to 0.63 with 5 clinical experts, which was comparable with interobserver κ 
      values. CONCLUSIONS: Our UMAP embedding generated a continuous MacTel severity 
      scale, without requiring continuous training labels. This technique can be 
      applied to other diseases and may lead to more accurate diagnosis, improved 
      understanding of disease progression, and key imaging features for pathologic 
      characteristics. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosure

AB  - AIMS: This study's objective was to evaluate whether deep learning (DL) on 
      retinal photographs from a diabetic retinopathy screening programme improve 
      prediction of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: DL models were 
      trained to jointly predict future CVD risk and CVD risk factors and used to 
      output a DL score. Poisson regression models including clinical risk factors with 
      and without a DL score were fitted to study cohorts with 2,072 and 38,730 
      incident CVD events in type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) respectively. 
      RESULTS: DL scores were independently associated with incident CVD with adjusted 
      standardised incidence rate ratios of 1.14 (P = 3 × 10(-04) 95 % CI (1.06, 1.23)) 
      and 1.16 (P = 4 × 10(-33) 95 % CI (1.13, 1.18)) in T1DM and T2DM cohorts 
      respectively. The differences in predictive performance between models with and 
      without a DL score were statistically significant (differences in test 
      log-likelihood 6.7 and 51.1 natural log units) but the increments in C-statistics 
      from 0.820 to 0.822 and from 0.709 to 0.711 for T1DM and T2DM respectively, were 
      small. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that in people with diabetes, retinal 
      photographs contain information on future CVD risk. However for this to 
      contribute appreciably to clinical prediction of CVD further approaches, 
      including exploitation of serial images, need to be evaluated.

AB  - Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of 
      irreversible visual impairment in the elderly. The current management of nAMD is 
      limited and involves regular intravitreal administration of anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). However, the effectiveness of these 
      treatments is limited by overlapping and compensatory pathways leading to 
      unresponsiveness to anti-VEGF treatments in a significant portion of nAMD 
      patients. Therefore, a system view of pathways involved in pathophysiology of 
      nAMD will have significant clinical value. The aim of this study was to identify 
      proteins, miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), various metabolites, and 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a significant role in the 
      pathogenesis of nAMD. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a multi-layer network 
      analysis, which identified 30 key genes, six miRNAs, and four lncRNAs. We also 
      found three key metabolites that are common with AMD, Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and schizophrenia. Moreover, we identified nine key SNPs and their related genes 
      that are common among AMD, AD, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis (MS), and 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, our findings suggest that there exists a 
      connection between nAMD and the aforementioned neurodegenerative disorders. In 
      addition, our study also demonstrates the effectiveness of using artificial 
      intelligence, specifically the LSTM network, a fuzzy logic model, and genetic 
      algorithms, to identify important metabolites in complex metabolic pathways to 
      open new avenues for the design and/or repurposing of drugs for nAMD treatment.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-enabled screening for diabetic retinopathy: a real-world, 
      multicenter and prospective study.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001596 [doi]
LID - e001596
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) with an efficient and 
      scalable method is highly needed to reduce blindness, due to the growing epidemic 
      of diabetes. The aim of the study was to validate an artificial 
      intelligence-enabled DR screening and to investigate the prevalence of DR in 
      adult patients with diabetes in China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was 
      prospectively conducted at 155 diabetes centers in China. A non-mydriatic, 
      macula-centered fundus photograph per eye was collected and graded through a deep 
      learning (DL)-based, five-stage DR classification. Images from a randomly 
      selected one-third of participants were used for the DL algorithm validation. 
      RESULTS: In total, 47 269 patients (mean (SD) age, 54.29 (11.60) years) were 
      enrolled. 15 805 randomly selected participants were reviewed by a panel of 
      specialists for DL algorithm validation. The DR grading algorithms had a 83.3% 
      (95% CI: 81.9% to 84.6%) sensitivity and a 92.5% (95% CI: 92.1% to 92.9%) 
      specificity to detect referable DR. The five-stage DR classification performance 
      (concordance: 83.0%) is comparable to the interobserver variability of 
      specialists (concordance: 84.3%). The estimated prevalence in patients with 
      diabetes detected by DL algorithm for any DR, referable DR and vision-threatening 
      DR were 28.8% (95% CI: 28.4% to 29.3%), 24.4% (95% CI: 24.0% to 24.8%) and 10.8% 
      (95% CI: 10.5% to 11.1%), respectively. The prevalence was higher in female, 
      elderly, longer diabetes duration and higher glycated hemoglobin groups. 
      CONCLUSION: This study performed, a nationwide, multicenter, DL-based DR 
      screening and the results indicated the importance and feasibility of DR 
      screening in clinical practice with this system deployed at diabetes centers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct an external validation of an automated artificial 
      intelligence (AI) diagnostic system using fundus photographs from a real-life 
      multicentre cohort. METHODS: We designed external validation in multiple 
      scenarios, consisting of 3049 images from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in 
      China (QHSDU, validation dataset 1), 7495 images from three other hospitals in 
      China (validation dataset 2), and 516 images from high myopia (HM) population of 
      QHSDU (validation dataset 3). The corresponding sensitivity, specificity and 
      accuracy of this AI diagnostic system to identify glaucomatous optic neuropathy 
      (GON) were calculated. RESULTS: In validation datasets 1 and 2, the algorithm 
      yielded accuracy of 93.18% and 91.40%, area under the receiver operating curves 
      (AUC) of 95.17% and 96.64%, and significantly higher sensitivity of 91.75% and 
      91.41%, respectively, compared to manual graders. On the subsets complicated with 
      retinal comorbidities, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular 
      degeneration, in validation datasets 1 and 2, the algorithm achieved accuracy of 
      87.54% and 93.81%, and AUC of 97.02% and 97.46%, respectively. In validation 
      dataset 3, the algorithm achieved comparable accuracy of 81.98% and AUC of 
      87.49%, with a sensitivity of 83.61% and specificity of 81.76% on GON recognition 
      specifically in the HM population. CONCLUSIONS: With acceptable generalization 
      capability across varying levels of image quality, different clinical centres, or 
      certain retinal comorbidities, such as HM, the automatic AI diagnostic system had 
      the potential to provide expert-level glaucoma detection.

AB  - PURPOSE: To predict visual outcomes and treatment needs in a treat & extend (T&E) 
      regimen in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) using a machine 
      learning model based on quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging 
      biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study eyes of 270 treatment-naïve subjects, 
      randomized to receiving ranibizumab therapy in the T&E arm of a randomized 
      clinical trial were considered. OCT volume scans were processed at baseline and 
      at the first follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Automated image segmentation was 
      performed, where intraretinal (IRF), subretinal (SRF) fluid, pigment epithelial 
      detachment (PED), hyperreflective foci, and the photoreceptor layer were 
      delineated using a convolutional neural network (CNN). A set of respective 
      quantitative imaging biomarkers were computed across an Early Treatment Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid to describe the retinal pathomorphology spatially 
      and its change after the first injection. Lastly, using the computed set of OCT 
      features and available clinical and demographic information, predictive models of 
      outcomes and retreatment intervals were built using machine learning and their 
      performance evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Data of 228 
      evaluable patients were included, as some had missing scans or were lost to 
      follow-up. Of those patients, 55% reached and maintained long (8, 10, 12 weeks) 
      and another 45% stayed at short (4, 6 weeks) treatment intervals. This provides 
      further evidence for a high disease activity in a major proportion of patients. 
      The model predicted the extendable treatment interval group with an AUROC of 
      0.71, and the visual outcome with an AUROC of up to 0.87 when utilizing both, 
      clinical and imaging features. The volume of SRF and the volume of IRF, remaining 
      at the first follow-up visit, were found to be the most important predictive 
      markers for treatment intervals and visual outcomes, respectively, supporting the 
      important role of quantitative fluid parameters on OCT. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) methodology was able to predict visual outcomes and 
      retreatment intervals of a T&E regimen from a single injection. The result of 
      this study is an urgently needed step toward AI-supported management of patients 
      with active and progressive nAMD.

TI  - A deep learning system for predicting time to progression of diabetic 
      retinopathy.
PG  - 584-594

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness 
      worldwide. The risk of DR progression is highly variable among different 
      individuals, making it difficult to predict risk and personalize screening 
      intervals. We developed and validated a deep learning system (DeepDR Plus) to 
      predict time to DR progression within 5 years solely from fundus images. First, 
      we used 717,308 fundus images from 179,327 participants with diabetes to pretrain 
      the system. Subsequently, we trained and validated the system with a multiethnic 
      dataset comprising 118,868 images from 29,868 participants with diabetes. For 
      predicting time to DR progression, the system achieved concordance indexes of 
      0.754-0.846 and integrated Brier scores of 0.153-0.241 for all times up to 5 
      years. Furthermore, we validated the system in real-world cohorts of participants 
      with diabetes. The integration with clinical workflow could potentially extend 
      the mean screening interval from 12 months to 31.97 months, and the percentage of 
      participants recommended to be screened at 1-5 years was 30.62%, 20.00%, 19.63%, 
      11.85% and 17.89%, respectively, while delayed detection of progression to 
      vision-threatening DR was 0.18%. Altogether, the DeepDR Plus system could predict 
      individualized risk and time to DR progression over 5 years, potentially allowing 
      personalized screening intervals.

TI  - Deep learning to infer visual acuity from optical coherence tomography in 
      diabetic macular edema.
PG  - 1008950
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.1008950 [doi]
LID - 1008950
AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the leading causes of visual 
      impairment in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Physicians rely on optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT) and baseline visual acuity (VA) to tailor therapeutic regimen. 
      However, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from chart-based examinations may 
      not wholly reflect DME status. Chart-based examinations are subjected findings 
      dependent on the patient's recognition functions and are often confounded by 
      concurrent corneal, lens, retinal, optic nerve, or extraocular disorders. The 
      ability to infer VA from objective optical coherence tomography (OCT) images 
      provides the predicted VA from objective macular structures directly and a better 
      understanding of diabetic macular health. Deviations from chart-based and 
      artificial intelligence (AI) image-based VA will prompt physicians to assess 
      other ocular abnormalities affecting the patients VA and whether pursuing 
      anti-VEGF treatment will likely yield increment in VA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      enrolled a retrospective cohort of 251 DME patients from Big Data Center (BDC) of 
      Taipei Veteran General Hospital (TVGH) from February 2011 and August 2019. A 
      total of 3,920 OCT images, labeled as "visually impaired" or "adequate" according 
      to baseline VA, were grouped into training (2,826), validation (779), and testing 
      cohort (315). We applied confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curve to evaluate the performance. RESULTS: We developed an OCT-based 
      convolutional neuronal network (CNN) model that could classify two VA classes by 
      the threshold of 0.50 (decimal notation) with an accuracy of 75.9%, a sensitivity 
      of 78.9%, and an area under the ROC curve of 80.1% on the testing cohort. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility of inferring VA from routine 
      objective retinal images. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Serves as a pilot study to 
      encourage further use of deep learning in deriving functional outcomes and 
      secondary surrogate endpoints for retinal diseases.

PG  - e18605

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetes can induce diabetic retinopathy (DR), and the 
      blindness caused by this disease is irreversible. The early analysis of mouse 
      retinal images, including the layer and cell segmentation properties of these 
      images, can help to effectively diagnose this disease. METHOD: In the study, we 
      design a dilated residual method based on a feature pyramid network (FPN), in 
      which the FPN is adopted as the base network for solving the multiscale 
      segmentation problem concerning mouse retinal images. In the bottom-up encoding 
      pathway, we construct our backbone feature extraction network via the combination 
      of dilated convolution and a residual block, further increasing the range of the 
      receptive field to obtain more context information. At the same time, we 
      integrate a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention module into the backbone 
      network to obtain more small object details. In the top-down decoding pathway, we 
      replace the traditional nearest-neighbor upsampling method with the transposed 
      convolution method and add a segmentation head to obtain semantic segmentation 
      results. RESULTS: The effectiveness of our network model is verified in two 
      segmentation tasks: ganglion cell segmentation and mouse retinal cell and layer 
      segmentation. The outcomes demonstrate that, compared to other supervised 
      segmentation methods based on deep learning, our model attains the utmost 
      precision in both binary segmentation and multiclass semantic segmentation tasks. 
      CONCLUSION: The dilated residual FPN is a robust method for mouse retinal image 
      segmentation and it can effectively assist DR diagnosis.

TI  - Support vector machine and deep-learning object detection for localisation of 
      hard exudates.
PG  - 16045

AB  - Hard exudates are one of the main clinical findings in the retinal images of 
      patients with diabetic retinopathy. Detecting them early significantly impacts 
      the treatment of underlying diseases; therefore, there is a need for automated 
      systems with high reliability. We propose a novel method for identifying and 
      localising hard exudates in retinal images. To achieve fast image pre-scanning, a 
      support vector machine (SVM) classifier was combined with a faster region-based 
      convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN) object detector for the localisation 
      of exudates. Rapid pre-scanning filtered out exudate-free samples using a feature 
      vector extracted from the pre-trained ResNet-50 network. Subsequently, the 
      remaining samples were processed using a faster R-CNN detector for detailed 
      analysis. When evaluating all the exudates as individual objects, the SVM 
      classifier reduced the false positive rate by 29.7% and marginally increased the 
      false negative rate by 16.2%. When evaluating all the images, we recorded a 50% 
      reduction in the false positive rate, without any decrease in the number of false 
      negatives. The interim results suggested that pre-scanning the samples using the 
      SVM prior to implementing the deep-network object detector could simultaneously 
      improve and speed up the current hard exudates detection method, especially when 
      there is paucity of training data.

TI  - Microaneurysms segmentation with a U-Net based on recurrent residual

AB  - Microaneurysms (MAs) play an important role in the diagnosis of clinical diabetic 
      retinopathy at the early stage. Annotation of MAs manually by experts is 
      laborious and so it is essential to develop automatic segmentation methods. 
      Automatic MA segmentation remains a challenging task mainly due to the low local 
      contrast of the image and the small size of MAs. A deep learning-based method 
      called U-Net has become one of the most popular methods for the medical image 
      segmentation task. We propose an architecture for U-Net, named deep recurrent 
      U-Net (DRU-Net), obtained by combining the deep residual model and recurrent 
      convolutional operations into U-Net. In the MA segmentation task, DRU-Net can 
      accumulate effective features much better than the typical U-Net. The proposed 
      method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets: E-Ophtha and IDRiD. Our 
      results show that the proposed DRU-Net achieves the best performance with 0.9999 
      accuracy value and 0.9943 area under curve (AUC) value on the E-Ophtha dataset. 
      And on the IDRiD dataset, it has achieved 0.987 AUC value (to our knowledge, this 
      is the first result of segmenting MAs on this dataset). Compared with other 
      methods, such as U-Net, FCNN, and ResU-Net, our architecture (DRU-Net) achieves 
      state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - TDCAU-Net: retinal vessel segmentation using transformer dilated convolutional 
      attention-based U-Net method.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ad1273 [doi]
AB  - Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field, facilitating 
      the identification of numerous chronic conditions based on retinal vessel images. 
      These conditions include diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, 
      glaucoma, and others. Although the U-Net model has shown promising results in 
      retinal vessel segmentation, it tends to struggle with fine branching and dense 
      vessel segmentation. To further enhance the precision of retinal vessel 
      segmentation, we propose a novel approach called transformer dilated convolution 
      attention U-Net (TDCAU-Net), which builds upon the U-Net architecture with 
      improved Transformer-based dilated convolution attention mechanisms. The proposed 
      model retains the three-layer architecture of the U-Net network. The Transformer 
      component enables the learning of contextual information for each pixel in the 
      image, while the dilated convolution attention prevents information loss. The 
      algorithm efficiently addresses several challenges to optimize blood vessel 
      detection. The process starts with five-step preprocessing of the images, 
      followed by chunking them into segments. Subsequently, the retinal images are fed 
      into the modified U-Net network introduced in this paper for segmentation. The 
      study employs eye fundus images from the DRIVE and CHASEDB1 databases for both 
      training and testing purposes. Evaluation metrics are utilized to compare the 
      algorithm's results with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental analysis on 
      both databases demonstrates that the algorithm achieves high values of 
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC. Specifically, for the first 
      database, the achieved values are 0.8187, 0.9756, 0.9556, and 0.9795, 
      respectively. For the second database, the corresponding values are 0.8243, 
      0.9836, 0.9738, and 0.9878, respectively. These results demonstrate that the 
      proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher 
      performance on both datasets. The TDCAU-Net model presented in this study 
      exhibits substantial capabilities in accurately segmenting fine branching and 
      dense vessels. The segmentation performance of the network surpasses that of the 
      U-Net algorithm and several mainstream methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to estimate the regional choroidal thickness from color 
      fundus images from convolutional neural networks in different network structures 
      and task learning models. METHOD: 1276 color fundus photos and their 
      corresponding choroidal thickness values from healthy subjects were obtained from 
      the Topcon DRI Triton optical coherence tomography machine. Initially, ten 
      commonly used convolutional neural networks were deployed to identify the most 
      accurate model, which was subsequently selected for further training. This 
      selected model was then employed in combination with single-, multiple-, and 
      auxiliary-task training models to predict the average and sub-region choroidal 
      thickness in both ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) grids and 
      100-grid subregions. The values of mean absolute error and coefficient of 
      determination (R(2)) were involved to evaluate the models' performance. RESULTS: 
      Efficientnet-b0 network outperformed other networks with the lowest mean absolute 
      error value (25.61 μm) and highest R(2) (0.7817) in average choroidal thickness. 
      Incorporating diopter spherical, anterior chamber depth, and lens thickness as 
      auxiliary tasks improved predicted accuracy (p-value = 6.39 × 10-44, 
      2.72 × 10-38, 1.15 × 10-36 respectively). For ETDRS regional choroidal thickness 
      estimation, multi-task model achieved better results than single task model 
      (lowest mean absolute error = 31.10 μm vs. 33.20 μm). The multi-task training 
      also can simultaneously predict the choroidal thickness of 100 grids with a 
      minimum mean absolute error of 33.86 μm. CONCLUSIONS: Efficientnet-b0, in 
      combination with multi-task and auxiliary task models, achieve high accuracy in 
      estimating average and regional macular choroidal thickness directly from color 
      fundus photographs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accurate segmentation of the intra-retinal tissue 
      layers in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images plays an important role in 
      the diagnosis and treatment of ocular diseases such as Age-Related Macular 
      Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The existing energy 
      minimization based methods employ multiple, manually handcrafted cost terms and 
      often fail in the presence of pathologies. In this work, we eliminate the need to 
      handcraft the energy by learning it from training images in an end-to-end manner. 
      Our method can be easily adapted to pathologies by re-training it on an 
      appropriate dataset. METHODS: We propose a Conditional Random Field (CRF) 
      framework for the joint multi-layer segmentation of OCT B-scans. The appearance 
      of each retinal layer and boundary is modeled by two convolutional filter banks 
      and the shape priors are modeled using Gaussian distributions. The total CRF 
      energy is linearly parameterized to allow a joint, end-to-end training by 
      employing the Structured Support Vector Machine formulation. RESULTS: The 
      proposed method outperformed three benchmark algorithms on four public datasets. 
      The NORMAL-1 and NORMAL-2 datasets contain healthy OCT B-scans while the AMD-1 
      and DME-1 dataset contain B-scans of AMD and DME cases respectively. The proposed 
      method achieved an average unsigned boundary localization error (U-BLE) of 
      1.52 pixels on NORMAL-1, 1.11 pixels on NORMAL-2 and 2.04 pixels on the combined 
      NORMAL-1 and DME-1 dataset across the eight layer boundaries, outperforming the 
      three benchmark methods in each case. The Dice coefficient was 0.87 on NORMAL-1, 
      0.89 on NORMAL-2 and 0.84 on the combined NORMAL-1 and DME-1 dataset across the 
      seven retinal layers. On the combined NORMAL-1 and AMD-1 dataset, we achieved an 
      average U-BLE of 1.86 pixels on the ILM, inner and outer RPE boundaries and a 
      Dice of 0.98 for the ILM-RPE(in) region and 0.81 for the RPE layer. CONCLUSION: 
      We have proposed a supervised CRF based method to jointly segment multiple tissue 
      layers in OCT images. It can aid the ophthalmologists in the quantitative 
      analysis of structural changes in the retinal tissue layers for clinical practice 
      and large-scale clinical studies.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the status of falls and to identify important risk 
      factors for falls in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) including the 
      non-elderly. Participants were 316 persons with T2D who were assessed for medical 
      history, laboratory data and physical capabilities during hospitalization and 
      given a questionnaire on falls one year after discharge. Two different 
      statistical models, logistic regression and random forest classifier, were used 
      to identify the important predictors of falls. The response rate to the survey 
      was 72%; of the 226 respondents, there were 129 males and 97 females (median age 
      62 years). The fall rate during the first year after discharge was 19%. Logistic 
      regression revealed that knee extension strength, fasting C-peptide (F-CPR) level 
      and dorsiflexion strength were independent predictors of falls. The random forest 
      classifier placed grip strength, F-CPR, knee extension strength, dorsiflexion 
      strength and proliferative diabetic retinopathy among the 5 most important 
      variables for falls. Lower extremity muscle weakness, elevated F-CPR levels and 
      reduced grip strength were shown to be important risk factors for falls in T2D. 
      Analysis by random forest can identify new risk factors for falls in addition to 
      logistic regression.

TI  - Development of a Fundus Image-Based Deep Learning Diagnostic Tool for Various 
      Retinal Diseases.

LID - 321
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools have been accepted in 
      ophthalmology. The use of retinal images, such as fundus photographs, is a 
      promising approach for the development of AI-based diagnostic platforms. Retinal 
      pathologies usually occur in a broad spectrum of eye diseases, including 
      neovascular or dry age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane, 
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, macular hole, retinal 
      vein occlusions, and diabetic retinopathy. Here, we report a fundus image-based 
      AI model for differential diagnosis of retinal diseases. We classified retinal 
      images with three convolutional neural network models: ResNet50, VGG19, and 
      Inception v3. Furthermore, the performance of several dense (fully connected) 
      layers was compared. The prediction accuracy for diagnosis of nine classes of 
      eight retinal diseases and normal control was 87.42% in the ResNet50 model, which 
      added a dense layer with 128 nodes. Furthermore, our AI tool augments 
      ophthalmologist's performance in the diagnosis of retinal disease. These results 
      suggested that the fundus image-based AI tool is applicable for the medical 
      diagnosis process of retinal diseases.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2016, 1.6 million deaths 
      caused were due to diabetes. Precise and on-time diagnosis of type-II diabetes is 
      crucial to reduce the risk of various diseases such as heart disease, stroke, 
      kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and macrovascular 
      problems. The non-invasive methods like machine learning are reliable and 
      efficient in classifying the people subjected to type-II diabetics risk and 
      healthy people into two different categories. This present study aims to develop 
      a stacking-based integrated kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model for 
      identifying the risk of type-II diabetic patients based on the follow-up time on 
      the diabetes research center dataset. The Pima Indian Diabetic Dataset (PIDD) and 
      a Diabetic Research Center dataset are used in this study. A min-max 
      normalization is used to preprocess the noisy datasets. The Hybrid Particle Swarm 
      Optimization-Artificial Fish Swarm Optimization (HAFPSO) algorithm used satisfies 
      the multi-objective problem by increasing the Classification Accuracy (CA) and 
      decreasing the kernel complexity of the optimal learners (NBC) selected. At last, 
      the model is integrated by utilizing the KELM as a meta-classifier which combines 
      the predictions of the twenty Base Learners as a whole. The proposed 
      classification method helps the clinicians to predict the patients who are at a 
      high risk of type-II diabetes in the future with the highest accuracy of 98.5%. 
      The proposed method is tested with different measures such as accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, Mathews Correlation Coefficient, and Kappa Statistics 
      are calculated. The results obtained show that the KELM-HAFPSO approach is a 
      promising new tool for identifying type-II diabetes.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetic complication affecting the eyes, which is 
      the main cause of blindness in young and middle-aged people. In order to speed up 
      the diagnosis of DR, a mass of deep learning methods have been used for the 
      detection of this disease, but they failed to attain excellent results due to 
      unbalanced training data, i.e., the lack of DR fundus images. To address the 
      problem of data imbalance, this paper proposes a method dubbed retinal fundus 
      images generative adversarial networks (RF-GANs), which is based on generative 
      adversarial network, to synthesize retinal fundus images. RF-GANs is composed of 
      two generation models, RF-GAN1 and RF-GAN2. Firstly, RF-GAN1 is employed to 
      translate retinal fundus images from source domain (the domain of semantic 
      segmentation datasets) to target domain (the domain of EyePACS dataset connected 
      to Kaggle (EyePACS)). Then, we train the semantic segmentation models with the 
      translated images, and employ the trained models to extract the structural and 
      lesion masks (hereafter, we refer to it as Masks) of EyePACS. Finally, we employ 
      RF-GAN2 to synthesize retinal fundus images using the Masks and DR grading 
      labels. This paper verifies the effectiveness of the method: RF-GAN1 can narrow 
      down the domain gap between different datasets to improve the performance of the 
      segmentation models. RF-GAN2 can synthesize realistic retinal fundus images. 
      Adopting the synthesized images for data augmentation, the accuracy and quadratic 
      weighted kappa of the state-of-the-art DR grading model on the testing set of 
      EyePACS increase by 1.53% and 1.70%, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature on artificial intelligence (AI)-related topics has 
      been expanding rapidly over the last two decades, showing that AI is a crucial 
      force in advancing ophthalmology. This analysis aims to provide a dynamic and 
      longitudinal bibliometric analysis of AI-related ophthalmic papers. METHODS: The 
      Web of Science was searched to retrieve papers regarding the application of AI in 
      ophthalmology published in the English language up to May 2022. The variables 
      were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 9. Data visualization 
      was performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 
      1,686 publications were analyzed. Recently, AI-related ophthalmology research has 
      increased exponentially. China was the most productive country in this research 
      field, with 483 articles, but the United States of America (446 publications) 
      contributed most to the sum of citations and the H-index. The League of European 
      Research Universities, Ting DSW, and Daniel SW were the most prolific institution 
      and researchers. This field is primarily concerned with diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR), glaucoma, optical coherence tomography, and the classification and 
      diagnosis of fundus pictures. Current hotspots in AI research include deep 
      learning, diagnosing and predicting systemic disorders by fundus images, 
      incidence and progression of ocular diseases, and outcome prediction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This analysis thoroughly reviews AI-related research in 
      ophthalmology to help academics better comprehend the growth and possible 
      practice consequences of AI. The association between eye and systemic biomarkers, 
      telemedicine, real-world studies, and the development and application of new AI 
      algorithms, such as visual converters, will continue to be research hotspots over 
      the next few years.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Automatic artery/vein (A/V) segmentation from fundus images is 
      required to track blood vessel changes occurring with many pathologies including 
      retinopathy and cardiovascular pathologies. One of the clinical measures that 
      quantifies vessel changes is the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) which represents the 
      ratio between artery and vein diameters. This measure significantly depends on 
      the accuracy of vessel segmentation and classification into arteries and veins. 
      This paper proposes a fast, novel method for semantic A/V segmentation combining 
      deep learning and graph propagation. METHODS: A convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) is proposed to jointly segment and classify vessels into arteries and 
      veins. The initial CNN labeling is propagated through a graph representation of 
      the retinal vasculature, whose nodes are defined as the vessel branches and edges 
      are weighted by the cost of linking pairs of branches. To efficiently propagate 
      the labels, the graph is simplified into its minimum spanning tree. RESULTS: The 
      method achieves an accuracy of 94.8% for vessels segmentation. The A/V 
      classification achieves a specificity of 92.9% with a sensitivity of 93.7% on the 
      CT-DRIVE database compared to the state-of-the-art-specificity and sensitivity, 
      both of 91.7%. CONCLUSION: The results show that our method outperforms the 
      leading previous works on a public dataset for A/V classification and is by far 
      the fastest. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed global AVR calculated on the whole fundus 
      image using our automatic A/V segmentation method can better track vessel changes 
      associated to diabetic retinopathy than the standard local AVR calculated only 
      around the optic disc.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive usefulness of quantitative imaging 
      biomarkers, acquired automatically from OCT scans, of cross-sectional and future 
      visual outcomes of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
      (AMD) starting anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Treatment-naive, first-treated eyes of 
      patients with neovascular AMD between 2007 and 2017 at Moorfields Eye Hospital (a 
      large, United Kingdom single center) undergoing anti-VEGF therapy. METHODS: 
      Automatic segmentation was carried out by applying a deep learning segmentation 
      algorithm to 137 379 OCT scans from 6467 eyes of 3261 patients with neovascular 
      AMD. After applying selection criteria, 926 eyes of 926 patients were analyzed. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation coefficients (R(2) values) and mean absolute 
      error (MAE) between quantitative OCT (qOCT) parameters and cross-sectional visual 
      function, as well as the predictive value of these parameters for short-term 
      visual change, that is, incremental visual acuity (VA) resulting from an 
      individual injection, as well as VA at distant time points (up to 12 months after 
      baseline). RESULTS: Visual acuity at distant time points could be predicted: 
      R(2) = 0.80 (MAE, 5.0 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) 
      and R(2) = 0.7 (MAE, 7.2 ETDRS letters) after injection at 3 and at 12 months 
      after baseline (P < 0.001 for both), respectively. Best performing models 
      included both baseline qOCT parameters and treatment response. Furthermore, we 
      present proof-of-principle evidence that the incremental change in VA from an 
      injection can be predicted: R(2) = 0.14 (MAE, 5.6 ETDRS letters) for injection 2 
      and R(2) = 0.11 (MAE, 5.0 ETDRS letters) for injection 3 (P < 0.001 for both). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Automatic segmentation enables rapid acquisition of quantitative and 
      reproducible OCT biomarkers with potential to inform treatment decisions in the 
      care of neovascular AMD. This furthers development of point-of-care decision-aid 
      systems for personalized medicine.

TI  - Predicting Visual Improvement After Macular Hole Surgery: A Combined Model Using 
      Deep Learning and Clinical Features.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.4.6 [doi]
LID - 6
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of deep learning 
      (DL) methods to enhance the prediction of visual acuity (VA) improvement after 
      macular hole (MH) surgery from a combined model using DL on high-definition 
      optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) B-scans and clinical features. METHODS: We 
      trained a DL convolutional neural network (CNN) using pre-operative HD-OCT 
      B-scans of the macula and combined with a logistic regression model of 
      pre-operative clinical features to predict VA increase ≥15 Early Treatment 
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at 6 months post-vitrectomy in closed 
      MHs. A total of 121 MHs with 242 HD-OCT B-scans and 484 clinical data points were 
      used to train, validate, and test the model. Prediction of VA increase was 
      evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC) and F1 scores. We also extracted the weight of each input feature in the 
      hybrid model. RESULTS: All performances are reported on the held-out test set, 
      matching results obtained with cross-validation. Using a regression on clinical 
      features, the AUROC was 80.6, with an F1 score of 79.7. For the CNN, relying 
      solely on the HD-OCT B-scans, the AUROC was 72.8 ± 14.6, with a F1 score of 61.5 
      ± 23.7. For our hybrid regression model using clinical features and CNN 
      prediction, the AUROC was 81.9 ± 5.2, with an F1 score of 80.4 ± 7.7. In the 
      hybrid model, the baseline VA was the most important feature (weight = 59.1 ± 
      6.9%), while the weight of HD-OCT prediction was 9.6 ± 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Both 
      the clinical data and HD-OCT models can predict postoperative VA improvement in 
      patients undergoing vitrectomy for a MH with good discriminative performances. 
      Combining them into a hybrid model did not significantly improve performance. 
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: OCT-based DL models can predict postoperative VA 
      improvement following vitrectomy for MH but fusing those models with clinical 
      data might not provide improved predictive performance.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify biomarkers for predicting response to anti-vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in diabetic macular edema (DME) and 
      evaluate any links between cytokine expression and optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) phenotype. DESIGN: The IMAGINE is a post hoc image analysis and cytokine 
      expression assessment of the Efficacy & Safety Trial of Intravitreal Injections 
      Combined With PRP for CSME Secondary to Diabetes Mellitus (DAVE) randomized 
      clinical trial. METHODS: Subjects were categorized as anatomical responders or 
      nonresponders, and within the responder group as rebounders and non-rebounders 
      based on quantitative, longitudinal OCT criteria. Retinal layer and fluid 
      features were extracted using an OCT machine-learning augmented segmentation 
      platform. Responders were further sub-classified by rapidity of response. Aqueous 
      concentrations of 54 cytokines were measured at multiple timepoints. Expression 
      was compared between responder groups and correlated with OCT imaging biomarkers. 
      RESULTS: Of the 24 eyes studied, 79% were anatomical responders with 38% super 
      responders, 17% early responders, and 25% slow responders. Twenty-one percent 
      were nonresponders. Super responders had increased baseline vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) (880.0 pg/mL vs 245.4 pg/mL; P = .012) and decreased 
      monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (513.3 pg/mL vs 809.5 pg/mL; P = .0.042) 
      concentrations compared with nonresponders. Interleukin-6 (-24.9 pg/mL vs 442.8 
      pg/mL; P = .032) concentrations increased among nonresponders during therapy. 
      VEGF concentrations correlated with central subfield thickness (r = 0.49; P = 
      .01). Panmacular retinal volume correlated with increased interleuckin-6 (r = 
      0.47; P = .02) and decreased MCP-1 (r = -0.45; P = .03). Matrix 
      metallopeptidase-1 correlated with subretinal fluid volume (r = 0.50; P = .01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: OCT imaging biomarkers correlated with both intraocular cytokines 
      and responsiveness to anti-VEGF therapy, which indicated a possible link to 
      underlying pathways and their relevance to DME prognosis. Baseline concentrations 
      of VEGF and MCP-1 are associated with anatomic response to anti-VEGF therapy.

AB  - Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is the most common sight-threatening complication of 
      type 2 diabetes. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the most useful imaging 
      technique to diagnose, follow up, and evaluate treatments for DME. However, OCT 
      exam and devices are expensive and unavailable in all clinics in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Our primary goal was therefore to develop an alternative 
      method to OCT for DME diagnosis by introducing spectral information derived from 
      spontaneous electroretinogram (ERG) signals as a single input or combined with 
      fundus that is much more widespread. Baseline ERGs were recorded in 233 patients 
      and transformed into scalograms and spectrograms via Wavelet and Fourier 
      transforms, respectively. Using transfer learning, distinct Convolutional Neural 
      Networks (CNN) were trained as classifiers for DME using OCT, scalogram, 
      spectrogram, and eye fundus images. Input data were randomly split into training 
      and test sets with a proportion of 80 %-20 %, respectively. The top performers 
      for each input type were selected, OpticNet-71 for OCT, DenseNet-201 for eye 
      fundus, and non-evoked ERG-derived scalograms, to generate a combined model by 
      assigning different weights for each of the selected models. Model validation was 
      performed using a dataset alien to the training phase of the models. None of the 
      models powered by mock ERG-derived input performed well. In contrast, hybrid 
      models showed better results, in particular, the model powered by eye fundus 
      combined with mock ERG-derived information with a 91 % AUC and 86 % F1-score, and 
      the model powered by OCT and mock ERG-derived scalogram images with a 93 % AUC 
      and 89 % F1-score. These data show that the spontaneous ERG-derived input adds 
      predictive value to the fundus- and OCT-based models to diagnose DME, except for 
      the sensitivity of the OCT model which remains the same. The inclusion of mock 
      ERG signals, which have recently been shown to take only 5 min to record in 
      daylight conditions, therefore represents a potential improvement over existing 
      OCT-based models, as well as a reliable and cost-effective alternative when 
      combined with the fundus, especially in underserved areas, to predict DME.

TI  - Assessment of Parafoveal Diabetic Macular Ischemia on Optical Coherence 
      Tomography Angiography Images to Predict Diabetic Retinal Disease Progression and 
      Visual Acuity Deterioration.
PG  - 641-649
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.1821 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The presence of diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) on optical coherence 
      tomography angiography (OCTA) images predicts diabetic retinal disease 
      progression and visual acuity (VA) deterioration, suggesting an OCTA-based DMI 
      evaluation can further enhance diabetic retinopathy (DR) management. OBJECTIVE: 
      To investigate whether an automated binary DMI algorithm using OCTA images 
      provides prognostic value on DR progression, diabetic macular edema (DME) 
      development, and VA deterioration in a cohort of patients with diabetes. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, DMI assessment of superficial 
      capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus OCTA images was performed by a 
      previously developed deep learning algorithm. The presence of DMI was defined as 
      images exhibiting disruption of fovea avascular zone with or without additional 
      areas of capillary loss, while absence of DMI was defined as images presented 
      with intact fovea avascular zone outline and normal distribution of vasculature. 
      Patients with diabetes were recruited starting in July 2015 and were followed up 
      for at least 4 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the 
      association of the presence of DMI with DR progression, DME development, and VA 
      deterioration. Analysis took place between June and December 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: DR progression, DME development, and VA deterioration. RESULTS: A 
      total of 321 eyes from 178 patients were included for analysis (85 [47.75%] 
      female; mean [SD] age, 63.39 [11.04] years). Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 
      50.41 (48.16-56.48) months, 105 eyes (32.71%) had DR progression, 33 eyes 
      (10.28%) developed DME, and 68 eyes (21.18%) had VA deterioration. Presence of 
      superficial capillary plexus-DMI (hazard ratio [HR], 2.69; 95% CI, 1.64-4.43; 
      P < .001) and deep capillary plexus-DMI (HR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.94-5.30; P < .001) 
      at baseline were significantly associated with DR progression, whereas presence 
      of deep capillary plexus-DMI was also associated with DME development (HR, 4.60; 
      95% CI, 1.15-8.20; P = .003) and VA deterioration (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.01-5.22; 
      P = .04) after adjusting for age, duration of diabetes, fasting glucose, glycated 
      hemoglobin, mean arterial blood pressure, DR severity, ganglion cell-inner 
      plexiform layer thickness, axial length, and smoking at baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this study, the presence of DMI on OCTA images demonstrates 
      prognostic value for DR progression, DME development, and VA deterioration.

TI  - Early inner plexiform layer thinning and retinal nerve fiber layer thickening in 
      excitotoxic retinal injury using deep learning-assisted optical coherence 
      tomography.

AB  - Excitotoxicity from the impairment of glutamate uptake constitutes an important 
      mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, 
      and Parkinson's disease. Within the eye, excitotoxicity is thought to play a 
      critical role in retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, 
      retinal ischemia, and optic nerve injury, yet how excitotoxic injury impacts 
      different retinal layers is not well understood. Here, we investigated the 
      longitudinal effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic retinal 
      injury in a rat model using deep learning-assisted retinal layer thickness 
      estimation. Before and after unilateral intravitreal NMDA injection in nine adult 
      Long Evans rats, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to 
      acquire volumetric retinal images in both eyes over 4 weeks. Ten retinal layers 
      were automatically segmented from the OCT data using our deep learning-based 
      algorithm. Retinal degeneration was evaluated using layer-specific retinal 
      thickness changes at each time point (before, and at 3, 7, and 28 days after NMDA 
      injection). Within the inner retina, our OCT results showed that retinal thinning 
      occurred first in the inner plexiform layer at 3 days after NMDA injection, 
      followed by the inner nuclear layer at 7 days post-injury. In contrast, the 
      retinal nerve fiber layer exhibited an initial thickening 3 days after NMDA 
      injection, followed by normalization and thinning up to 4 weeks post-injury. Our 
      results demonstrated the pathological cascades of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity 
      across different layers of the retina. The early inner plexiform layer thinning 
      suggests early dendritic shrinkage, whereas the initial retinal nerve fiber layer 
      thickening before subsequent normalization and thinning indicates early 
      inflammation before axonal loss and cell death. These findings implicate the 
      inner plexiform layer as an early imaging biomarker of excitotoxic retinal 
      degeneration, whereas caution is warranted when interpreting the ganglion cell 
      complex combining retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and inner 
      plexiform layer thicknesses in conventional OCT measures. Deep learning-assisted 
      retinal layer segmentation and longitudinal OCT monitoring can help evaluate the 
      different phases of retinal layer damage upon excitotoxicity.

TI  - Classification of diabetic maculopathy based on optical coherence tomography 
      images using a Vision Transformer model.
LID - 10.1136/bmjophth-2023-001423 [doi]
LID - e001423
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a Vision Transformer model to detect different stages of 
      diabetic maculopathy (DM) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. 
      METHODS: After removing images with poor quality, a total of 3319 OCT images were 
      extracted from the Eye Center of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and 
      randomly split the images into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. All 
      macular cross-sectional scan OCT images were collected retrospectively from the 
      eyes of DM patients from 2016 to 2022. One of the OCT stages of DM, including 
      early diabetic macular oedema (DME), advanced DME, severe DME and atrophic 
      maculopathy, was labelled on the collected images, respectively. A deep learning 
      (DL) model based on Vision Transformer was trained to detect four OCT grading of 
      DM. RESULTS: The model proposed in our paper can provide an impressive detection 
      performance. We achieved an accuracy of 82.00%, an F1 score of 83.11%, an area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96. The AUC for the 
      detection of four OCT grading (ie, early DME, advanced DME, severe DME and 
      atrophic maculopathy) was 0.96, 0.95, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively, with an 
      accuracy of 90.87%, 89.96%, 94.42% and 95.13%, respectively, a precision of 
      88.46%, 80.31%, 89.42% and 87.74%, respectively, a sensitivity of 87.03%, 88.18%, 
      63.39% and 89.42%, respectively, a specificity of 93.02%, 90.72%, 98.40% and 
      96.66%, respectively and an F1 score of 87.74%, 84.06%, 88.18% and 88.57%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our DL model based on Vision Transformer demonstrated a 
      relatively high accuracy in the detection of OCT grading of DM, which can help 
      with patients in a preliminary screening to identify groups with serious 
      conditions. These patients need a further test for an accurate diagnosis, and a 
      timely treatment to obtain a good visual prognosis. These results emphasised the 
      potential of artificial intelligence in assisting clinicians in developing 
      therapeutic strategies with DM in the future.

      population-based cohort study of Asian adults.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.81878 [doi]
LID - e81878
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) techniques improve disease prediction by 
      identifying the most relevant features in multidimensional data. We compared the 
      accuracy of ML algorithms for predicting incident diabetic kidney disease (DKD). 
      METHODS: We utilized longitudinal data from 1365 Chinese, Malay, and Indian 
      participants aged 40-80 y with diabetes but free of DKD who participated in the 
      baseline and 6-year follow-up visit of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases 
      Study (2004-2017). Incident DKD (11.9%) was defined as an estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with at least 25% decrease in eGFR at 
      follow-up from baseline. A total of 339 features, including participant 
      characteristics, retinal imaging, and genetic and blood metabolites, were used as 
      predictors. Performances of several ML models were compared to each other and to 
      logistic regression (LR) model based on established features of DKD (age, sex, 
      ethnicity, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and body mass 
      index) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 
      RESULTS: ML model Elastic Net (EN) had the best AUC (95% CI) of 0.851 
      (0.847-0.856), which was 7.0% relatively higher than by LR 0.795 (0.790-0.801). 
      Sensitivity and specificity of EN were 88.2 and 65.9% vs. 73.0 and 72.8% by LR. 
      The top 15 predictors included age, ethnicity, antidiabetic medication, 
      hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, eGFR, and 
      metabolites related to lipids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, and ketone bodies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that ML, together with feature selection, 
      improves prediction accuracy of DKD risk in an asymptomatic stable population and 
      identifies novel risk factors, including metabolites. FUNDING: This study was 
      supported by the National Medical Research Council, NMRC/OFLCG/001/2017 and 
      NMRC/HCSAINV/MOH-001019-00. The funders had no role in study design, data

      Generation of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
PG  - 258-264
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.6156 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Deep learning (DL) used for discriminative tasks in ophthalmology, 
      such as diagnosing diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration 
      (AMD), requires large image data sets graded by human experts to train deep 
      convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). In contrast, generative DL techniques 
      could synthesize large new data sets of artificial retina images with different 
      stages of AMD. Such images could enhance existing data sets of common and rare 
      ophthalmic diseases without concern for personally identifying information to 
      assist medical education of students, residents, and retinal specialists, as well 
      as for training new DL diagnostic models for which extensive data sets from large 
      clinical trials of expertly graded images may not exist. OBJECTIVE: To develop DL 
      techniques for synthesizing high-resolution realistic fundus images serving as 
      proxy data sets for use by retinal specialists and DL machines. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Generative adversarial networks were trained on 133 821 color 
      fundus images from 4613 study participants from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 
      (AREDS), generating synthetic fundus images with and without AMD. We compared 
      retinal specialists' ability to diagnose AMD on both real and synthetic images, 
      asking them to assess image gradability and testing their ability to discern real 
      from synthetic images. The performance of AMD diagnostic DCNNs (referable vs not 
      referable AMD) trained on either all-real vs all-synthetic data sets was 
      compared. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Accuracy of 2 retinal specialists (T.Y.A.L. 
      and K.D.P.) for diagnosing and distinguishing AMD on real vs synthetic images and 
      diagnostic performance (area under the curve) of DL algorithms trained on 
      synthetic vs real images. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of 2 retinal 
      specialists on real vs synthetic images was similar. The accuracy of diagnosis as 
      referable vs nonreferable AMD compared with certified human graders for retinal 
      specialist 1 was 84.54% (error margin, 4.06%) on real images vs 84.12% (error 
      margin, 4.16%) on synthetic images and for retinal specialist 2 was 89.47% (error 
      margin, 3.45%) on real images vs 89.19% (error margin, 3.54%) on synthetic 
      images. Retinal specialists could not distinguish real from synthetic images, 
      with an accuracy of 59.50% (error margin, 3.93%) for retinal specialist 1 and 
      53.67% (error margin, 3.99%) for retinal specialist 2. The DCNNs trained on real 
      data showed an area under the curve of 0.9706 (error margin, 0.0029), and those 
      trained on synthetic data showed an area under the curve of 0.9235 (error margin, 
      0.0045). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Deep learning-synthesized images appeared to 
      be realistic to retinal specialists, and DCNNs achieved diagnostic performance on 
      synthetic data close to that for real images, suggesting that DL generative 
      techniques hold promise for training humans and machines.

AB  - PURPOSE: Visual acuity, measured by resolution of optotypes on a standard eye 
      chart, is a critical clinical test for function of the visual system in humans. 
      Behavioral tests in animals can be used to estimate visual acuity. However, such 
      tests may be limited in the study of mutants or after synthetic vision 
      restoration techniques. Because the total response of the retina to a visual 
      scene is encoded in spiking patterns of retinal ganglion cells, it should be 
      possible to estimate visual acuity in vitro from the retina by analyzing retinal 
      ganglion cell output in response to test stimuli. METHODS: We created a method, 
      EyeCandy, that combines a visual stimulus-generating engine with analysis of 
      multielectrode array retinal recordings via a machine learning approach to 
      measure murine retinal acuity in vitro. Visual stimuli included static 
      checkerboards, drifting gratings, and letter optotypes. RESULTS: In retinas from 
      wild-type C57Bl/6 mice, retinal acuity measurement for a drifting grating was 0.4 
      cycles per degree. In contrast, retinas from adult rd1 mice with outer retinal 
      degeneration showed no detectable acuity. A comparison of acuities among 
      different regions of the retina revealed substantial variation, with the 
      inferior-nasal quadrant having highest RA. Letter classification accuracy of a 
      projected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy eye chart reached 99% accuracy for 
      logMAR 3.0 letters. EyeCandy measured a restored RA of 0.05 and 0.08 cycles per 
      degree for static and dynamic stimuli respectively from the retina of the rd1 
      mouse treated with the azobenzene photoswitch BENAQ. CONCLUSIONS: Machine 
      learning may be used to estimate retinal acuity. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The use 
      of ex vivo retinal acuity measurement may allow determination of effects of 
      mutations, drugs, injury, or other manipulations on retinal visual function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To diagnose key pathologies of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
      and diabetic macular edema (DME) quickly and accurately, researchers attempted to 
      develop effective artificial intelligence methods by using medical images. 
      RESULTS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning capability 
      is proposed and appropriate hyperparameters are selected for classifying optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) images of AMD and DME. To perform transfer learning, a 
      pre-trained CNN model is used as the starting point for a new CNN model for 
      solving related problems. The hyperparameters (parameters that have set values 
      before the learning process begins) in this study were algorithm hyperparameters 
      that affect learning speed and quality. During training, different CNN-based 
      models require different algorithm hyperparameters (e.g., optimizer, learning 
      rate, and mini-batch size). Experiments showed that, after transfer learning, the 
      CNN models (8-layer Alexnet, 22-layer Googlenet, 16-layer VGG, 19-layer VGG, 
      18-layer Resnet, 50-layer Resnet, and a 101-layer Resnet) successfully classified 
      OCT images of AMD and DME. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results further showed 
      that, after transfer learning, the VGG19, Resnet101, and Resnet50 models with 
      appropriate algorithm hyperparameters had excellent capability and performance in 
      classifying OCT images of AMD and DME.

TI  - Imaging Features of Vessels and Leakage Patterns Predict Extended Interval 
      Aflibercept Dosing Using Ultra-Widefield Angiography in Retinal Vascular Disease: 
      Findings From the PERMEATE Study.
PG  - 1777-1786
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2020.3018464 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and macular edema secondary to retinal occlusion 
      (RVO) are the two most common retinal vascular causes of visual impairment and 
      leading cause of worldwide vision loss. The blood-retinal barrier is the key 
      barrier for maintaining fluid balance within the retinal tissue. Vascular 
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) has a significant role in the permeability of 
      the blood-retinal barrier, which also leads to appearance of leakage foci. 
      Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is the current gold standard treatment and has 
      been demonstrated to improve macular thickening, improve vision acuity and reduce 
      vascular leakage. However, treatment response and required dosing interval can 
      vary widely across patients. Given the role of the blood-retinal barrier and 
      vascular leakage in the pathogenesis of these disorders, the goal of this study 
      was to present and evaluate new computer extracted features relating to 
      morphology, spatial architecture and tortuosity of vessels and leakages from 
      baseline ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) images. Specifically, we 
      sought to evaluate the role of these computer extracted features from baseline 
      UWFA images. Notably, these UWFA images were obtained from IRB-approved PERMEATE 
      clinical trial [1], [2] to distinguish eyes tolerating extended dosing intervals 
      (n = 16) who are referred to as non-rebounders and those who require more 
      frequent dosing (n = 12) and are called rebounders based on visual acuity loss 
      with extended dosing challenges. A total of 64 features encapsulating different 
      morphological and geometrical attributes of leakage patches including the 
      anatomical (shape, size, density, area, minor and major axis, orientation, area, 
      extent ratio, perimeter, radii) and geometrical characteristics (the proximity of 
      each leakage foci to main vessels, to other leakage foci and to optical disc) as 
      well as 54 tortuosity features (tortuosity of whole vessel network, local 
      tortuosity of vessels in the vicinity of leakage foci) were extracted. The most 
      significant and predictive biomarkers related to treatment response were 
      proximity of leakage nodes to major and minor eye vessels as well as local 
      vasculature tortuosity in the vicinity of the leakages. The imaging features were 
      then used in conjunction with a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier to 
      distinguish rebounders from non-rebounders. The 3-fold cross-validated Area Under 
      Curve (AUC) was found to be 0.82 for the morphological based features and 0.85 
      for the tortuosity based features. Our findings suggest higher variation in 
      leakage node proximity to retinal vessels in eyes tolerating extended interval 
      dosing. In contrast, eyes with increased local vascular tortuosity demonstrated 
      less tolerance of increased dosing interval. Moreover, a class activation map 
      generated by a deep learning model identified regions that corresponded to 
      regions of leakages proximal to the vessels, providing confirmation of the 
      validity of predictive image features extracted from these regions in this study.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop an automated system with artificial 
      intelligence algorithms to comprehensively identify pathologic retinal cases and 
      make urgent referrals. METHODS: To build and test the intelligent system, this 
      study obtained 28,664 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from 2254 
      patients in the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University (EENT Hospital) and 
      Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital (TENTH Hospital). We applied a deep learning 
      model with an adapted feature pyramid network to detect 15 categories of retinal 
      pathologies from OCT images as common signs of various retinal diseases. 
      Subsequently, the pathologies detected in the OCT images and thickness features 
      extracted from retinal thickness measurements were combined for urgent referral 
      using the random forest tool. RESULTS: The retinal pathologies detection model 
      had a sensitivity of 96.39% and specificity of 98.91% from the EENT Hospital test 
      dataset, whereas those from the TENTH Hospital test dataset were 94.89% and 
      98.76%, respectively. The urgent referral model achieved accuracies of 98.12% and 
      98.01% from the EENT Hospital and TENTH Hospital test datasets, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An intelligent system capable of automatically identifying 
      pathologic retinal cases and offering urgent referrals was developed and 
      demonstrated reliable performance with high sensitivity, specificity, and 
      accuracy. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This intelligent system has great value and 
      practicability in communities where exist increasing cases of retinal disease and 
      a lack of ophthalmologists.

AB  - Intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) is characterized by the pathological 
      narrowing or occlusion of the inner lumen of intracranial blood vessels. However, 
      the retina can indirectly react to cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, retinal 
      fundus images (RFI) serve as valuable noninvasive and easily accessible screening 
      tools for early detection and diagnosis of ICAS. This paper introduces an 
      adversarial learning-based domain adaptation algorithm (ALDA) specifically 
      designed for ICAS detection in multi-source datasets. The primary objective is to 
      achieve accurate detection and enhanced generalization of ICAS based on RFI. 
      Given the limitations of traditional algorithms in meeting the accuracy and 
      generalization requirements, ALDA overcomes these challenges by leveraging RFI 
      datasets from multiple sources and employing the concept of adversarial learning 
      to facilitate feature representation sharing and distinguishability learning. In 
      order to evaluate the performance of the ALDA algorithm, we conducted 
      experimental validation on multi-source datasets. We compared its results with 
      those obtained from other deep learning algorithms in the ICAS detection task. 
      Furthermore, we validated the potential of ALDA for detecting diabetic 
      retinopathy. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the significant 
      improvements achieved by the ALDA algorithm. By leveraging information from 
      diverse datasets, ALDA learns feature representations that exhibit enhanced 
      generalizability and robustness. This makes it a reliable auxiliary diagnostic 
      tool for clinicians, thereby facilitating the prevention and treatment of 
      cerebrovascular diseases.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF TRANSFER LEARNING FOR SELECT RETINAL DISEASE CLASSIFICATION.
PG  - 174-183
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000003282 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of transfer learning for classification of 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) by fundus photography and select retinal diseases by 
      spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: Five widely used 
      open-source deep neural networks and four customized simpler and smaller 
      networks, termed the CBR family, were trained and evaluated on two tasks: 1) 
      classification of DR using fundus photography and 2) classification of drusen, 
      choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic macular edema using SD-OCT. For DR 
      classification, the quadratic weighted Kappa coefficient was used to measure the 
      level of agreement between each network and ground truth-labeled test cases. For 
      SD-OCT-based classification, accuracy was calculated for each network. Kappa and 
      accuracy were compared between iterations with and without use of transfer 
      learning for each network to assess for its effect. RESULTS: For DR 
      classification, Kappa increased with transfer learning for all networks (range of 
      increase 0.152-0.556). For SD-OCT-based classification, accuracy increased for 
      four of five open-source deep neural networks (range of increase 1.8%-3.5%), 
      slightly decreased for the remaining deep neural network (-0.6%), decreased 
      slightly for three of four CBR networks (range of decrease 0.9%-1.8%), and 
      decreased by 9.6% for the remaining CBR network. CONCLUSION: Transfer learning 
      improved performance, as measured by Kappa, for DR classification for all 
      networks, although the effect ranged from small to substantial. Transfer learning 
      had minimal effect on accuracy for SD-OCT-based classification for eight of the 
      nine networks analyzed. These results imply that transfer learning may 
      substantially increase performance for DR classification but may have minimal 
      effect for SD-OCT-based classification.

TI  - A risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with retinopathy 
      based on machine learning and its application in health management.
PG  - 1136653

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish a risk prediction model for diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) in the Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population using 
      few inspection indicators and to propose suggestions for chronic disease 
      management. METHODS: This multi-centered retrospective cross-sectional study was 
      conducted among 2,385 patients with T2DM. The predictors of the training set 
      were, respectively, screened by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a random 
      forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm, a backpropagation neural 
      network (BPNN), and a least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) model. 
      Model I, a prediction model, was established through multivariable logistic 
      regression analysis based on the predictors repeated ≥3 times in the four 
      screening methods. Logistic regression Model II built on the predictive factors 
      in the previously released DR risk study was introduced into our current study to 
      evaluate the model's effectiveness. Nine evaluation indicators were used to 
      compare the performance of the two prediction models, including the area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, recall, 
      F1 score, balanced accuracy, calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and Net 
      Reclassification Index (NRI). RESULTS: When including predictors, such as 
      glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, disease course, postprandial blood glucose, age, 
      systolic blood pressure, and albumin/urine creatinine ratio, multivariable 
      logistic regression Model I demonstrated a better prediction ability than Model 
      II. Model I revealed the highest AUROC (0.703), accuracy (0.796), precision 
      (0.571), recall (0.035), F1 score (0.066), Hosmer-Lemeshow test (0.887), NRI 
      (0.004), and balanced accuracy (0.514). CONCLUSION: We have built an accurate DR 
      risk prediction model with fewer indicators for patients with T2DM. It can be 
      used to predict the individualized risk of DR in China effectively. In addition, 
      the model can provide powerful auxiliary technical support for the clinical and 
      health management of patients with diabetes comorbidities.

TI  - Early Prediction of Diabetes Using an Ensemble of Machine Learning Models.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191912378 [doi]
LID - 12378
AB  - Diabetes is one of the most rapidly spreading diseases in the world, resulting in 
      an array of significant complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney 
      failure, diabetic retinopathy, and neuropathy, among others, which contribute to 
      an increase in morbidity and mortality rate. If diabetes is diagnosed at an early 
      stage, its severity and underlying risk factors can be significantly reduced. 
      However, there is a shortage of labeled data and the occurrence of outliers or 
      data missingness in clinical datasets that are reliable and effective for 
      diabetes prediction, making it a challenging endeavor. Therefore, we introduce a 
      newly labeled diabetes dataset from a South Asian nation (Bangladesh). In 
      addition, we suggest an automated classification pipeline that includes a 
      weighted ensemble of machine learning (ML) classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB), Random 
      Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), and LightGBM (LGB). Grid search 
      hyperparameter optimization is employed to tune the critical hyperparameters of 
      these ML models. Furthermore, missing value imputation, feature selection, and 
      K-fold cross-validation are included in the framework design. A statistical 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) test reveals that the performance of diabetes 
      prediction significantly improves when the proposed weighted ensemble (DT + RF + 
      XGB + LGB) is executed with the introduced preprocessing, with the highest 
      accuracy of 0.735 and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.832. In conjunction 
      with the suggested ensemble model, our statistical imputation and RF-based 
      feature selection techniques produced the best results for early diabetes 
      prediction. Moreover, the presented new dataset will contribute to developing and 
      implementing robust ML models for diabetes prediction utilizing population-level 
      data.

      through machine learning (ML), including the ability to learn from past 
      experiences. In healthcare, ML is currently applied within controlled settings in 
      devices to diagnose conditions like diabetic retinopathy without clinician input, 
      for instance. In order to allow AI-based medical devices (AIMDs) to adapt 
      actively to its data environment through ML, the current risk-based regulatory 
      approaches are inadequate in facilitating this technological progression. Recent 
      and innovative regulatory changes introduced to regulate AIMDs as a software, or 
      'software as a medical device' (SaMD), and the adoption of a total 
      device/product-specific lifecycle approach (rather than one that is 
      point-in-time) reflect a shift away from the strictly risk-based approach to one 
      that is more collaborative and participatory in nature, and anticipatory in 
      character. These features are better explained by a rights-based approach and 
      consistent with the human right to science (HRS). With reference to the recent 
      explication of the normative content of HRS by the Committee on Economic, Social 
      and Cultural Rights of the United Nations, this paper explains why a rights-based 
      approach that is centred on HRS could be a more effective response to the 
      regulatory challenges posed by AIMDs. The paper also considers how such a 
      rights-based approach could be implemented in the form of a regulatory network 
      that draws on a 'common fund of knowledges' to formulate anticipatory responses 
      to adaptive AIMDs. In essence, the HRS provides both the mandate and the 
      obligation for states to ensure that regulatory governance of high connectivity 
      AIMDs become increasingly collaborative and participatory in approach and 
      pluralistic in substance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural study of retinal blood vessels provides an early 
      indication of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertensive 
      retinopathy. These studies require accurate tracing of retinal vessel tree 
      structure from fundus images in an automated manner. However, the existing work 
      encounters great difficulties when dealing with the crossover issue commonly-seen 
      in vessel networks. RESULTS: In this paper, we consider a novel graph-based 
      approach to address this tracing with crossover problem: After initial steps of 
      segmentation and skeleton extraction, its graph representation can be 
      established, where each segment in the skeleton map becomes a node, and a direct 
      contact between two adjacent segments is translated to an undirected edge of the 
      two corresponding nodes. The segments in the skeleton map touching the optical 
      disk area are considered as root nodes. This determines the number of trees 
      to-be-found in the vessel network, which is always equal to the number of root 
      nodes. Based on this undirected graph representation, the tracing problem is 
      further connected to the well-studied transductive inference in machine learning, 
      where the goal becomes that of properly propagating the tree labels from those 
      known root nodes to the rest of the graph, such that the graph is partitioned 
      into disjoint sub-graphs, or equivalently, each of the trees is traced and 
      separated from the rest of the vessel network. This connection enables us to 
      address the tracing problem by exploiting established development in transductive 
      inference. Empirical experiments on public available fundus image datasets 
      demonstrate the applicability of our approach. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a novel 
      and systematic approach to trace retinal vessel trees with the present of 
      crossovers by solving a transductive learning problem on induced undirected 
      graphs.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The lack of experienced ophthalmologists limits the early diagnosis 
      of retinal diseases. Artificial intelligence can be an efficient real-time way 
      for screening retinal diseases. OBJECTIVE: To develop and prospectively validate 
      a deep learning (DL) algorithm that, based on ocular fundus images, recognizes 
      numerous retinal diseases simultaneously in clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, diagnostic study at 65 public medical 
      screening centers and hospitals in 19 Chinese provinces included individuals 
      attending annual routine medical examinations and participants of 
      population-based and community-based studies. EXPOSURES: Based on 120 002 ocular 
      fundus photographs, the Retinal Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis System (RAIDS) 
      was developed to identify 10 retinal diseases. RAIDS was validated in a 
      prospective collected data set, and the performance between RAIDS and 
      ophthalmologists was compared in the data sets of the population-based Beijing 
      Eye Study and the community-based Kailuan Eye Study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      The performance of each classifier included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, 
      F1 score, and Cohen κ score. RESULTS: In the prospective validation data set of 
      208 758 images collected from 110 784 individuals (median [range] age, 42 [8-87] 
      years; 115 443 [55.3%] female), RAIDS achieved a sensitivity of 89.8% (95% CI, 
      89.5%-90.1%) to detect any of 10 retinal diseases. RAIDS differentiated 10 
      retinal diseases with accuracies ranging from 95.3% to 99.9%, without marked 
      differences between medical screening centers and geographical regions in China. 
      Compared with retinal specialists, RAIDS achieved a higher sensitivity for 
      detection of any retinal abnormality (RAIDS, 91.7% [95% CI, 90.6%-92.8%]; 
      certified ophthalmologists, 83.7% [95% CI, 82.1%-85.1%]; junior retinal 
      specialists, 86.4% [95% CI, 84.9%-87.7%]; and senior retinal specialists, 88.5% 
      [95% CI, 87.1%-89.8%]). RAIDS reached a superior or similar diagnostic 
      sensitivity compared with senior retinal specialists in the detection of 7 of 10 
      retinal diseases (ie, referral diabetic retinopathy, referral possible glaucoma, 
      macular hole, epiretinal macular membrane, hypertensive retinopathy, myelinated 
      fibers, and retinitis pigmentosa). It achieved a performance comparable with the 
      performance by certified ophthalmologists in 2 diseases (ie, age-related macular 
      degeneration and retinal vein occlusion). Compared with ophthalmologists, RAIDS 
      needed 96% to 97% less time for the image assessment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this diagnostic study, the DL system was associated with accurately 
      distinguishing 10 retinal diseases in real time. This technology may help 
      overcome the lack of experienced ophthalmologists in underdeveloped areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Retinal fundus image analysis without manual 
      intervention has been rising as an imperative analytical approach for early 
      detection of eye-related diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. For 
      analysis and detection of Glaucoma and some other disease from retinal image, 
      there is a significant role of predicting the bounding box coordinates of Optic 
      Disc (OD) that acts as a Region of Interest (ROI). METHODS: We reframe ROI 
      detection as a solitary regression predicament, from image pixel values to ROI 
      coordinates including class probabilities. A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has 
      trained on full images to predict bounding boxes along with their analogous 
      probabilities and confidence scores. The publically available MESSIDOR and Kaggle 
      datasets have been used to train the network. We adopted various data 
      augmentation techniques to amplify our dataset so that our network becomes less 
      sensitive to noise. From a very high-level perspective, every image is divided 
      into a 13 × 13 grid. Every grid cell envisages 5 bounding boxes along with the 
      corresponding class probability and a confidence score. Before training, the 
      network and the bounding box priors or anchors are initialized using k-means 
      clustering on the original dataset using a distance metric based on Intersection 
      of the Union (IOU) over ground-truth bounding boxes. During training in fact, a 
      sum-squared loss function is used as the prediction's error function. Finally, 
      Non-maximum suppression is applied by the proposed methodology to reach the 
      concluding prediction. RESULTS: The following projected method accomplish an 
      accuracy of 99.05% and 98.78% on the Kaggle and MESSIDOR test sets for ROI 
      detection. Results of proposed methodology indicates that proposed network is 
      able to perceive ROI in fundus images in 0.0045 s at 25 ms of latency, which is 
      far better than the recent-time and using no handcrafted features. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The network predicts accurate results even on low-quality images without being 
      biased towards any particular type of image. The network prepared to see more 
      summed up depiction rather than past works in the field. Going by the results, 
      our novel method has better diagnosis of eye diseases in the future in a faster 
      and reliable way.

TI  - Radiomics-based assessment of ultra-widefield leakage patterns and vessel network 
      architecture in the PERMEATE study: insights into treatment durability.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the potential of radiomics-based ultra-widefield fluorescein 
      angiography (UWFA)-derived imaging biomarkers in retinal vascular disease for 
      predicting therapeutic durability of intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI). 
      METHODS: The Peripheral and Macular Retinal Vascular Perfusion and Leakage 
      Dynamics in Diabetic Macular Edema and Retinal Venous Occlusions During 
      Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) Treatment for Retinal Edema (PERMEATE) 
      study prospectively evaluated quantitative UWFA dynamics in diabetic macular 
      oedema or macular oedema secondary to retinal vascular occlusion. 27 
      treatment-naïve eyes were treated with 2 mg IAI q4 weeks for the first 6 months, 
      and then administered q8 weeks. Morphological and graph-based attributes were 
      used to model the spatial distribution of leakage areas, while tortuosity 
      measures were used to model the vessel network disorder. Eyes were grouped based 
      on functional tolerance of the first 8-week treatment interval challenge. 
      'Non-rebounders' (N=15) maintained/improved best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
      following the 8-week challenge. 'Rebounders' (N=12) exhibited worsened BVCA. The 
      image biomarkers were used with a machine learning classifier to preliminarily 
      evaluate their ability to predict BCVA stability. RESULTS: Two new UWFA 
      image-derived biomarkers were identified and extracted. The cross-validated area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.77±0.14 using 
      baseline leakage distribution features and 0.73±0.10 for the UWFA baseline 
      tortuosity measures. Additionally, the change in vascular tortuosity between 
      month 4 and baseline yielded an AUC of 0.73±0.08. Three baseline clinical 
      features of letter score, macular volume and central subfield thickness yielded a 
      corresponding AUC of 0.42±0.09. CONCLUSIONS: Two computer-extracted UWFA 
      radiomics-based descriptors were identified as potential biomarkers for 
      predicting treatment durability and tolerance of longer treatment intervals. 
      Conventional treatment parameters were not significantly different between these 
      same groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many prognostic models of diabetic microvascular complications have 
      been developed, but their performances still varies. Therefore, we conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the performances of the existing 
      models. METHODS: Prognostic models of diabetic microvascular complications were 
      retrieved from PubMed and Scopus up to 31 December 2020. Studies were selected, 
      if they developed or internally/externally validated models of any microvascular 
      complication in type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESULTS: In total, 71 studies were 
      eligible, of which 32, 30 and 18 studies initially developed prognostic model for 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal 
      disease (ESRD) with the number of derived equations of 84, 96 and 51, 
      respectively. Most models were derived-phases, some were internal and external 
      validations. Common predictors were age, sex, HbA1c, diabetic duration, SBP and 
      BMI. Traditional statistical models (i.e. Cox and logit regression) were mostly 
      applied, otherwise machine learning. In cohorts, the discriminative performance 
      in derived-logit was pooled with C statistics of 0.82 (0.73‑0.92) for DR and 0.78 
      (0.74‑0.83) for CKD. Pooled Cox regression yielded 0.75 (0.74‑0.77), 0.78 
      (0.74‑0.82) and 0.87 (0.84‑0.89) for DR, CKD and ESRD, respectively. External 
      validation performances were sufficiently pooled with 0.81 (0.78‑0.83), 0.75 
      (0.67‑0.84) and 0.87 (0.85‑0.88) for DR, CKD and ESRD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Several prognostic models were developed, but less were externally validated. A 
      few studies derived the models by using appropriate methods and were satisfactory 
      reported. More external validations and impact analyses are required before 
      applying these models in clinical practice. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - Evaluating an automated machine learning model that predicts visual acuity 
      outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 2461-2473
LID - 10.1007/s00417-021-05544-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a major global 
      cause of blindness. Whilst anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
      treatment is effective, response varies considerably between individuals. Thus, 
      patients face substantial uncertainty regarding their future ability to perform 
      daily tasks. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an automated machine 
      learning (AutoML) model which predicts visual acuity (VA) outcomes in patients 
      receiving treatment for nAMD, in comparison to a manually coded model built using 
      the same dataset. Furthermore, we evaluate model performance across ethnic groups 
      and analyse how the models reach their predictions. METHODS: Binary 
      classification models were trained to predict whether patients' VA would be 
      'Above' or 'Below' a score of 70 one year after initiating treatment, measured 
      using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The AutoML 
      model was built using the Google Cloud Platform, whilst the bespoke model was 
      trained using an XGBoost framework. Models were compared and analysed using the 
      What-if Tool (WIT), a novel model-agnostic interpretability tool. RESULTS: Our 
      study included 1631 eyes from patients attending Moorfields Eye Hospital. The 
      AutoML model (area under the curve [AUC], 0.849) achieved a highly similar 
      performance to the XGBoost model (AUC, 0.847). Using the WIT, we found that the 
      models over-predicted negative outcomes in Asian patients and performed worse in 
      those with an ethnic category of Other. Baseline VA, age and ethnicity were the 
      most important determinants of model predictions. Partial dependence plot 
      analysis revealed a sigmoidal relationship between baseline VA and the 
      probability of an outcome of 'Above'. CONCLUSION: We have described and validated 
      an AutoML-WIT pipeline which enables clinicians with minimal coding skills to 
      match the performance of a state-of-the-art algorithm and obtain explainable 
      predictions.

TI  - Exudate-based diabetic macular edema detection in fundus images using publicly 
      available datasets.
PG  - 216-26

AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common vision threatening complication of 
      diabetic retinopathy. In a large scale screening environment DME can be assessed 
      by detecting exudates (a type of bright lesions) in fundus images. In this work, 
      we introduce a new methodology for diagnosis of DME using a novel set of features 
      based on colour, wavelet decomposition and automatic lesion segmentation. These 
      features are employed to train a classifier able to automatically diagnose DME 
      through the presence of exudation. We present a new publicly available dataset 
      with ground-truth data containing 169 patients from various ethnic groups and 
      levels of DME. This and other two publicly available datasets are employed to 
      evaluate our algorithm. We are able to achieve diagnosis performance comparable 
      to retina experts on the MESSIDOR (an independently labelled dataset with 1200 
      images) with cross-dataset testing (e.g., the classifier was trained on an 
      independent dataset and tested on MESSIDOR). Our algorithm obtained an AUC 
      between 0.88 and 0.94 depending on the dataset/features used. Additionally, it 
      does not need ground truth at lesion level to reject false positives and is 
      computationally efficient, as it generates a diagnosis on an average of 4.4s 
      (9.3s, considering the optic nerve localisation) per image on an 2.6 GHz platform 
      with an unoptimised Matlab implementation.

TI  - Four Severity Levels for Grading the Tortuosity of a Retinal Fundus Image.
LID - 10.3390/jimaging8100258 [doi]
LID - 258
AB  - Hypertensive retinopathy severity classification is proportionally related to 
      tortuosity severity grading. No tortuosity severity scale enables a 
      computer-aided system to classify the tortuosity severity of a retinal image. 
      This work aimed to introduce a machine learning model that can identify the 
      severity of a retinal image automatically and hence contribute to developing a 
      hypertensive retinopathy or diabetic retinopathy automated grading system. First, 
      the tortuosity is quantified using fourteen tortuosity measurement formulas for 
      the retinal images of the AV-Classification dataset to create the tortuosity 
      feature set. Secondly, a manual labeling is performed and reviewed by two 
      ophthalmologists to construct a tortuosity severity ground truth grading for each 
      image in the AV classification dataset. Finally, the feature set is used to train 
      and validate the machine learning models (J48 decision tree, ensemble rotation 
      forest, and distributed random forest). The best performance learned model is 
      used as the tortuosity severity classifier to identify the tortuosity severity 
      (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) for any given retinal image. The distributed 
      random forest model has reported the highest accuracy (99.4%) compared to the J48 
      Decision tree model and the rotation forest model with minimal least root mean 
      square error (0.0000192) and the least mean average error (0.0000182). The 
      proposed tortuosity severity grading matched the ophthalmologist's judgment. 
      Moreover, detecting the tortuosity severity of the retinal vessels', optimizing 
      vessel segmentation, the vessel segment extraction, and the created feature set 
      have increased the accuracy of the automatic tortuosity severity detection model.

AB  - The retina is the deepest layer of texture covering the rear of the eye, recorded 
      by fundus images. Vessel detection and segmentation are useful in disease 
      diagnosis. The retina's blood vessels could help diagnose maladies such as 
      glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and blood pressure. A mix of supervised and 
      unsupervised strategies exists for the detection and segmentation of blood 
      vessels images. The tree structure of retinal blood vessels, their random area, 
      and different thickness have caused vessel detection difficulties at machine 
      learning calculations. Since the green band of retinal images conveys more 
      information about the vessels, they are utilized for microscopic vessels 
      detection. The current research proposes an administered calculation for 
      segmentation of retinal vessels, where two upgrading stages depending on 
      filtering and comparative histogram were applied after pre-processing and image 
      quality improvement. At that point, statistical features of vessel tracking, 
      maximum curvature and curvelet coefficient are extracted for each pixel. The 
      extracted features are classified by support vector machine and the k-nearest 
      neighbors. The morphological operators then enhance the classified image at the 
      final stage to segment with higher accuracy. The dice coefficient is utilized for 
      the evaluation of the proposed method. The proposed approach is concluded to be 
      better than different strategies with a normal of 92%.

AB  - Over 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure annually. When the 
      cause of heart failure cannot be identified, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) 
      represents the gold-standard for the evaluation of disease. However, manual EMB 
      interpretation has high inter-rater variability. Deep convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to detect cancer, diabetic 
      retinopathy, and dermatologic lesions from images. In this study, we develop a 
      CNN classifier to detect clinical heart failure from H&E stained whole-slide 
      images from a total of 209 patients, 104 patients were used for training and the 
      remaining 105 patients for independent testing. The CNN was able to identify 
      patients with heart failure or severe pathology with a 99% sensitivity and 94% 
      specificity on the test set, outperforming conventional feature-engineering 
      approaches. Importantly, the CNN outperformed two expert pathologists by nearly 
      20%. Our results suggest that deep learning analytics of EMB can be used to 
      predict cardiac outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In current approaches to vision screening in the community, a simple 
      and efficient process is needed to identify individuals who should be referred to 
      tertiary eye care centres for vision loss related to eye diseases. The emergence 
      of deep learning technology offers new opportunities to revolutionise this 
      clinical referral pathway. We aimed to assess the performance of a newly 
      developed deep learning algorithm for detection of disease-related visual 
      impairment. METHODS: In this proof-of-concept study, using retinal fundus images 
      from 15 175 eyes with complete data related to best-corrected visual acuity or 
      pinhole visual acuity from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study, we 
      first developed a single-modality deep learning algorithm based on retinal 
      photographs alone for detection of any disease-related visual impairment (defined 
      as eyes from patients with major eye diseases and best-corrected visual acuity of 
      <20/40), and moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment (eyes with 
      disease and best-corrected visual acuity of <20/60). After development of the 
      algorithm, we tested it internally, using a new set of 3803 eyes from the 
      Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. We then tested it externally using 
      three population-based studies (the Beijing Eye study [6239 eyes], Central India 
      Eye and Medical study [6526 eyes], and Blue Mountains Eye Study [2002 eyes]), and 
      two clinical studies (the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Sight Threatening 
      Diabetic Retinopathy study [971 eyes] and the Outram Polyclinic Study [1225 
      eyes]). The algorithm's performance in each dataset was assessed on the basis of 
      the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). FINDINGS: In 
      the internal test dataset, the AUC for detection of any disease-related visual 
      impairment was 94·2% (95% CI 93·0-95·3; sensitivity 90·7% [87·0-93·6]; 
      specificity 86·8% [85·6-87·9]). The AUC for moderate or worse disease-related 
      visual impairment was 93·9% (95% CI 92·2-95·6; sensitivity 94·6% [89·6-97·6]; 
      specificity 81·3% [80·0-82·5]). Across the five external test datasets (16 993 
      eyes), the algorithm achieved AUCs ranging between 86·6% (83·4-89·7; sensitivity 
      87·5% [80·7-92·5]; specificity 70·0% [66·7-73·1]) and 93·6% (92·4-94·8; 
      sensitivity 87·8% [84·1-90·9]; specificity 87·1% [86·2-88·0]) for any 
      disease-related visual impairment, and the AUCs for moderate or worse 
      disease-related visual impairment ranged between 85·9% (81·8-90·1; sensitivity 
      84·7% [73·0-92·8]; specificity 74·4% [71·4-77·2]) and 93·5% (91·7-95·3; 
      sensitivity 90·3% [84·2-94·6]; specificity 84·2% [83·2-85·1]). INTERPRETATION: 
      This proof-of-concept study shows the potential of a single-modality, 
      function-focused tool in identifying visual impairment related to major eye 
      diseases, providing more timely and pinpointed referral of patients with 
      disease-related visual impairment from the community to tertiary eye hospitals.

TI  - Poster Session: Detecting spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) 
      using light-weight convolutional neural networks.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1167/jov.23.11.54 [doi]
AB  - Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a collection of 
      neuro-ophthalmic findings that occurs in astronauts as a result of prolonged 
      microgravity exposure in space. Due to limited resources on board long-term 
      spaceflight missions, early disease diagnosis and prognosis of SANS become 
      unviable. Moreover, the current retinal imaging techniques onboard the 
      international space station (ISS), such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), 
      ultrasound imaging, and fundus photography, require an expert to distinguish 
      between SANS and similar ophthalmic diseases. With the advent of Deep Learning, 
      diagnosing diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) from structural retinal images 
      are being automated. In this study, we propose a lightweight convolutional neural 
      network incorporating an EfficientNet encoder for detecting SANS from OCT images. 
      We used 6303 OCT B-scan images for training/validation (80%/20% split) and 945 
      for testing. Our model achieved 84.2% accuracy on the test set, i.e., 85.6% 
      specificity, and 82.8% sensitivity. Moreover, it outperforms two other 
      state-of-the-art pre-trained architectures, ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2, by 
      21.4% and 13.1%. Additionally, we use GRAD-CAM to visualize activation maps of 
      intermediate layers to test the interpretability of our model's prediction. The 
      proposed architecture enables fast and efficient prediction of SANS-like 
      conditions for future long-term spaceflight mission in which computational and 
      clinical resources are limited.

AB  - PURPOSE: To utilize volumetric analysis to quantify volumetric changes in 
      choroidal vessels and stroma after photodynamic therapy (PDT) and focal laser 
      photocoagulation (PC) for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). METHODS: This 
      retrospective, comparative study included 58 eyes (58 patients) with CSCR (PC, 33 
      eyes; PDT, 25 eyes) followed up with swept-source optical coherence tomography at 
      3 months after treatment. Three-dimensional (3D) choroidal vessel and stromal 
      volumes in each area of the central 1.5-mm-diameter circle, the torus-shaped area 
      with 6-mm-diameter circle excluding the area of the central 1.5-mm-diameter 
      circle, and the treated area of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
      (ETDRS) grid centered at the fovea were analyzed using a deep learning-based 
      method. Changes in volume at baseline and 1 and 3 months after treatment were 
      compared. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 49.3 ± 10.5 years. In the central 
      1.5-mm-diameter circle, the mean vessel and stromal volume rates significantly 
      decreased after the treatment in both the PDT and PC groups (P = 0.00029 and P = 
      0.0014, respectively), and significant differences between the PDT and PC groups 
      of continuous variables within times were observed in both volumes (P = 0.024 and 
      P = 0.037, respectively). In the torus-shaped area and treated area, the PDT and 
      PC groups both showed similar decreases in vessel and stromal volume over time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the 3D optical coherence tomography volumetric analysis, both PDT 
      and focal PC reduced choroid vessel volume in eyes with CSCR. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: This new finding is useful in elucidating the pathogenesis and healing 
      mechanisms of CSCR.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes 
      of vision impairment globally and early detection is crucial to prevent vision 
      loss. However, the screening of AMD is resource dependent and demands experienced 
      healthcare providers. Recently, deep learning (DL) systems have shown the 
      potential for effective detection of various eye diseases from retinal fundus 
      images, but the development of such robust systems requires a large amount of 
      datasets, which could be limited by prevalence of the disease and privacy of 
      patient. As in the case of AMD, the advanced phenotype is often scarce for 
      conducting DL analysis, which may be tackled via generating synthetic images 
      using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This study aims to develop 
      GAN-synthesized fundus photos with AMD lesions, and to assess the realness of 
      these images with an objective scale. METHODS: To build our GAN models, a total 
      of 125,012 fundus photos were used from a real-world non-AMD phenotypical 
      dataset. StyleGAN2 and human-in-the-loop (HITL) method were then applied to 
      synthesize fundus images with AMD features. To objectively assess the quality of 
      the synthesized images, we proposed a novel realness scale based on the frequency 
      of the broken vessels observed in the fundus photos. Four residents conducted two 
      rounds of gradings on 300 images to distinguish real from synthetic images, based 
      on their subjective impression and the objective scale respectively. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: The introduction of HITL training increased the percentage of 
      synthetic images with AMD lesions, despite the limited number of AMD images in 
      the initial training dataset. Qualitatively, the synthesized images have been 
      proven to be robust in that our residents had limited ability to distinguish real 
      from synthetic ones, as evidenced by an overall accuracy of 0.66 (95% CI: 
      0.61-0.66) and Cohen's kappa of 0.320. For the non-referable AMD classes (no or 
      early AMD), the accuracy was only 0.51. With the objective scale, the overall 
      accuracy improved to 0.72. In conclusion, GAN models built with HITL training are 
      capable of producing realistic-looking fundus images that could fool human 
      experts, while our objective realness scale based on broken vessels can help 
      identifying the synthetic fundus photos.

TI  - Imaging Characteristics and Clinical Utility of Half-Dose vs Full-Dose 
      Ultra-Widefield Fluorescein Angiography.

LID - 10.1016/j.oret.2024.04.024 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In early 2022, a fluorescein shortage occurred in the United States. To 
      meet the standard of care for patients who required ultra-wide fundus fluorescein 
      angiography (UWFFA), a regimen of half-dose (250mg) sodium fluorescein (10%) was 
      adopted instead of the full-dose (500mg) at the Cole Eye Institute (CEI). In this 
      paper, we compare the image quality, clinical utility, and the side effect 
      profile of half-dose vs full-dose fluorescein in UWFFA for a cohort of stable 
      patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS, AND/OR 
      CONTROLS: Patients with retinal vascular disease were included if they received 
      half-dose and full-dose UWFFA (Optos California, Dunfermline, UK) within 6 months 
      at the CEI. Eyes were excluded if they received intraocular injections, laser 
      procedures, new immunosuppression, and worsened or improved inflammation on 
      clinical examination. METHODS, INTERVENTION, OR TESTING: Quantitative assessment 
      of vascular leakage was performed using a machine-learning enhanced automated 
      segmentation platform. Leakage from late-phase UWFFA images was compared between 
      half-dose and full-dose images. Qualitative assessment of image quality and 
      relative vascular leakage was performed by 2 masked independent reviewers. Side 
      effects after fluorescein administration were recorded for each patient. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Masked leakage grading and automated leakage scores. RESULTS: 
      There were 52 eyes of 35 patients, 42 (81%) uveitic, 5 (9%) diabetic, and 4 (8%) 
      normal controls. Patients had no change to their visual acuity (LogMAR mean 
      0.3±0.6), anterior chamber and vitreous cell between UFFWA's. UWFFA images were 
      deemed of equal quality and leakage by both masked reviewers (78-87% agreement, 
      kappa 0.642). Automated leakage analysis showed mildly increased leakage in 
      half-dose images overall (3.8% vs 2.8%, p=0.01), and in the macula (1.5% vs 0.6%, 
      p=0.01). Side effects included nausea (half (n=3, 9%) vs full (n=2, 6%), p=0.69) 
      and urticaria (n=0, 0% vs n=1, 2%, p=0.99) and were not different between doses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, half dose UWFFA produced images that were of similar 
      quality, clinical utility and with a similar side effect profile compared to full 
      dose. Half dose UWFFA can be used to accurately assess the retinal vasculature 
      and could be used primarily as a method to save cost and prevent waste.

TI  - Retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for myopia and a blockchain 
      platform to facilitate artificial intelligence medical research: a retrospective 
      multicohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: By 2050, almost 5 billion people globally are projected to have 
      myopia, of whom 20% are likely to have high myopia with clinically significant 
      risk of sight-threatening complications such as myopic macular degeneration. 
      These are diagnoses that typically require specialist assessment or measurement 
      with multiple unconnected pieces of equipment. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
      approaches might be effective for risk stratification and to identify individuals 
      at highest risk of visual loss. However, unresolved challenges for AI medical 
      studies remain, including paucity of transparency, auditability, and 
      traceability. METHODS: In this retrospective multicohort study, we developed and 
      tested retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for detection of myopic 
      macular degeneration and high myopia, using a total of 226 686 retinal images. 
      First we trained and internally validated the algorithms on datasets from 
      Singapore, and then externally tested them on datasets from China, Taiwan, India, 
      Russia, and the UK. We also compared the performance of the deep learning 
      algorithms against six human experts in the grading of a randomly selected 
      dataset of 400 images from the external datasets. As proof of concept, we used a 
      blockchain-based AI platform to demonstrate the real-world application of secure 
      data transfer, model transfer, and model testing across three sites in Singapore 
      and China. FINDINGS: The deep learning algorithms showed robust diagnostic 
      performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC] 
      of 0·969 (95% CI 0·959-0·977) or higher for myopic macular degeneration and 0·913 
      (0·906-0·920) or higher for high myopia across the external testing datasets with 
      available data. In the randomly selected dataset, the deep learning algorithms 
      outperformed all six expert graders in detection of each condition (AUC of 0·978 
      [0·957-0·994] for myopic macular degeneration and 0·973 [0·941-0·995] for high 
      myopia). We also successfully used blockchain technology for data transfer, model 
      transfer, and model testing between sites and across two countries. 
      INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can be effective tools for risk 
      stratification and screening of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia among 
      the large global population with myopia. The blockchain platform developed here 
      could potentially serve as a trusted platform for performance testing of future 
      AI models in medicine. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Suitability of machine learning for atrophy and fibrosis development in 
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
LID - 10.1111/aos.16616 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the suitability of machine learning (ML) techniques in 
      predicting the development of fibrosis and atrophy in patients with neovascular 
      age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), receiving anti-VEGF treatment over a 
      36-month period. METHODS: An extensive analysis was conducted on the use of ML to 
      predict fibrosis and atrophy development on nAMD patients at 36 months from start 
      of anti-VEGF treatment, using only data from the first 12 months. We use data 
      collected according to real-world practice, which includes clinical and genetic 
      factors. RESULTS: The ML analysis consistently identified ETDRS as a relevant 
      factor for predicting the development of atrophy and fibrosis, confirming 
      previous statistical analyses. Also, it was shown that genetic variables did not 
      demonstrate statistical relevance in the prediction. Despite the complexity of 
      predicting macular degeneration, our model was able to obtain a balance accuracy 
      of 63% and an AUC of 0.72 when predicting the development of atrophy or fibrosis 
      at 36 months. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of ML techniques 
      in predicting the development of fibrosis and atrophy in nAMD patients receiving 
      long-term anti-VEGF treatment. The findings highlight the importance of clinical 
      factors, particularly ETDRS (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) visual 
      acuity test, in predicting these outcomes. The lessons learned from this research 
      can guide future ML-based prediction tasks in the field of ophthalmology and 
      contribute to the design of data collection processes.

AB  - Purpose: Retinopathy screening via digital imaging is promising for early 
      detection and timely treatment, and tracking retinopathic abnormality over time 
      can help to reveal the risk of disease progression. We developed an innovative 
      physician-oriented artificial intelligence-facilitating diagnosis aid system for 
      retinal diseases for screening multiple retinopathies and monitoring the regions 
      of potential abnormality over time. Approach: Our dataset contains 4908 fundus 
      images from 304 eyes with image-level annotations, including diabetic 
      retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, cellophane maculopathy, 
      pathological myopia, and healthy control (HC). The screening model utilized a 
      VGG-based feature extractor and multiple-binary convolutional neural 
      network-based classifiers. Images in time series were aligned via affine 
      transforms estimated through speeded-up robust features. Heatmaps of retinopathy 
      were generated from the feature extractor using gradient-weighted class 
      activation mapping++, and individual candidate retinopathy sites were identified 
      from the heatmaps using clustering algorithm. Nested cross-validation with a 
      train-to-test split of 80% to 20% was used to evaluate the performance of the 
      screening model. Results: Our screening model achieved 99% accuracy, 93% 
      sensitivity, and 97% specificity in discriminating between patients with 
      retinopathy and HCs. For discriminating between types of retinopathy, our model 
      achieved an averaged performance of 80% accuracy, 78% sensitivity, 94% 
      specificity, 79% F1-score, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70. Moreover, 
      visualization results were also shown to provide reasonable candidate sites of 
      retinopathy. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the capability of the proposed 
      model for extracting diagnostic information of the abnormality and lesion 
      locations, which allows clinicians to focus on patient-centered treatment and 
      untangles the pathological plausibility hidden in deep learning models.

AB  - In 2020, the largest U.S. health care payer, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
      Services (CMS), established payment for artificial intelligence (AI) through two 
      different systems in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) and the Inpatient 
      Prospective Payment System (IPPS). Within the MPFS, a new Current Procedural 
      Terminology code was valued for an AI tool for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, 
      IDx-RX. In the IPPS, Medicare established a New Technology Add-on Payment for 
      Viz.ai software, an AI algorithm that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of 
      large-vessel occlusion strokes. This article describes reimbursement in these two 
      payment systems and proposes future payment pathways for AI. Keywords: Computer

TI  - Acceptance and Perception of Artificial Intelligence Usability in Eye Care 
      (APPRAISE) for Ophthalmologists: A Multinational Perspective.
PG  - 875242
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.875242 [doi]
LID - 875242
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many artificial intelligence (AI) studies have focused on development 
      of AI models, novel techniques, and reporting guidelines. However, little is 
      understood about clinicians' perspectives of AI applications in medical fields 
      including ophthalmology, particularly in light of recent regulatory guidelines. 
      The aim for this study was to evaluate the perspectives of ophthalmologists 
      regarding AI in 4 major eye conditions: diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, 
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract. METHODS: This was a 
      multi-national survey of ophthalmologists between March 1st, 2020 to February 
      29th, 2021 disseminated via the major global ophthalmology societies. The survey 
      was designed based on microsystem, mesosystem and macrosystem questions, and the 
      software as a medical device (SaMD) regulatory framework chaired by the Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA). Factors associated with AI adoption for ophthalmology 
      analyzed with multivariable logistic regression random forest machine learning. 
      RESULTS: One thousand one hundred seventy-six ophthalmologists from 70 countries 
      participated with a response rate ranging from 78.8 to 85.8% per question. 
      Ophthalmologists were more willing to use AI as clinical assistive tools (88.1%, 
      n = 890/1,010) especially those with over 20 years' experience (OR 3.70, 95% CI: 
      1.10-12.5, p = 0.035), as compared to clinical decision support tools (78.8%, n = 
      796/1,010) or diagnostic tools (64.5%, n = 651). A majority of Ophthalmologists 
      felt that AI is most relevant to DR (78.2%), followed by glaucoma (70.7%), AMD 
      (66.8%), and cataract (51.4%) detection. Many participants were confident their 
      roles will not be replaced (68.2%, n = 632/927), and felt COVID-19 catalyzed 
      willingness to adopt AI (80.9%, n = 750/927). Common barriers to implementation 
      include medical liability from errors (72.5%, n = 672/927) whereas enablers 
      include improving access (94.5%, n = 876/927). Machine learning modeling 
      predicted acceptance from participant demographics with moderate to high 
      accuracy, and area under the receiver operating curves of 0.63-0.83. CONCLUSION: 
      Ophthalmologists are receptive to adopting AI as assistive tools for DR, 
      glaucoma, and AMD. Furthermore, ML is a useful method that can be applied to 
      evaluate predictive factors on clinical qualitative questionnaires. This study 
      outlines actionable insights for future research and facilitation interventions 
      to drive adoption and operationalization of AI tools for Ophthalmology.

AB  - Recent technological advancement in computing technology, communication systems, 
      and machine learning techniques provides opportunities to biomedical engineers to 
      achieve the requirements of clinical practice. This requires storage and/or 
      transmission of medical images with the conservation of the medical information 
      over the communication channel. Accordingly, medical compression is necessary for 
      efficient channel bandwidth utilization. To solve the trade-off between the 
      compression ratio and the preservation of significant information, compressed 
      sensing (CS) can be used. During image recovery in CS, an optimization algorithm 
      is used, such as greedy pursuit, convex relaxation, and Bayesian framework. In 
      the present work, a convex relaxation optimization called L1-magic is employed, 
      where the objective function can be relaxed to the nearest convex norm, i.e., 
      ℓ1-norm. In addition, the discrete cosine transform is used for recovery by 
      transforming the image from time- to frequency-domain. To improve the medical 
      image recovery, a weighted L1-magic is proposed using a threshold based on the 
      image content, where high weight is given to the significant details in the 
      image. Thus, the significant information in the image (values greater than the 
      threshold) is multiplied by a weight factor according to the image 
      characteristics for a successful recovery process. A comparative study of the 
      proposed weighted L1-magic and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), one of the 
      greedy algorithms, was conducted. Different metrics were measured, including the 
      Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to 
      evaluate CS performance using the proposed weighted L1-magic as well as the 
      weighted OMP and the principal component analysis (PCA) as a traditional 
      compression method at different compression ratios (CR). The experimental results 
      on diabetic retinopathy images dataset proved the superiority of the weighted 
      L1-magic method, where for example as 0.4 CR, average PSNR is 19.37, 17.95, and 
      15.64 using the weighted L1-magic, weighted OMP, and PCA, respectively.

TI  - Classifier ensemble based on feature selection and diversity measures for 
      predicting the affinity of A(2B) adenosine receptor antagonists.
PG  - 3140-55
LID - 10.1021/ci300516w [doi]
AB  - A(2B) adenosine receptor antagonists may be beneficial in treating diseases like 
      asthma, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, and certain cancers. This has stimulated 
      research for the development of potent ligands for this subtype, based on 
      quantitative structure-affinity relationships. In this work, a new ensemble 
      machine learning algorithm is proposed for classification and prediction of the 
      ligand-binding affinity of A(2B) adenosine receptor antagonists. This algorithm 
      is based on the training of different classifier models with multiple training 
      sets (composed of the same compounds but represented by diverse features). The 
      k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines 
      were used as single classifiers. To select the base classifiers for combining 
      into the ensemble, several diversity measures were employed. The final 
      multiclassifier prediction results were computed from the output obtained by 
      using a combination of selected base classifiers output, by utilizing different 
      mathematical functions including the following: majority vote, maximum and 
      average probability. In this work, 10-fold cross- and external validation were 
      used. The strategy led to the following results: i) the single classifiers, 
      together with previous features selections, resulted in good overall accuracy, 
      ii) a comparison between single classifiers, and their combinations in the 
      multiclassifier model, showed that using our ensemble gave a better performance 
      than the single classifier model, and iii) our multiclassifier model performed 
      better than the most widely used multiclassifier models in the literature. The 
      results and statistical analysis demonstrated the supremacy of our 
      multiclassifier approach for predicting the affinity of A(2B) adenosine receptor 
      antagonists, and it can be used to develop other QSAR models.

TI  - Metabolomic analysis of aqueous humor reveals potential metabolite biomarkers for 
      differential detection of macular edema.
PG  - 14

LID - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macular edema (ME) is a major complication of retinal disease with 
      multiple mechanisms involved in its development. This study aimed to investigate 
      the metabolite profile of aqueous humor (AH) in patients with ME of different 
      etiologies and identify potential metabolite biomarkers for early diagnosis of 
      ME. METHODS: Samples of AH were collected from 60 patients with ME and 20 age- 
      and sex-matched controls and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (LC/MS)-based metabolomics. A series of univariate and multivariate statistical 
      analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites and enriched 
      metabolite pathways. RESULTS: The metabolic profile of AH differed significantly 
      between ME patients and healthy controls, and differentially expressed 
      metabolites were identified. Pathway analysis revealed that these differentially 
      expressed metabolites are mainly involved in lipid metabolism and amino acid 
      metabolism. Moreover, significant differences were identified in the metabolic 
      composition of AH from patients with ME due to different retinal diseases 
      including age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic retinopathy (DME) 
      and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). In total, 39 and 79 
      etiology-specific altered metabolites were identified for AMD-ME and DME, 
      respectively. Finally, an AH-derived machine learning-based diagnostic model was 
      developed and successfully validated in the test cohort with an area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.79 for AMD-ME, 0.94 for DME 
      and 0.77 for BRVO-ME. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the potential underlying 
      metabolic basis of AH of different etiologies across ME populations. We also 
      identify AH-derived metabolite biomarkers that may improve the differential 
      diagnosis and treatment stratification of ME patients with different etiologies.

AB  - With the increased prevalence of retinal pathologies, automating the detection of 
      these pathologies is becoming more and more relevant. In the past few years, many 
      algorithms have been developed for the automated detection of a specific 
      pathology, typically diabetic retinopathy, using eye fundus photography. No 
      matter how good these algorithms are, we believe many clinicians would not use 
      automatic detection tools focusing on a single pathology and ignoring any other 
      pathology present in the patient's retinas. To solve this issue, an algorithm for 
      characterizing the appearance of abnormal retinas, as well as the appearance of 
      the normal ones, is presented. This algorithm does not focus on individual 
      images: it considers examination records consisting of multiple photographs of 
      each retina, together with contextual information about the patient. 
      Specifically, it relies on data mining in order to learn diagnosis rules from 
      characterizations of fundus examination records. The main novelty is that the 
      content of examination records (images and context) is characterized at multiple 
      levels of spatial and lexical granularity: 1) spatial flexibility is ensured by 
      an adaptive decomposition of composite retinal images into a cascade of regions, 
      2) lexical granularity is ensured by an adaptive decomposition of the feature 
      space into a cascade of visual words. This multigranular representation allows 
      for great flexibility in automatically characterizing normality and abnormality: 
      it is possible to generate diagnosis rules whose precision and generalization 
      ability can be traded off depending on data availability. A variation on usual 
      data mining algorithms, originally designed to mine static data, is proposed so 
      that contextual and visual data at adaptive granularity levels can be mined. This 
      framework was evaluated in e-ophtha, a dataset of 25,702 examination records from 
      the OPHDIAT screening network, as well as in the publicly-available Messidor 
      dataset. It was successfully applied to the detection of patients that should be 
      referred to an ophthalmologist and also to the specific detection of several

TI  - Target Product Profile for a Machine Learning-Automated Retinal Imaging Analysis 
      Software for Use in English Diabetic Eye Screening: Protocol for a Mixed Methods 
      Study.
PG  - e50568
LID - 10.2196/50568 [doi]
LID - e50568
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic eye screening (DES) represents a significant opportunity for 
      the application of machine learning (ML) technologies, which may improve clinical 
      and service outcomes. However, successful integration of ML into DES requires 
      careful product development, evaluation, and implementation. Target product 
      profiles (TPPs) summarize the requirements necessary for successful 
      implementation so these can guide product development and evaluation. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aims to produce a TPP for an ML-automated retinal imaging analysis 
      software (ML-ARIAS) system for use in DES in England. METHODS: This work will 
      consist of 3 phases. Phase 1 will establish the characteristics to be addressed 
      in the TPP. A list of candidate characteristics will be generated from the 
      following sources: an overview of systematic reviews of diagnostic test TPPs; a 
      systematic review of digital health TPPs; and the National Institute for Health 
      and Care Excellence's Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health 
      Technologies. The list of characteristics will be refined and validated by a 
      study advisory group (SAG) made up of representatives from key stakeholders in 
      DES. This includes people with diabetes; health care professionals; health care 
      managers and leaders; and regulators and policy makers. In phase 2, 
      specifications for these characteristics will be drafted following a series of 
      semistructured interviews with participants from these stakeholder groups. Data 
      collected from these interviews will be analyzed using the shortlist of 
      characteristics as a framework, after which specifications will be drafted to 
      create a draft TPP. Following approval by the SAG, in phase 3, the draft will 
      enter an internet-based Delphi consensus study with participants sought from the 
      groups previously identified, as well as ML-ARIAS developers, to ensure 
      feasibility. Participants will be invited to score characteristic and 
      specification pairs on a scale from "definitely exclude" to "definitely include," 
      and suggest edits. The document will be iterated between rounds based on 
      participants' feedback. Feedback on the draft document will be sought from a 
      group of ML-ARIAS developers before its final contents are agreed upon in an 
      in-person consensus meeting. At this meeting, representatives from the 
      stakeholder groups previously identified (minus ML-ARIAS developers, to avoid 
      bias) will be presented with the Delphi results and feedback of the user group 
      and asked to agree on the final contents by vote. RESULTS: Phase 1 was completed 
      in November 2023. Phase 2 is underway and expected to finish in March 2024. Phase 
      3 is expected to be complete in July 2024. CONCLUSIONS: The multistakeholder 
      development of a TPP for an ML-ARIAS for use in DES in England will help 
      developers produce tools that serve the needs of patients, health care providers, 
      and their staff. The TPP development process will also provide methods and a 
      template to produce similar documents in other disease areas. INTERNATIONAL

PG  - 44-59
LID - 10.1097/WNO.0000000000000888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), including stroke, is a leading cause 
      of death globally. The retina is an extension of the cerebrum, sharing 
      embryological and vascular pathways. The association between different retinal 
      signs and CeVD has been extensively evaluated. In this review, we summarize 
      recent studies which have examined this association. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We 
      searched 6 databases through July 2019 for studies evaluating the link between 
      retinal vascular signs and diseases with CeVD. CeVD was classified into 2 groups: 
      clinical CeVD (including clinical stroke, silent cerebral infarction, cerebral 
      hemorrhage, and stroke mortality), and sub-clinical CeVD (including MRI-defined 
      lacunar infarct and white matter lesions [WMLs]). Retinal vascular signs were 
      classified into 3 groups: classic hypertensive retinopathy (including retinal 
      microaneurysms, retinal microhemorrhage, focal/generalized arteriolar narrowing, 
      cotton-wool spots, and arteriovenous nicking), clinical retinal diseases 
      (including diabetic retinopathy [DR], age-related macular degeneration [AMD], 
      retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion [RAO], and retinal emboli), and 
      retinal vascular imaging measures (including retinal vessel diameter and 
      geometry). We also examined emerging retinal vascular imaging measures and the 
      use of artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) techniques. RESULTS: 
      Hypertensive retinopathy signs were consistently associated with clinical CeVD 
      and subclinical CeVD subtypes including subclinical cerebral large artery 
      infarction, lacunar infarction, and WMLs. Some clinical retinal diseases such as 
      DR, retinal arterial and venous occlusion, and transient monocular vision loss 
      are consistently associated with clinical CeVD. There is an increased risk of 
      recurrent stroke immediately after RAO. Less consistent associations are seen 
      with AMD. Retinal vascular imaging using computer assisted, semi-automated 
      software to measure retinal vascular caliber and other parameters (tortuosity, 
      fractal dimension, and branching angle) has shown strong associations to clinical 
      and subclinical CeVD. Other new retinal vascular imaging techniques (dynamic 
      retinal vessel analysis, adaptive optics, and optical coherence tomography 
      angiography) are emerging technologies in this field. Application of AI-DL is 
      expected to detect subclinical retinal changes and discrete retinal features in 
      predicting systemic conditions including CeVD. CONCLUSIONS: There is extensive 
      and increasing evidence that a range of retinal vascular signs and disease are 
      closely linked to CeVD, including subclinical and clinical CeVD. New technology 
      including AI-DL will allow further translation to clinical utilization.

      Future Research Directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Having several applications in medicine, and in ophthalmology in 
      particular, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been used to detect visual 
      function deficits, thus playing a key role in diagnosing eye diseases and in 
      predicting the evolution of these common and disabling diseases. AI tools, i.e., 
      artificial neural networks (ANNs), are progressively involved in detecting and 
      customized control of ophthalmic diseases. The studies that refer to the 
      efficiency of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology were analyzed in 
      this review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review in order 
      to collect all accounts published between 2015 and 2022 that refer to these 
      applications of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology. Neural networks 
      have a major role in establishing the demand to initiate preliminary 
      anti-glaucoma therapy to stop the advance of the disease. RESULTS: Different 
      surveys in the literature review show the remarkable benefit of these AI tools in 
      ophthalmology in evaluating the visual field, optic nerve, and retinal nerve 
      fiber layer, thus ensuring a higher precision in detecting advances in glaucoma 
      and retinal shifts in diabetes. We thus identified 1762 applications of 
      artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: review articles and research articles 
      (301 pub med, 144 scopus, 445 web of science, 872 science direct). Of these, we 
      analyzed 70 articles and review papers (diabetic retinopathy (N = 24), glaucoma 
      (N = 24), DMLV (N = 15), other pathologies (N = 7)) after applying the inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: In medicine, AI tools are used in surgery, 
      radiology, gynecology, oncology, etc., in making a diagnosis, predicting the 
      evolution of a disease, and assessing the prognosis in patients with oncological 
      pathologies. In ophthalmology, AI potentially increases the patient's access to 
      screening/clinical diagnosis and decreases healthcare costs, mainly when there is 
      a high risk of disease or communities face financial shortages. AI/DL (deep 
      learning) algorithms using both OCT and FO images will change image analysis 
      techniques and methodologies. Optimizing these (combined) technologies will 
      accelerate progress in this area.

TI  - Comparison of Retinal Imaging Techniques in Individuals with Pulmonary Artery 
      Hypertension Using Vessel Generation Analysis.

LID - 1985
AB  - (1) Background: Retinal vascular imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing 
      and managing chronic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell 
      retinopathy, and systemic hypertension. Previously, we have shown that 
      individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disorder, exhibit 
      unique retinal vascular changes as seen using fluorescein angiography (FA) and 
      that these changes correlate with PAH severity. This study aimed to determine if 
      color fundus (CF) imaging could garner identical retinal information as 
      previously seen using FA images in individuals with PAH. (2) Methods: VESGEN, 
      computer software which provides detailed vascular patterns, was used to compare 
      manual segmentations of FA to CF imaging in PAH subjects (n = 9) followed by deep 
      learning (DL) processing of CF imaging to increase the speed of analysis and 
      facilitate a noninvasive clinical translation. (3) Results: When manual 
      segmentation of FA and CF images were compared using VESGEN analysis, both showed 
      identical tortuosity and vessel area density measures. This remained true even 
      when separating images based on arterial trees only. However, this was not 
      observed with microvessels. DL segmentation when compared to manual segmentation 
      of CF images showed similarities in vascular structure as defined by fractal 
      dimension. Similarities were lost for tortuosity and vessel area density when 
      comparing manual CF imaging to DL imaging. (4) Conclusions: Noninvasive imaging 
      such as CF can be used with VESGEN to provide an accurate and safe assessment of 
      retinal vascular changes in individuals with PAH. In addition to providing 
      insight into possible future clinical translational use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of global death. 
      Prospective population-based studies have found that changes in retinal 
      microvasculature are associated with the development of coronary artery disease. 
      Recently, artificial intelligence deep learning (DL) algorithms have been 
      developed for the fully automated assessment of retinal vessel calibres. METHODS: 
      In this study, we validate the association between retinal vessel calibres 
      measured by a DL system (Singapore I Vessel Assessment) and incident myocardial 
      infarction (MI) and assess its incremental performance in discriminating patients 
      with and without MI when added to risk prediction models, using a large UK 
      Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Retinal arteriolar narrowing was significantly 
      associated with incident MI in both the age, gender and fellow calibre-adjusted 
      (HR=1.67 (95% CI: 1.19 to 2.36)) and multivariable models (HR=1.64 (95% CI: 1.16 
      to 2.32)) adjusted for age, gender and other cardiovascular risk factors such as 
      blood pressure, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cholesterol status. The area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.738 to 0.745 (p=0.018) 
      in the age-gender-adjusted model and from 0.782 to 0.787 (p=0.010) in the 
      multivariable model. The continuous net reclassification improvements (NRIs) were 
      significant in the age and gender-adjusted (NRI=21.56 (95% CI: 3.33 to 33.42)) 
      and the multivariable models (NRI=18.35 (95% CI: 6.27 to 32.61)). In the subgroup 
      analysis, similar associations between retinal arteriolar narrowing and incident 
      MI were observed, particularly for men (HR=1.62 (95% CI: 1.07 to 2.46)), 
      non-smokers (HR=1.65 (95% CI: 1.13 to 2.42)), patients without DM (HR=1.73 
      (95% CI: 1.19 to 2.51)) and hypertensive patients (HR=1.95 (95% CI: 1.30 to 
      2.93)) in the multivariable models. CONCLUSION: Our results support DL-based 
      retinal vessel measurements as markers of incident MI in a predominantly 
      Caucasian population.

TI  - Longitudinal assessment of quantitative ultra-widefield ischaemic and vascular 
      parameters in sickle cell retinopathy.
PG  - 251-255
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-317241 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate longitudinal quantitative ischaemic and vasculature 
      parameters, including ischaemic index, vessel area, length and geodesic distance 
      in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography 
      (UWFA). METHODS: Optimal UWFA images from two longitudinal timepoints of 74 eyes 
      from 45 patients with SCR were aligned and a common region of interest was 
      determined. A deep-learning augmented ischaemia and vascular segmentation 
      platform was used for feature extraction. Geodesic distance maps demonstrating 
      the shortest distance within the vascular masks from the centre of the optic disc 
      were created. Ischaemic index, vessel area, vessel length and geodesic distance 
      were measured. Paired t-test and linear mixed effect model analysis were 
      performed. RESULTS: Overall, 25 (44 eyes) patients with HbSS, 14 (19 eyes) with 
      HbSC, 6 (11 eyes) with HbSthal and other genotypes were included. Mean age was 
      40.1±11.0 years. Mean time interval between two UWFA studies was 23.0±15.1 months 
      (range: 3-71.3). Mean panretinal ischaemic index increased from 10.0±7.2% to 
      10.9±7.3% (p<0.005). Mean rate of change in ischaemic index was 0.5±0.7% per 
      year. Mean vessel area (p=0.020) and geodesic distance (p=0.048) decreased 
      significantly. Multivariate analysis demonstrated baseline ischaemic index and 
      Goldberg stage are correlated with progression. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal 
      ischaemic index and retinal vascular parameter measurements demonstrate 
      statistically significant progression in SCR. The clinical significance of these 
      relatively small magnitude changes remains unclear but may provide insights into 
      the progression of retinal ischaemia in SCR.

TI  - Multi-Compartment Spatially-Derived Radiomics From Optical Coherence Tomography 
      Predict Anti-VEGF Treatment Durability in Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal 
      Vascular Disease: Preliminary Findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) are the 
      leading causes of visual impairments across the world. Vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) stimulates breakdown of blood-retinal barrier that causes 
      accumulation of fluid within macula. Anti-VEGF therapy is the first-line 
      treatment for both the diseases; however, the degree of response varies for 
      individual patients. The main objective of this work was to identify the (i) 
      texture-based radiomics features within individual fluid and retinal tissue 
      compartments of baseline spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 
      images and (ii) the specific spatial compartments that contribute most pertinent 
      features for predicting therapeutic response. METHODS: A total of 962 
      texture-based radiomics features were extracted from each of the fluid and 
      retinal tissue compartments of OCT images, obtained from the PERMEATE study. 
      Top-performing features selected from the consensus of different feature 
      selection methods were evaluated in conjunction with four different machine 
      learning classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant 
      Analysis (QDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a 
      cross-validated approach to distinguish eyes tolerating extended interval dosing 
      (non-rebounders) and those requiring more frequent dosing (rebounders). RESULTS: 
      Combination of fluid and retinal tissue features yielded a cross-validated area 
      under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78±0.08 in 
      distinguishing rebounders from non-rebounders. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed 
      that the texture-based radiomics features pertaining to IRF subcompartment were 
      most discriminating between rebounders and non-rebounders to anti-VEGF therapy. 
      Clinical Impact: With further validation, OCT-based imaging biomarkers could be 
      used for treatment management of DME patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to analyze the visual outcome and systemic prognostic factors 
      for diabetic vitrectomy and predicted outcomes using these factors. METHODS: This 
      was a multicenter electronic medical records (EMRs) review study of 1504 eyes 
      with type 2 diabetes that underwent vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy at 6 university hospitals. Demographics, laboratory results, 
      intra-operative findings, and visual acuity (VA) values were analyzed and 
      correlated with visual outcomes at 1 year after the vitrectomy. Prediction models 
      for visual outcomes were obtained using machine learning. RESULTS: At 1 year, VA 
      was 1.0 logarithm of minimal angle resolution (logMAR) or greater (poor visual 
      outcome group) in 456 eyes (30%). Baseline visual acuity, duration of diabetes 
      treatment, tractional membrane, silicone oil tamponade, smoking, and vitreous 
      hemorrhage correlated with logMAR VA at 1 year (r = 0.450, -0.159, 0.221, 0.280, 
      0.067, and -0.105; all P ≤ 0.036). An ensemble decision tree model trained using 
      all variables generated accuracy, specificity, F1 score (the harmonic means of 
      which precision and sensitivity), and receiver-operating characteristic curve 
      area under curve values of 0.77, 0.66, 0.85, and 0.84 for the prediction of poor 
      visual outcomes at 1 year after vitrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Visual outcome after 
      diabetic vitrectomy is associated with pre- and intra-operative findings and 
      systemic factors. Poor visual outcome after diabetic vitrectomy was predictable 
      using clinical factors. Intensive care in patients who are predicted to result in 
      poor vision may limit vision loss resulting from type 2 diabetes. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates that a real world EMR big data could predict 
      outcome after diabetic vitrectomy using clinical factors.

AB  - Health data that are publicly available are valuable resources for digital health 
      research. Several public datasets containing ophthalmological imaging have been 
      frequently used in machine learning research; however, the total number of 
      datasets containing ophthalmological health information and their respective 
      content is unclear. This Review aimed to identify all publicly available 
      ophthalmological imaging datasets, detail their accessibility, describe which 
      diseases and populations are represented, and report on the completeness of the 
      associated metadata. With the use of MEDLINE, Google's search engine, and Google 
      Dataset Search, we identified 94 open access datasets containing 507 724 images 
      and 125 videos from 122 364 patients. Most datasets originated from Asia, North 
      America, and Europe. Disease populations were unevenly represented, with 
      glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration 
      disproportionately overrepresented in comparison with other eye diseases. The 
      reporting of basic demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and ethnicity 
      was poor, even at the aggregate level. This Review provides greater visibility 
      for ophthalmological datasets that are publicly available as powerful resources 
      for research. Our paper also exposes an increasing divide in the representation 
      of different population and disease groups in health data repositories. The 
      improved reporting of metadata would enable researchers to access the most 
      appropriate datasets for their needs and maximise the potential of such 
      resources.

AB  - Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) is the gold standard of 
      imaging the eye in clinics. Penetration depth with such devices is, however, 
      limited and visualization of the choroid, which is essential for diagnosing 
      chorioretinal disease, remains limited. Whereas swept-source OCT (SSOCT) devices 
      allow for visualization of the choroid these instruments are expensive and 
      availability in praxis is limited. We present an artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-based solution to enhance the visualization of the choroid in OCT scans and 
      allow for quantitative measurements of choroidal metrics using generative deep 
      learning (DL). Synthetically enhanced SDOCT B-scans with improved choroidal 
      visibility were generated, leveraging matching images to learn deep anatomical 
      features during the training. Using a single-center tertiary eye care institution 
      cohort comprising a total of 362 SDOCT-SSOCT paired subjects, we trained our 
      model with 150,784 images from 410 healthy, 192 glaucoma, and 133 diabetic 
      retinopathy eyes. An independent external test dataset of 37,376 images from 146 
      eyes was deployed to assess the authenticity and quality of the synthetically 
      enhanced SDOCT images. Experts' ability to differentiate real versus synthetic 
      images was poor (47.5% accuracy). Measurements of choroidal thickness, area, 
      volume, and vascularity index, from the reference SSOCT and synthetically 
      enhanced SDOCT, showed high Pearson's correlations of 0.97 [95% CI: 0.96-0.98], 
      0.97 [0.95-0.98], 0.95 [0.92-0.98], and 0.87 [0.83-0.91], with intra-class 
      correlation values of 0.99 [0.98-0.99], 0.98 [0.98-0.99], and 0.95 [0.96-0.98], 
      0.93 [0.91-0.95], respectively. Thus, our DL generative model successfully 
      generated realistic enhanced SDOCT data that is indistinguishable from SSOCT 
      images providing improved visualization of the choroid. This technology enabled 
      accurate measurements of choroidal metrics previously limited by the imaging 
      depth constraints of SDOCT. The findings open new possibilities for utilizing 
      affordable SDOCT devices in studying the choroid in both healthy and pathological 
      conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide an automated system for synthesizing fluorescein angiography 
      (FA) images from color fundus photographs for averting risks associated with 
      fluorescein dye and extend its future application to spaceflight associated 
      neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) detection in spaceflight where resources are 
      limited. DESIGN: Development and validation of a novel conditional generative 
      adversarial network (GAN) trained on limited amount of FA and color fundus images 
      with diabetic retinopathy and control cases. PARTICIPANTS: Color fundus and FA 
      paired images for unique patients were collected from a publicly available study. 
      METHODS: FA4SANS-GAN was trained to generate FA images from color fundus 
      photographs using 2 multiscale generators coupled with 2 patch-GAN 
      discriminators. Eight hundred fifty color fundus and FA images were utilized for 
      training by augmenting images from 17 unique patients. The model was evaluated on 
      56 fluorescein images collected from 14 unique patients. In addition, it was 
      compared with 3 other GAN architectures trained on the same data set. 
      Furthermore, we test the robustness of the models against acquisition noise and 
      retaining structural information when introduced to artificially created 
      biological markers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For GAN synthesis, metric Fréchet 
      Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Also, two 1-sided 
      tests (TOST) based on Welch's t test for measuring statistical significance. 
      RESULTS: On test FA images, mean FID for FA4SANS-GAN was 39.8 (standard 
      deviation, 9.9), which is better than GANgio model's mean of 43.2 (standard 
      deviation, 13.7), Pix2PixHD's mean of 57.3 (standard deviation, 11.5) and 
      Pix2Pix's mean of 67.5 (standard deviation, 11.7). Similarly for KID, FA4SANS-GAN 
      achieved mean of 0.00278 (standard deviation, 0.00167) which is better than other 
      3 model's mean KID of 0.00303 (standard deviation, 0.00216), 0.00609 (standard 
      deviation, 0.00238), 0.00784 (standard deviation, 0.00218). For TOST measurement, 
      FA4SANS-GAN was proven to be statistically significant versus GANgio (P = 0.006); 
      versus Pix2PixHD (P < 0.00001); and versus Pix2Pix (P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study has shown FA4SANS-GAN to be statistically significant for 2 GAN 
      synthesis metrics. Moreover, it is robust against acquisition noise, and can 
      retain clear biological markers compared with the other 3 GAN architectures. This 
      deployment of this model can be crucial in the International Space Station for 
      detecting SANS. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: The authors have no proprietary or 
      commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

TI  - Comparison of Central Macular Fluid Volume With Central Subfield Thickness in 
      Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema Using Optical Coherence Tomography 
      Angiography.
PG  - 734-741
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.1275 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the predominant cause of visual 
      impairment in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Automated fluid volume 
      measurements using optical coherence tomography (OCT) may improve the diagnostic 
      accuracy of DME screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of an 
      automated central macular fluid volume (CMFV) quantification using OCT for DME. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional observational study was 
      conducted at a tertiary academic center among 215 patients with diabetes (1 eye 
      each) enrolled from January 26, 2015, to December 23, 2019. All participants 
      underwent comprehensive examinations, 6 × 6-mm macular structural OCT horizontal 
      raster scans, and 6 × 6-mm macular OCT angiography volumetric scans. From January 
      1 to March 30, 2020, 2 retinal specialists reviewed the structural OCT scans 
      independently and diagnosed DME if intraretinal or subretinal fluid was present. 
      Diabetic macular edema was considered center involved if fluid was present within 
      the central fovea (central 1-mm circle). A third retinal specialist arbitrated 
      any discrepancy. The mean central subfield thickness (CST) within the central 
      fovea was measured on structural OCT horizontal raster scans. A deep learning 
      algorithm automatically quantified fluid volumes on 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography 
      volumetric scans and within the central foveas (CMFV). MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and 
      the sensitivity and specificity of CST and CMFV for DME diagnosis. RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 1 eye each of 215 patients with diabetes (117 women [54.4%]; mean [SD] 
      age, 59.6 [12.4] years). Diabetic macular edema was present in 136 eyes; 93 cases 
      of DME were center involved. The AUROC of CMFV for diagnosis of center-involved 
      DME (0.907 [95% CI, 0.861-0.954]) was greater than the AUROC of CST (0.832 [95% 
      CI, 0.775-0.889]; P = .02). With the specificity set at 95%, the sensitivity of 
      CMFV for detection of center-involved DME (78.5% [95% CI, 68.8%-86.3%]) was 
      higher than that of CST (53.8% [95% CI, 43.1%-64.2%]; P = .002). Center-involved 
      DME cases not detected by CST but detected by CMFV were associated with a thinner 
      CST (290.8 μm [95% CI, 282.3-299.3 μm] vs 369.4 μm [95% CI, 347.1-391.7 μm]; 
      P < .001), higher proportion of previous macular laser treatment (11 of 28 
      [39.3%; 95% CI, 21.5%-59.4%] vs 12 of 65 [18.5%; 95% CI, 9.9%-30.0%]; P = .03), 
      and female sex (20 of 28 [71.4%; 95% CI, 51.3%-86.8%] vs 31 of 65 [47.7%; 95% CI, 
      35.1%-60.5%]; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that an 
      automated CMFV is a more accurate diagnostic biomarker than CST for DME and may 
      improve screening for DME.

TI  - Clinical characterization of data-driven diabetes subgroups in Mexicans using a 
      reproducible machine learning approach.
LID - 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001550 [doi]
LID - e001550
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous reports in European populations demonstrated the existence 
      of five data-driven adult-onset diabetes subgroups. Here, we use self-normalizing 
      neural networks (SNNN) to improve reproducibility of these data-driven diabetes 
      subgroups in Mexican cohorts to extend its application to more diverse settings. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained SNNN and compared it with k-means 
      clustering to classify diabetes subgroups in a multiethnic and representative 
      population-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
      datasets with all available measures (training sample: NHANES-III, n=1132; 
      validation sample: NHANES 1999-2006, n=626). SNNN models were then applied to 
      four Mexican cohorts (SIGMA-UIEM, n=1521; Metabolic Syndrome cohort, n=6144; 
      ENSANUT 2016, n=614 and CAIPaDi, n=1608) to characterize diabetes subgroups in 
      Mexicans according to treatment response, risk for chronic complications and risk 
      factors for the incidence of each subgroup. RESULTS: SNNN yielded four 
      reproducible clinical profiles (obesity related, insulin deficient, insulin 
      resistant, age related) in NHANES and Mexican cohorts even without C-peptide 
      measurements. We observed in a population-based survey a high prevalence of the 
      insulin-deficient form (41.25%, 95% CI 41.02% to 41.48%), followed by 
      obesity-related (33.60%, 95% CI 33.40% to 33.79%), age-related (14.72%, 95% CI 
      14.63% to 14.82%) and severe insulin-resistant groups. A significant association 
      was found between the SLC16A11 diabetes risk variant and the obesity-related 
      subgroup (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.83, p=0.008). Among incident cases, we 
      observed a greater incidence of mild obesity-related diabetes (n=149, 45.0%). In 
      a diabetes outpatient clinic cohort, we observed increased 1-year risk (HR 1.59, 
      95% CI 1.01 to 2.51) and 2-year risk (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.31) for incident 
      retinopathy in the insulin-deficient group and decreased 2-year diabetic 
      retinopathy risk for the obesity-related subgroup (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes subgroup phenotypes are reproducible using SNNN; our 
      algorithm is available as web-based tool. Application of these models allowed for 
      better characterization of diabetes subgroups and risk factors in Mexicans that 
      could have clinical applications.

TI  - The paradigm change from reactive medical services to 3PM in ischemic stroke: a 
      holistic approach utilising tear fluid multi-omics, mitochondria as a vital 
      biosensor and AI-based multi-professional data interpretation.
PG  - 1-23

AB  - Worldwide stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause 
      of death and disability combined. The estimated global economic burden by stroke 
      is over US$891 billion per year. Within three decades (1990-2019), the incidence 
      increased by 70%, deaths by 43%, prevalence by 102%, and DALYs by 143%. Of over 
      100 million people affected by stroke, about 76% are ischemic stroke (IS) 
      patients recorded worldwide. Contextually, ischemic stroke moves into particular 
      focus of multi-professional groups including researchers, healthcare industry, 
      economists, and policy-makers. Risk factors of ischemic stroke demonstrate 
      sufficient space for cost-effective prevention interventions in primary 
      (suboptimal health) and secondary (clinically manifested collateral disorders 
      contributing to stroke risks) care. These risks are interrelated. For example, 
      sedentary lifestyle and toxic environment both cause mitochondrial stress, 
      systemic low-grade inflammation and accelerated ageing; inflammageing is a 
      low-grade inflammation associated with accelerated ageing and poor stroke 
      outcomes. Stress overload, decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics and 
      hypomagnesaemia are associated with systemic vasospasm and ischemic lesions in 
      heart and brain of all age groups including teenagers. Imbalanced dietary 
      patterns poor in folate but rich in red and processed meat, refined grains, and 
      sugary beverages are associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia, systemic 
      inflammation, small vessel disease, and increased IS risks. Ongoing 3PM research 
      towards vulnerable groups in the population promoted by the European Association 
      for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) demonstrates 
      promising results for the holistic patient-friendly non-invasive approach 
      utilising tear fluid-based health risk assessment, mitochondria as a vital 
      biosensor and AI-based multi-professional data interpretation as reported here by 
      the EPMA expert group. Collected data demonstrate that IS-relevant risks and 
      corresponding molecular pathways are interrelated. For examples, there is an 
      evident overlap between molecular patterns involved in IS and diabetic 
      retinopathy as an early indicator of IS risk in diabetic patients. Just to 
      exemplify some of them such as the 5-aminolevulinic acid/pathway, which are also 
      characteristic for an altered mitophagy patterns, insomnia, stress regulation and 
      modulation of microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk. Further, ceramides are considered 
      mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiometabolic disease, 
      negatively affecting mitochondrial respiratory chain function and fission/fusion 
      activity, altered sleep-wake behaviour, vascular stiffness and remodelling. 
      Xanthine/pathway regulation is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and 
      stress-driven anxiety-like behaviour as well as molecular mechanisms of arterial 
      stiffness. In order to assess individual health risks, an application of machine 
      learning (AI tool) is essential for an accurate data interpretation performed by 
      the multiparametric analysis. Aspects presented in the paper include the needs of 
      young populations and elderly, personalised risk assessment in primary and 
      secondary care, cost-efficacy, application of innovative technologies and 
      screening programmes, advanced education measures for professionals and general 
      population-all are essential pillars for the paradigm change from reactive 
      medical services to 3PM in the overall IS management promoted by the EPMA.

TI  - Artificial intelligence applications in social media for depression screening: A 
      systematic review protocol for content validity processes.
PG  - e0259499
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0259499 [doi]
LID - e0259499
AB  - BACKGROUND: The popularization of social media has led to the coalescing of user 
      groups around mental health conditions; in particular, depression. Social media 
      offers a rich environment for contextualizing and predicting users' self-reported 
      burden of depression. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods are commonly 
      employed in analyzing user-generated sentiment on social media. In the 
      forthcoming systematic review, we will examine the content validity of these 
      computer-based health surveillance models with respect to standard diagnostic 
      frameworks. Drawing from a clinical perspective, we will attempt to establish a 
      normative judgment about the strengths of these modern AI applications in the 
      detection of depression. METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of English 
      and German language publications from 2010 to 2020 in PubMed, APA PsychInfo, 
      Science Direct, EMBASE Psych, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The inclusion 
      criteria span cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, randomized 
      controlled studies, in addition to reports on conference proceedings. The 
      systematic review will exclude some gray source materials, specifically 
      editorials, newspaper articles, and blog posts. Our primary outcome is 
      self-reported depression, as expressed on social media. Secondary outcomes will 
      be the types of AI methods used for social media depression screen, and the 
      clinical validation procedures accompanying these methods. In a second step, we 
      will utilize the evidence-strengthening Population, Intervention, Comparison, 
      Outcomes, Study type (PICOS) tool to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
      Following the independent assessment of the evidence sources by two authors for 
      the risk of bias, the data extraction process will culminate in a thematic 
      synthesis of reviewed studies. DISCUSSION: We present the protocol for a 
      systematic review which will consider all existing literature from peer reviewed 
      publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes. The completed 
      review will discuss depression as a self-reported health outcome in social media 
      material. We will examine the computational methods, including AI and machine 
      learning techniques which are commonly used for online depression surveillance. 
      Furthermore, we will focus on standard clinical assessments, as indicating 
      content validity, in the design of the algorithms. The methodological quality of 
      the clinical construct of the algorithms will be evaluated with the 
      COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement

AB  - Due to the reactive medical approach applied to disease management, stroke has 
      reached an epidemic scale worldwide. In 2019, the global stroke prevalence was 
      101.5 million people, wherefrom 77.2 million (about 76%) suffered from ischemic 
      stroke; 20.7 and 8.4 million suffered from intracerebral and subarachnoid 
      haemorrhage, respectively. Globally in the year 2019 - 3.3, 2.9 and 0.4 million 
      individuals died of ischemic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
      respectively. During the last three decades, the absolute number of cases 
      increased substantially. The current prevalence of stroke is 110 million patients 
      worldwide with more than 60% below the age of 70 years. Prognoses by the World 
      Stroke Organisation are pessimistic: globally, it is predicted that 1 in 4 adults 
      over the age of 25 will suffer stroke in their lifetime. Although age is the best 
      known contributing factor, over 16% of all strokes occur in teenagers and young 
      adults aged 15-49 years and the incidence trend in this population is increasing. 
      The corresponding socio-economic burden of stroke, which is the leading cause of 
      disability, is enormous. Global costs of stroke are estimated at 721 billion US 
      dollars, which is 0.66% of the global GDP. Clinically manifested strokes are only 
      the "tip of the iceberg": it is estimated that the total number of stroke 
      patients is about 14 times greater than the currently applied reactive medical 
      approach is capable to identify and manage. Specifically, lacunar stroke (LS), 
      which is characteristic for silent brain infarction, represents up to 30% of all 
      ischemic strokes. Silent LS, which is diagnosed mainly by routine health check-up 
      and autopsy in individuals without stroke history, has a reported prevalence of 
      silent brain infarction up to 55% in the investigated populations. To this end, 
      silent brain infarction is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. Further, 
      small vessel disease and silent lacunar brain infarction are considered strong 
      contributors to cognitive impairments, dementia, depression and suicide, amongst 
      others in the general population. In sub-populations such as diabetes mellitus 
      type 2, proliferative diabetic retinopathy is an independent predictor of 
      ischemic stroke. According to various statistical sources, cryptogenic strokes 
      account for 15 to 40% of the entire stroke incidence. The question to consider 
      here is, whether a cryptogenic stroke is fully referable to unidentifiable 
      aetiology or rather to underestimated risks. Considering the latter, 
      translational research might be of great clinical utility to realise innovative 
      predictive and preventive approaches, potentially benefiting high risk 
      individuals and society at large. In this position paper, the consortium has 
      combined multi-professional expertise to provide clear statements towards the 
      paradigm change from reactive to predictive, preventive and personalised medicine 
      in stroke management, the crucial elements of which are:Consolidation of 
      multi-disciplinary expertise including family medicine, predictive and in-depth 
      diagnostics followed by the targeted primary and secondary (e.g. treated cancer) 
      prevention of silent brain infarctionApplication of the health risk assessment 
      focused on sub-optimal health conditions to effectively prevent health-to-disease 
      transitionApplication of AI in medicine, machine learning and treatment 
      algorithms tailored to robust biomarker patternsApplication of innovative 
      screening programmes which adequately consider the needs of young populations.
